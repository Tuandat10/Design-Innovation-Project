Hydrogen Headstart to power new jobs & industry

Joint media release with

The Hon Chris Bowen MP
Minister for Climate Change and Energy

Senator the Hon Jenny McAllister
Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy

The Albanese Government’s second Budget is ensuring Australia can reach its potential as a
renewable energy superpower, with $2 billion for a new Hydrogen Headstart program to scale up
development of Australia’s renewable hydrogen industry.

This critical new investment is all about making Australia a global leader in green hydrogen, as
competition for clean energy investment accelerates around the world.

The net zero transformation is the largest change to both Australia and the world’s economy since
the industrial revolution. After a decade of policy inaction, Hydrogen Headstart contributes to the
over $40 billion of investment by the Albanese Government to make Australia a renewable energy
superpower.

Australia already has the largest pipeline of renewable hydrogen projects in the world. Our regions
have the resources, technical skills and key trade partnerships to drive growth in hydrogen and other
clean industries, as well as the jobs that come with it.

Getting to net zero emissions will require renewable hydrogen. Analysis by ClimateWorks and
ARENA found as much as 364,000 tonnes (44PJ) is required by 2030 and 2,230,000 tonnes
(268PJ) required by 2050 for industrial decarbonisation.

Hydrogen can be combusted for industrial heat, used as a chemical input for green manufacturing, a
fuel for heavy transport, or liquified and compressed for export to our key trading partners.

Green hydrogen is also a critical enabler for future manufacturing of green metals and other
products the world needs as the transformation to net zero by 2050 gathers pace.

The Albanese Government is helping to unlock clean industry growth through:

$2 billion for Hydrogen Headstart, providing revenue support for large‑scale renewable
hydrogen projects through competitive hydrogen production contracts. These will help bridge the
commercial gap for early projects and put Australia on course for up to a gigawatt of electrolyser
capacity by 2030 through 2 to 3 flagship projects.
$38.2 million in funding for a Guarantee of Origin scheme, which will certify renewable energy
and track and verify emissions from clean energy products – in particular hydrogen. This is
critical funding to ensure Australia is seen as an attractive investment destination, to accelerate
investment in an Australian hydrogen industry and to support access to future markets for
verified renewable and clean products.
$2.0 million to establish a fund to support First Nations people and businesses to engage with
hydrogen project proponents, planning processes and program design.

Importantly, the Government will also provide $5.6 million to support further work on the best ways
to leverage Australia’s competitive strengths in renewable energy, critical minerals and highly skilled
workforce to accelerate our other clean industrial and manufacturing capabilities, with further actions
to be identified by the end of 2023.

These commitments build on over half a billion dollars of investment by the Albanese Government in
regional hydrogen hubs, which will drive investments in this new industry across regions including
Gladstone, the Hunter, Bell Bay and the Pilbara.

Developing Australia’s hydrogen industry will help ensure Australia remains a reliable energy partner
to our key regional trading partners through the energy transformation.

This investment will build critical domestic experience and expertise, and help Australia connect to
global supply chains to take advantage of the immense jobs and investment potential of green
hydrogen.

These commitments will build on Australia’s established hydrogen strengths and ensure the regions
that have always powered Australia are well positioned in the global race for clean energy
investment and jobs, securing Australia’s future as a renewable energy superpower.

Making good on Australia’s hydrogen
headstart

Article | Australia | 2024-07-26

The Federal Government is doubling down on its Hydrogen Headstart initiative, which aims

to fuel the growth of Australia’s green hydrogen energy industry. 

With the most recent federal budget, more than $3.3 billion is now going towards
investments to accelerate the nation’s embrace of the future fuel . But Australia already has a
head start on hydrogen energy. 

1

In fact, in 2022, Australia became the first nation to ever export liquid hydrogen. ABB
provided end-to-end engineering and project management support for the Hydrogen Energy

Supply Chain (HESC) pilot, helping liquify hydrogen at the Port of Hastings in Victoria before
shipping it to Kobe, Japan. 

It was a pioneering effort to demonstrate the viability of international, mass-scale hydrogen
transportation networks, and ABB was excited to be involved, supplying everything from
instrumentation and electrification solutions through to automated systems. 

HESC demonstrated that Australia could become a hydrogen energy superpower, but that
does not mean dominance of this new energy market is inevitable. 

Even with other natural advantages, such as renewable energy capacity, proximity to major
Asian export markets and a workforce with highly relevant skills and experience building a
world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry, we still have a way to go  to win
the race. 

Developing a competitive industry that can place Australia at the forefront of becoming a
hydrogen superpower will require coordination of disparate economic actors and integrating

complex supply chains. Partners with broad capabilities will be essential to navigating the
new zero-emissions hydrogen ecosystem.   

Hydrogen energy competition 

The Headstart program has shortlisted six projects for potential share of funding  that
together represent a total electrolyser capacity of more than 3.5 GW – not far off double the
existing global electrolyser capacity. 

2

In addition, a hydrogen production tax incentive worth $6.7 billion will support renewable
hydrogen produced from 2027, while a further boost arrives via the Future Made in Australia
initiative, which seeks to increase investment in hydrogen capacity and green metal
production. 

But this effort is part of a race to hydrogen dominance being fought internationally.

Australia’s measures are competing, for instance, with the US’s Inflation Reduction Act,

which contains the most generous hydrogen subsidies in the world.  Tax credits of up to

3

US$3 a kilogram for green hydrogen mean that the US has already made it cost-competitive

with grey hydrogen.

4

Why hydrogen experience matters 

Of course, creating a green hydrogen ecosystem starts with producing green hydrogen.  

With most green hydrogen production not yet cost-competitive with traditional approaches
to hydrogen production, maximising the efficiency of the plant – such as the electrolysers

green hydrogen production depends on – is vital for the success of green hydrogen energy. 

The faster the industry can drive up overall efficiency, the quicker it becomes cost
competitive not just with grey hydrogen, but with other fossil-fuelled energy sources as well. 
In the French city of Auxerre, an ABB energy management system has reduced energy costs
by up to 16% at a low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution station. 

The station uses ABB’s Optimax software to increase the efficiency of the energy-intensive
electrolysers that are used in green hydrogen production. By providing data to determine
optimal energy consumption levels during the production process, while minimising waste,
the technology improves efficiency at every step of the plant’s lifecycle, from design and
engineering through to operation. 

Optimax also considers such factors as asset availability and price variation, and the
hydrogen produced from the improved electrolysis processes at the plant is used to supply

buses, light commercial vehicles and trucks in the local transit network, saving thousands of
tonnes of carbon emissions each year.    

ABB is also making efficiency gains with modular green hydrogen plants in Italy, using
automation, electrification, and digital leadership in industrial operations to lower the
carbon footprint and reduce operating costs. Leveraging this domain expertise is helping to
minimise the total cost of running the plant, enabling widespread uptake of hydrogen in the
future. 

Energy now, energy later 

The hydrogen ecosystem depends upon more than production, however. A key advantage of
green hydrogen is its ability to store and relocate green energy, but it also comes with some
challenges. 

Hydrogen in gaseous form is three times less energy-dense than methane, making it much
costlier to transport. While it requires less energy to transport hydrogen if it is first
converted to ammonia, this adds environmental risks, and the ammonia will still need to be

converted back to hydrogen at its destination. Although hydrogen can be transferred

through existing pipeline infrastructure, these connections must be retrofitted if they are to

carry a hydrogen blend that exceeds 20%. 

ABB’s transportation technology seeks to address these inefficiencies and technical

challenges by incorporating containerised, modular automation infrastructure; tank farm
automation; and compressor and pumping stations. 

It was ABB technology like this that brought Australia’s HESC pilot into reality. Although

pipelines are suitable for inland transport of bulk quantities of hydrogen, the trans-oceanic
distances involved in HESC require the gas to be converted into a higher density form, such

as liquid. 

Significant costs can be involved in both this conversion process and the transportation.       It is

estimated that the cost of converting and moving hydrogen 1500 km by ship comes to US
$0.6/kg for liquid organic hydrogen compounds, US$1.20/kg for ammonia and US$2/kg for

liquid hydrogen.  Managing collecting systems and tanking facilities in a safe way also
requires specialised technology and deep expertise. 

5

ABB’s support for HESC incorporated electrification and instrumentation solutions, along

with services for production and liquefaction in Australia, as well providing automation for
the regasification plant at the Japanese end.    

Fuelling up 

Once transported, hydrogen needs the right systems and processes in place at the

consumption end before it can be used effectively. Existing infrastructure such as gas

turbines and household appliances can handle a mixture of methane and varying amounts of
methane and hydrogen (5% to 30 %, depending on what is used for), and new designs could

increase the viable concentration of hydrogen.  

Fuel cells are already available in cars and suitable for other transportation systems, and
they’re widely used to provide heat and power for critical infrastructure such as hospitals.

There is potential, too, for residential scale use, although current costs in this sector are
high.  ABB’s domain expertise and understanding is doing much to refine the downstream

processes that make hydrogen consumption more viable. Hydrogen is a highly flexible form
of energy storage, and ABB initiatives have demonstrated how it can be used in small and

large projects on water and on land. 

ABB is working with Hydrogene de France to build megawatt-scale fuel cell systems suitable
for large ocean-going ships, while a 2021 pilot program had fully hydrogen-powered vessels

operating in the Rhone River under the EU’s Flagships initiative. For this, ABB provided fuel
cell-based power and propulsion, which drew entirely on emission-free, shore-based power. 

Another vessel included in the initiative is a self-propelled barge designed to operate on the

Seine in Paris. Originally designed to use diesel-electric power, the barge was reconfigured to
store 350 kg of hydrogen at a pressure of 300 bar, fuelling 200 kW fuel cells supported by

lithium-ion batteries that adjust their power supply to ensure optimal performance. 

On land, the US’s first hydrogen-powered train will operate along a 15 km stretch of track in
San Bernardino, California, as part of the Redlands Passenger Rail Project. The locomotive is

supported by ABB traction systems in the form of a traction converter, a DC/DC converter,
three 28 kWh battery packages, and a battery thermal management system.    

Building partnerships 

The nascent green hydrogen sector needs partners with broad capability across power

systems and process control to simplify the project by reducing the number of cooks in the

kitchen, particularly when managing complex projects spanning sectors such as pipelines,
renewable power and shipping. 

Space for renewable energy generation and supportive government policies are two key

ingredients for building a thriving green hydrogen sector, but there is a third as well –
effective partnerships, to ensure the inputs create quality outcomes. 

As ABB has demonstrated, its expertise has already taken pioneering hydrogen projects from

conception to reality, showing a concrete way forward for a fuel source that is seeing rapid
take up and significant investment. These are the factors helping to take Australia’s innate

strength as a potential player in the green hydrogen ecosystem and make it into a sophisti-
cated and lucrative industry.

Hydrogen Headstart program

The Australian Government has announced a further $2 billion for an additional round of Hydrogen Headstart. This funding was

announced in the 2024-25 Federal budget. 

Register your interest in Hydrogen Headstart Round 2  (https://arena.gov.au/funding/hydrogen-headstart-round2/) .

The Australian Government is investing $4 billion in the Hydrogen Headstart program. Headstart will provide revenue support for large-scale

renewable hydrogen projects through competitive hydrogen production contracts.

This investment will:

accelerate development of Australia’s hydrogen industry

catalyse clean energy industries

help Australia connect to new global hydrogen supply chains.

Headstart will take advantage of hydrogen's immense jobs and investment potential.

It will help bridge the commercial gap for first mover projects.

A further $4 million will be provided to help First Nations communities engage with hydrogen project developers.

Unlocking a vibrant domestic hydrogen industry is critical to our vision of being a Renewable Energy Superpower and for a future made in

Australia.

How will it work?

The program uses a competitive process to select large Australian-based projects. It focuses on projects producing hydrogen from renewable

energy, or derivative products (for example ammonia or methanol).

Successful projects will have the opportunity to receive funding as a production credit. This funding credit will cover the current commercial

gap between the cost of producing renewable hydrogen and its market price. This should enable producers to offer hydrogen to users at a price

that will encourage its use.

The Australian Government announced (/about/news/hydrogen-headstart-applicants-are-potential-world-leaders) shortlisted projects on 21

December 2023.
