The aggregate ARENA funding (capital grant + production credits ) for a single project is expected
to be in the range of $10 million – $350 million. Applicants don’t need to be headquartered in
Australia, but they must hold an Australian Business Number (ABN) and be an Australian entity
incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001. Each project must take place primarily in Australia,
and co-funding commitments will play a role in the application assessment process.

Is Solar Sunshot Worth The Effort And Expense?

Given the massive scale of solar PV production elsewhere, especially in China, some have
questioned whether it’s a waste of money embarking on Solar Sunshot. ARENA acknowledges
we’re behind the eight-ball and expects it will take “some time” for Australian manufacturing to
become competitive on a global scale.

ARENA says the initiative will also support elements of the supply chain where Australia can be
most competitive, particularly given local access to abundant raw materials such as

“We need to build on our history of innovation and extend this into manufacturing across the

solar supply chain,” 

said ARENA CEO Darren Miller

. “The demand for solar required to meet our

net zero and renewable energy superpower goals is immense and Australia has the opportunity

to build resilience and unlock long-term economic opportunity.”

I was told recently that Tindo panels, while manufactured in Australia, use predominantly Chinese
components. Just wondering if that is indeed true. I’m considering using Tindo panels…. But not if
they are being misleading on their origin.

Hi Graham,

Tindo assemble panels here in a factory that’s actually smaller than the experimental R&D
production line that Longi have in China. ie the chinese make 90% of the worlds solar and so
getting the components there isn’t something exceptional.

BP used to make solar here in Australia, if you remember Telecom remote area phone boxes
and the first solar car to cross Australia, they used BP cells. The plant they were made in
Sydney was taken over by Silex for a short time but then closed.

I can’t help but mention that the olympic village in Sydney had BP solar panels on it, while
Holden & the CSIRO developed a hybrid eCommodore 25 years ago. While John Howard spent
10 times more R&D money subsidising “clean coal” than he did on renewables. UNSW
developed the PERC technology used in most modern solar cells but as mentioned 90% are
made in China…

It’s worth considering Donald Horne’s full quote:

Australia is a lucky country… run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on
other people’s ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all
fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by
surprise.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is set to establish its Solar Sunshot program thanks to a $1 billion funding

commitment.

The Federal Government announced the establishment of the program, designed to help unlock domestic solar photovoltaic (PV)

manufacturing across the entire supply chain and grow solar PV manufacturing in Australia, which outlines a pathway to the

commercialisation of local solar PV innovation.

The program will be delivered by ARENA, with development and design to be done in collaboration with the Department of Climate

Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW).

ARENA Chief Executive O cer, Darren Miller, said, “ARENA has been at the forefront of building Australia’s solar PV industry through

its support for research, innovation and large-scale deployment. This has helped solar to become our cheapest form of energy.

“We’re pleased to see the Federal Government recognise ARENA’s wealth of experience and close relationships with industry by

calling on us to deliver the Solar Sunshot program.

“To date, ARENA has invested more than $830 million towards 233 solar PV projects. We are ready to take on the next step

alongside others in the solar industry to create a domestic solar manufacturing industry,” Mr Miller said.

Solar Sunshot is intended to provide support across the solar PV supply chain, including the scaling up of module manufacturing

capabilities and exploration of other areas of the supply chain where grant funding can help kickstart the industry. This could include

polysilicon, ingots and wafers, cells, module assembly, and other parts of the solar supply chain, including solar glass, advanced



deployment technology, or other aspects identi ed through industry consultation.

ARENA funded the Australian Photovoltaic Institute’s (APVI) Silicon to Solar Report to investigate solar manufacturing capability and

potential in Australia. The report outlined a credible pathway for a domestic supply chain that could result in bene ts such as

securing access to solar PV components as Australia signi cantly scales up deployment of solar PV, creating local jobs, attracting

signi cant private investment and unlocking potential export opportunities.

ARENA and DCCEEW said they will publish a consultation paper outlining proposed speci cations for the program, including

objectives, funding mechanisms, timings, and draft eligibility and merit criteria.

“Australia has the opportunity to build high quality products across the solar PV supply chain. Although we have a very small

production capability today, we have the skills and the partnerships to establish a strong base that can be built on over the next

decade,” Mr Miller said.

“To unlock our renewable energy superpower vision, we need to be able to play a part in the whole supply chain, while also working

with international partners and leveraging learnings as we build our own capability to complement the global market.

“We’ll be consulting widely with industry and other stakeholders to hear their views and inform what will be a transformative scale up

of Australia’s solar PV manufacturing capacity.”

Following the consultation period, ARENA and DCCEEW will develop the  nal program design.

Industry comment

The Climate Council has welcomed the announcement and said that the initiative will cut climate pollution and create clean jobs for

generations of workers across regional Australia. 

Climate Council Head of Policy and Advocacy, Jennifer Rayner, said, “This is Australia’s time to shine. We’ve got some of the best

solar resources in the world and, as a nation, we love harnessing the power of the sun to electrify our lives. Already, more than three

million Australian households have put panels on their roofs to save money and reduce climate pollution. 

“Climate Council’s new Seize the Decade report highlights the importance of enabling millions more households to install solar. It’s

key to continuing the build out of our clean energy grid, cutting climate pollution and helping families take control of their energy

bills. This investment from the government is a welcome, practical step towards making that possible. 

“Manufacturing solar panels here at home will make this proven technology more accessible for all Australians, and create more

good, long-term jobs for our young people in regional energy hubs like the Hunter. This is what seizing the decade and securing a

safer, more prosperous future for our kids looks like,” Ms Rayner said.

Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said, “Today’s announcement by the Federal Government of the $1 billion Solar

Sunshot program to support the manufacturing of solar panels in Australia through production subsidies and grants is a major shot

in the arm that will underpin our future as a renewable energy superpower.


“Australia has led the rest of the world in the research, development and uptake of rooftop solar systems, but we have thus far
missed the opportunity to manufacture more of these components here at home. This is about to change.



“We are a country rich in renewable energy resources, such as land, coastline and sunshine that have yet to be harnessed to their full

potential.

“More than 3.7 million Australian homes have installed rooftop solar, with almost half a million new systems being installed every

year. This commitment will mean that more of these systems will contain products made right here in Australia.

“The missing piece of the puzzle here is establishing a strong sovereign manufacturing capability that captures this innovation and

expertise to meet more of the extraordinary demand, both here and overseas, for solar products.

“We look forward to working with the government on establishing a detailed design and timely implementation of this policy,” Mr

Thompson said.

,Solar SunShot manufacturing
program enters design phase

The consultation process has commenced on the design of the $1
billion Solar Sunshot program that aims to boost the development of
Australia’s solar manufacturing industry and increase the nation’s
role in the global solar manufacturing supply chain.

The Solar Sunshot program, announced by the federal government earlier

this month as a way “to supercharge Australia’s ambition to become a

renewable energy superpower at home and abroad,” will see the

government funding production subsidies and grants under the auspices

of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

The $1 billion (USD 650 million) initiative aims to support manufacturing

facilities in Australia across the solar supply chain, including polysilicon

production, production of ingots, wafers, solar PV cells, and solar module

assembly. The program may also support complementary aspects of the

PV supply chain such as solar glass, module frames and deployment

technology.

ARENA, which will design the program in collaboration with the

Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water

(DCCEEW), has now published a consultation paper outlining a proposed

structure for the package that could see it delivered through a series of

funding rounds supporting targeted stages of the supply chain.

Under the program, production-linked payments are proposed to be the

primary form of  nancial support. ARENA said it will also assess how

capital grant funding or other forms of concessional support can be used

to complement production-linked payments to achieve the program

objectives.

ARENA is seeking information on prospective projects under development

or project concepts that could fall under the Solar Sunshot umbrella. The

agency said this will enable it to better understand overall readiness and

appetite of the market to develop projects in di erent areas of the supply

chain and will be used to develop  nal design parameters for the program.

ARENA Chief Executive Darren Miller said the agency will work closely

with industry to shape a program that supports “innovative and

competitive solar PV manufacturing that is critical to securing Australia’s

role in the transition to a net zero world.”

“The scale at which solar needs to be deployed to meet our climate targets

means that we cannot rely solely on importing solar panels from

overseas,” he said, adding that Australia can drive a greater role in PV

production to make the supply chain less vulnerable.

“There is a credible pathway for building a solar manufacturing industry in

Australia,” he said. “A collaborative and committed approach from

government and the private sector gives us the best chance at tackling this

challenge.”

The consultation remains open until 31 May 2024 with ARENA accepting

written submissions through online forms and also hosting two

consultation webinars.

Australia is a step closer to manufacturing more reliable renewables at home, with the Albanese Government’s $1 billion Solar

Sunshot program now open.

Australia has always been a solar powerhouse – the ideas invented here have lit the way for the global energy transformation

underway. 

But while one in three Australian households have solar – the highest take-up in the world – only one per cent of those solar panels

have been made in Australia.

That’s why we’re investing in Australia’s solar capability with targeted funding to support a Future Made In Australia, create quality

jobs for Australian workers and a more resilient supply chain.

The International Energy Agency estimates 1300 manufacturing jobs for each gigawatt of solar PV production, meaning a

supercharged domestic industry will create thousands of jobs in Australia.

Initiatives like Solar Sunshot will build  capability in the energy supply chains of the future, and support more manufacturing

opportunities across the country driven by our renewable transformation.

The first $550 million, administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), will support the commercialisation of

Australian solar photovoltaic (PV) innovations and scale up Australian solar PV manufacturing. This includes: 

Round 1A: $500 million to support solar panel manufacturing, here in Australia, with a focus on modules, inputs to modules,

and deployment systems.

Round 1B: $50 million to fund solar PV manufacturing studies, including feasibility and engineering.

As the Treasury’s National Interest Framework sets out: the high concentration of supply chains for critical energy technologies

poses risks to Australia’s energy security and economic resilience.

These technologies are critical to Australia’s energy security through the net zero transformation.

We know there is strong interest from business to work with the Government to make more critical energy hardware here including

high tech Australian start-ups, local fabricators and material suppliers, and international investors.

Community benefit principles – including for supply chains, diverse workforces and secure jobs – are central to Government

investment through Future Made In Australia.

The Solar Sunshot program reflects this intent and will encourage investment in the people, communities and regions that will drive

solar PV supply chains and the broader net zero transformation.

Quotes attributable to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese:

“I want a future made in Australia. And I want a future made in our regions. Places like the Hunter, Gladstone, Rockhampton and the

Spencer Gulf.

“Because Australia can do what other countries cannot. We have that combination of resources, skills, workers, space and sunlight to

co-locate those links in the value chain.

“Solar Sunshot is about building on those strong foundations, building resilience into Australia’s renewable energy supply chains,

and building a Future Made in Australia.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen:

“When it comes to powering Australia’s future nothing will beat our sun and our solar knowhow. That’s why bringing solar

manufacturing to our shores is so critical for unlocking our future as a renewable energy superpower and securing the job of the

future.

“Diverse, secure and resilient supply chains – supported by more onshore manufacturing across more of the value chain – are too

important to our security and success to leave to hope.

“Now is the time to take advantage of some of the best solar resources and renewable energy expertise in the world.

“Only the Albanese Government is backing businesses across the country to seize the opportunity of a Future Made in Australia,

powered by reliable renewables.”

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has opened the  rst

phase of the AUD 1 billion Solar Sunshot program aimed at advancing PV

manufacturing innovation in Australia and creating a more resilient

renewable energy supply chain.

ARENA Chief Executive O icer Darren Miller said the Solar Sunshot

program o ers production subsidies and grants to Australian businesses

and aims to uncover and support innovation to drive scale and diversity in

a critical industry.

“Solar electricity will be the foundation of Australia’s future energy supply

and the key to our net zero and renewable energy superpower ambitions,”

he said. “We need to build on our history of innovation and extend this

into manufacturing across the solar supply chain. The demand for solar

required to meet our net zero and renewable energy superpower goals is

immense and Australia has the opportunity to build resilience and unlock

long-term economic opportunity.”

The  rst AUD 550 million will support the commercialiuation of Australian

PV innovations and scale up the manufacturing of Australian solar panels.

This will include AUD 500 million in Round 1A to support solar panel

manufacturing in Australia, with a focus on modules, inputs to modules,

including solar glass and frames, and deployment systems like racking.

Round 1B will comprise AUD 50 million to fund solar panel manufacturing

studies, including feasibility and engineering studies.

Australian Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the Solar Sunshot

program will let Australian technology, innovation, know-how, and skills

compete against international players. He noted that only about 1% of the

solar panels installed in Australia are manufactured domestically.

“That’s why bringing solar manufacturing to our shores is so critical for

unlocking our future as a renewable energy superpower and securing the

job of the future,” he said. “Diverse, secure and resilient supply chains,

supported by more onshore manufacturing across more of the value chain,

are too important to our security and success to leave to hope. Now is the

time to take advantage of some of the best solar resources and renewable

energy expertise in the world.”

Heidi Lee, chief executive of independent think tank Beyond Zero

Emissions (BZE), said the Solar Sunshot initiative marks a signi cant step

toward building a robust and sustainable domestic solar industry, but

claimed that more needs to be done.

Lee said local content incentives within government contracts and

schemes are needed to provide demand certainty for Australian-made

clean tech, and to keep more of the bene ts of the initiative circulating in

our communities.

“China makes the lion’s share of the solar panels which go onto Australian

rooftops, and we can instead manufacture these parts and panels in

regions such as the Hunter, the Latrobe Valley, Illawarra and Central

Queensland,” she said. “These are all regions BZE has suggested can host

renewables-powered industrial and manufacturing hubs. These clean

industry hubs are the best investment locations for new manufacturing

facilities with existing infrastructure, transport logistics and skilled

workforces.”

The International Energy Agency estimates 1.300 manufacturing jobs for

each GW of solar PV production.

Applications for the  rst round of funding are now being taken with

ARENA saying proposals will be assessed against merit criteria on an

individual basis.  Applications for Round 1A are due by April 30, 2025.

while applications for Round 1B are to close on Nov. 12, 2025.

Future funding rounds under the Solar Sunshot program are expected to

be announced from mid-2025.
