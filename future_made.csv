"A Future Made in Australia 

This Budget invests $22.7 billion over the next 
decade to build a Future Made in Australia. This 
plan is about maximising the economic and 
industrial benefits of the move to net zero and 
securing Australia’s place in a changing global 
economic and strategic landscape. 

The global environment is changing rapidly. Supply 
chains are under pressure, with increasing 
fragmentation and intensifying global competition. 
New opportunities in clean energy industries are 
also emerging that will shape the future of the 
global economy over the next decade and beyond.  

Given our critical and abundant natural 
endowments and skilled workforce, Australia is 
well positioned to strengthen priority supply 
chains and become an indispensable part of the 
net zero global economy.  

The Government’s plan for a Future Made in 
Australia is central to this transformation. It is 
focused on encouraging and facilitating the private 
sector investment needed to make the most of 
this opportunity.  

The plan will help build a stronger, more 
diversified and more resilient economy powered 
by clean energy, in a way that creates secure, 
well-paid jobs and delivers benefits to 
communities across the country. 

The plan for a Future Made in Australia is about:  

•  Attracting and enabling investment  

•  Making Australia a renewable energy 

superpower 

•  Value adding to our resources and 
strengthening economic security 

•  Backing Australian ideas: innovation, 

digital, science 

• 

Investing in people and places 

As part of this plan, the Government will create 
a Future Made in Australia Act and establish a 
National Interest Framework to guide the 
identification of priority industries and prudent 
investments in the national interest. 

National Interest Framework  

The new National Interest Framework imposes 
rigour on Government’s decision making on 
significant public investments, particularly those 
used to incentivise private investment at scale. 

Through the Framework, priority industries will be 
identified under two streams. The ‘net zero 
transformation’ stream will identify industries that 
can make a significant contribution to achieving 
net zero, where Australia has grounds to build 
enduring comparative advantage. 

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
The ‘economic security and resilience’ stream will 
identify sectors that are critical to our resilience, 
are vulnerable to supply disruptions and that 
require support to unlock sufficient private 
investment. 

In the 2024–25 Budget, five industries are aligned 
with the National Interest Framework: 

•  Renewable hydrogen 

•  Critical minerals processing 

•  Green metals 

•  Low carbon liquid fuels 

•  Clean energy manufacturing, including battery 

and solar panel supply chains 

The Government will also apply community 
benefit principles to investments in priority 
industries, with a focus on investment in local 
communities, supply chains and skills, and 
promoting diverse workforces and secure jobs. 

This Budget invests significantly in these areas, 
through targeted support for early-stage 
innovation, financing, production and by 
improving investment enablers. 

In addition, Export Finance Australia’s National 
Interest Account will be expanded to allow 
support for projects where domestic capability is 
critical to protect our national security interests, 
strengthen resilience or ensure our nation is 
sufficiently resilient to shocks. Investments will be 
guided by the National Interest Framework. 

Given the pace of technological change, the 
Government will regularly review the list of 
priority industries against the National Interest 
Framework to ensure support remains fit for 
purpose in a changing world.  

Net zero transformation stream 

Renewable hydrogen 

Renewable hydrogen is a game changer, and the 
flagship of the net zero transformation stream. 
It opens the door to green metals, such as iron, 
steel, alumina and aluminium, and other 
applications critical to industrial decarbonisation. 

Our world class renewable energy resources make 
Australia well placed to produce green hydrogen 
at internationally competitive prices. Additionally, 
Australia is close to key markets, and our major 
trading partners have expressed a significant 
appetite for importing renewable hydrogen.  

Green Metals 

Significant quantities of green iron, steel, alumina 
and aluminium will be required to support the 
energy transition, globally and domestically. Both 
steel and aluminium are used in wind turbines, 
electric vehicles and grid infrastructure. However, 
traditional metals production is highly carbon 
intensive. Australia can develop a long-term 
comparative advantage in green metals by 
drawing on our abundant metal and renewable 
energy resources.  

Low carbon liquid fuels 

Sustainable aviation and diesel fuels will play a key 
role as the global and Australian economies 
transition to net zero, offering a decarbonisation 
pathway for many hard-to-abate sectors, including 
aviation, shipping and heavy transport. 

Australia’s large landmass, advanced farming 
practices, access to renewable feedstocks, 
established supply chains and renewable energy 
potential are all assets in developing domestic 
production of low carbon liquid fuels. 

Economic resilience and 
security stream  

Critical minerals  

Critical minerals are the building-blocks for a range 
of important sectors such as clean energy 
manufacturing, transport, agri-tech, medicine, 
defence, space, computing and 
telecommunications.  

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

2 

Under scenarios that achieve net zero emissions 
by 2050, global demand for critical minerals is 
expected to increase by around 350 per cent by 
2040. Australia is in a strong position to supply 
these minerals, with some of the world’s largest 
reserves of lithium, cobalt and rare earths. 

Refining and processing critical minerals here will 
allow us to move along global supply chains to 
capture more of the value and contribute to 
creating more diverse, resilient and sustainable 
global supply chains.  

Clean energy manufacturing 

Clean energy technologies are critical inputs to 
Australia’s energy transition. Global supply chains 
for certain clean energy technologies are highly 
concentrated, especially for solar panels and 
batteries. This increases Australia’s vulnerability to 
a disruption in supply, which could pose significant 
risks to Australia’s economic resilience.  

Along with other policy actions such as 
international partnerships and market facilitation, 
scaling-up Australia’s clean energy manufacturing 
will assist in strengthening our clean energy supply 
chains. 

Australia can contribute to the diversification of 
global solar and battery supply chains by 
harnessing our strengths in research and 
development, renewable energy and critical 
minerals, and investing in the areas of supply 
chains where we are most competitive.  

Strengthening our policy toolkit 

This Framework helps Government identify 
prudent investments in the national interest. 
It complements broader policy initiatives that 
boost productivity and economic growth. The 
Government will continue to apply other policy 
frameworks to promote Australia’s economic 
security and prosperity.  

For example, the Government will continue to 
invest in emerging critical technologies which 
create opportunities to transform a wide range of 
sectors across the economy. The Critical 
Technologies Statement prioritises action on 
artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, 
and quantum technologies among other fields.  

The Government will also continue to take direct 
action to build domestic industrial capacity for key 
defence technologies and capabilities, and support 
broader industrial priorities, including the priority 
areas of the National Reconstruction Fund. 

Attracting and enabling 
investment  

The Government is reforming investment settings, 
institutions and regulatory processes to attract 
and enable the investment Australia needs. 

New front door for investors  

The Government will establish a new front door 
for investors with major, transformational 
investment proposals related to the Government’s 
Future Made in Australia agenda to make it 
simpler to invest in Australia and attract more 
global and domestic capital. The front door will:  

•  provide a single point of contact for investors 

and companies with major investment 
proposals, 

•  deliver a joined-up approach to investment 

attraction and facilitation,  

• 

identify priority projects related to the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia 
agenda, 

•  support accelerated and coordinated approval 

decisions, and,  

•  connect investors with the Government’s 

specialist investment vehicles.  

The front door will complement and leverage 
existing institutions, including the Net Zero 
Economy Authority. The final approach to 
delivering an effective front door will be 
developed in consultation with investors, 

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

3 

businesses, governments, unions, communities, 
and other experts over the course of 2024.  

These initiatives complement the Government’s 
climate disclosure legislation and the forthcoming 
issuance of $7 billion in green bonds in 2023–24. 

Strengthening and streamlining approvals 

The Government is making it easier to invest in 
transformational projects by streamlining approval 
processes in ways that strengthen standards.  

The Government is providing $134.2 million to 
better prioritise approvals for renewable energy 
projects of national significance, and support 
faster decisions on environment, cultural heritage 
and planning approvals. This investment delivers 
more support for assessments across approval 
processes so we can reduce delays for projects 
and provide greater certainty for businesses.  

The Government is also committing $20.7 million 
to improve engagement with communities 
involved in the energy transition and accelerate 
the delivery of key energy projects, through a 
bolstered Australian Energy Infrastructure 
Commissioner and voluntary national developer 
standards. This will complement initiatives with 
states and territories to improve planning and 
energy grid connection approval processes. 

To further encourage investment, the Government 
will provide $15.7 million to deliver a stronger, 
more streamlined, and more transparent approach 
to foreign investment. This will ensure that 
Australia can attract the significant foreign capital 
flows we need, while protecting the national 
interest in an increasingly complex economic 
and geostrategic environment. 

Promoting sustainable finance 

The Government is committing $17.3 million to 
implement a comprehensive agenda to mobilise 
private investment in sustainable activities.  

The Budget provides funding to extend Australia’s 
sustainable finance taxonomy to the agriculture 
sector and develop an investment product 
labelling regime for financial products marketed as 
sustainable. Additionally, the Government will 
explore data quality improvements and provide 
$1.3 million to develop and release best practice 
guidance for disclosing net zero transition plans.  

Making Australia a renewable 
energy superpower 

Australia’s ambition to become a renewable 
energy superpower is foundational to the 
Government’s broader plan for a future made in 
Australia. The Government is taking decisive steps 
to promote private investment in priority 
industries by supporting innovation, financing 
and production. 

Innovation 

The Government is investing $3.2 billion over the 
next decade through the Australian Renewable 
Energy Agency to support the commercialisation 
of technologies that are critical to the net zero 
transformation. The new $1.7 billion Future Made 
in Australia Innovation Fund will fund the 
deployment of innovative technologies and 
facilities linked directly to priority industries, 
including green metals and low carbon liquid fuels. 

Financing 

The Government will work with the 
Commonwealth’s specialist investment vehicles, 
including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
and the National Reconstruction Fund, to ensure 
coordinated investment on critical government 
priorities. Investments from these entities can help 
reduce barriers to investment by de-risking 
projects and reducing upfront capital costs.  

Production 

This Budget includes targeted production 
incentives to scale up priority industries: aligning 
incentives to invest with the national interest, 
targeting ‘green premiums’ that are not yet 
reflected in market prices, and investing efficiently 
in mitigating the risks of excess supply chain 
concentration.  

Support for production is being delivered over 
timeframes that promote accelerated investment 

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

4 

over the next decade, and in ways that are 
contingent on successful production. 

The Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive will 
provide a $2 incentive per kilogram of renewable 
hydrogen produced for up to ten years per project, 
between 2027–28 and 2039–40 for projects that 
reach final investment decisions by 2030. This will 
operate alongside the expanded Hydrogen 
Headstart program, which supports the early 
movers investing in the industry’s development in 
a way that complements the support provided 
through the tax system.  

Details of these programs are subject to 
consultation, alongside proposals to provide 
further incentives to support efficient production 
of green metals and low carbon liquid fuels. 

Guarantee of origin 

The Government is making it easier for businesses 
and trading partners to source low-emissions 
products by building better markets and product 
standards for green products.  

The Guarantee of Origin scheme will measure and 
certify the emissions intensity across the supply 
chain of key products. The Budget provides 
$32.2 million to fast-track the initial phase of this 
scheme, focused on renewable hydrogen, and 
support the expansion of the program to green 
meals and low carbon liquid fuels. 

Cheaper, cleaner energy  

Delivering on Australia’s potential to produce 
abundant renewable energy is essential to 
realising the industrial opportunities associated 
with cheaper, cleaner energy.  

The Government will unlock over $65 billion of 
renewable energy capacity through the Capacity 
Investment Scheme. This investment will translate 
Australia’s natural advantages into reality and 
transform the electricity grid for an economy 
powered by renewables.  

This Budget also helps Australians benefit from 
cheaper, cleaner energy sooner by committing 
$27.7 million to better integrate consumer energy 
resources, such as rooftop solar, household 
batteries and electric vehicles, into the grid.  

Securing the net zero transformation 

The Government is developing six sector plans 
covering electricity and energy, transport, 
industry, resources, agriculture and land, and the 
built environment. The sector plans will guide 
decarbonisation efforts and outline the role of 
each sector in supporting Australia’s transition 
to net zero. 

This Budget continues the Government’s 
investment in emissions abatement, including 
$63.8 million to reduce emissions in the 
agriculture and land sector. 

Value adding to resources and 
strengthening economic security 

The Budget boosts economic resilience and 
security including by shoring up and diversifying 
supply chains. It does this by value-adding to our 
resources, investing in critical minerals projects, 
supporting clean energy manufacturing and 
advancing trade initiatives.  

The Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive will 
provide a production incentive valued at 
10 per cent of relevant processing and refining 
costs for Australia’s 31 critical minerals. This 
incentive will be applicable for up to 10 years per 
project, for production between 2027–28 and 
2039–40 by projects that reach final investment 
decisions by 2030.  

The Government is also investing in priority critical 
minerals projects, including through the Critical 
Minerals Facility and the Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Facility. This will complement the 
Critical Minerals National Productivity Initiative 
which provides $10 million to work in partnership 
with states and territories to develop 
pre-feasibility studies of common-user 
infrastructure, which promotes a competitive 
and productive critical minerals sector. 

The Government is making targeted investments 
in clean energy technology manufacturing 
capabilities, focused on the aspects of highly 
concentrated critical energy supply chains that 
best align with Australia’s comparative advantages 
and capabilities. This includes the $1 billion Solar

the clean energy workforce through expanded 
access to the New Energy Apprenticeship Program 
and investments in VET clean energy courses. 

This Budget also expands support for women 
training in male-dominated industries through 
$55.6 million for the Building Women’s Careers 
program and $38.2 million to support diversity in 
science, technology, engineering, and maths. 

This is part of the Government’s targeted 
approach to meeting skills needed for a Future 
Made in Australia, including $68.4 million to 
attract and retain the skilled industrial workforce 
needed to support defence industrial priorities. 

Investing in places 

The Government is investing in the regions that 
have traditionally powered Australia to realise the 
benefits of the net zero transformation.  

This Budget provides $209.3 million to expand the 
Net Zero Economy Authority, and catalyse private 
and public investment, and support workers 
affected by the transition.  

It also invests $178.6 million in worker transition 
support, including the Energy Industry Jobs Plan 
and place-based Regional Workforce Transition 
Plans which will reflect the voices of communities, 
workers and employers.  

Sunshot and $523.2 million in support for the 
Battery Breakthrough Initiative. 

To support the delivery of the 82 per cent 
renewable energy target, the Government has 
formed the National Renewable Energy Supply 
Chain Action Plan with states and territories which 
will strengthen supply chains of key inputs 
required for clean energy. 

The Government is also progressing trade 
initiatives to address global market competition 
and support critical minerals trade enhancement.  

Backing Australian ideas – 
innovation, digital and science 

Modern science, innovation and investments in 
technology will be critical to maximising the 
opportunities of a changing global economic and 
strategic landscape, including the net zero 
transformation. 

Building on Australia’s existing strengths in 
research and applied technology, the Government 
is investing $466.4 million to build quantum 
computing capabilities, in partnership with the 
Queensland Government and PsiQuantum. 

The Government is also investing $566 million in 
open science by supporting Geoscience Australia 
to map Australia’s endowments of critical minerals 
and national groundwater systems. 

To grow our core science and innovation 
capability, the Government will undertake a 
strategic examination of Australia’s research and 
development (R&D) system. 

Investing in people and places 

Investing in people and places is central to the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia plan. This 
Budget makes important investments in skills, 
training and education and provides support for 
communities and regions that are most impacted 
by the net zero transformation.  

Investing in people 

The Government is investing $91.0 million over the 
next five years to accelerate the development of

Executive Summary 
The strong fundamentals that have underpinned Australia’s past economic success will continue 
to be fundamental to Australia’s competitiveness. However, the net zero transition and 
heightened geostrategic competition are transforming the global economy. These factors are 
changing the value of countries’ natural endowments, disrupting trade patterns, creating new 
markets, requiring heightened adaptability and rewarding innovation. 

Australia’s comparative advantages, capabilities and trade partnerships mean that these global 
shifts present profound opportunity for Australian workers and businesses. Our abundant 
natural assets and resource endowments create significant opportunities to foster new globally 
competitive industries that can boost our economic prosperity and resilience, while supporting 
decarbonisation. When combined with Australia’s strong trade partnerships, fair and 
competitive markets and commitment to open trade and international investment, this will help 
make Australia an indispensable part of global supply chains. 

The Future Made in Australia agenda takes steps to foster and encourage the significant private 
sector investment into priority industries necessary to harness these opportunities and ensure 
our future prosperity. In certain circumstances, targeted public investment can strengthen the 
alignment of economic incentives with Australia’s national interests and crowding-in private 
investment at scale to develop priority industries.  

In considering the prudent basis for public investment, the following factors have been 
considered: Australia’s grounds for lasting competitiveness, the role the industry will play in 
securing an orderly path to net zero and in building Australia’s economic resilience and security, 
whether the industry will build key capabilities, and whether the barriers to private investment 
can be resolved through public investment in a way that delivers compelling public value.  

These tests have informed the development of a National Interest Framework structured 
around two streams:  

•  The Net Zero Transformation Stream will include industries that will make a significant 

contribution to the net zero transition and are expected to have an enduring comparative 
advantage, and public investment is needed for the sector to make a significant contribution 
to emissions reduction at an efficient cost.  

•  The Economic Resilience and Security Stream will include industries where some level of 
domestic capability is necessary or efficient to deliver adequate economic resilience and 
security, and the private sector would not invest in this capability in the absence of public 
investment. 

The Government will also apply Community Benefit Principles in relation to investments in 
priority industries. These principles will have a focus on investment in local communities, supply 
chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and secure jobs. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  1 

 
 
This paper outlines the National Interest Framework that provides rigour to Government 
decisions on significant public investments in industry on the basis of the national interest, 
particularly when they are used to incentivise private investment at scale. In this way, this 
Framework complements existing Government investment processes and policy frameworks, 
adding rigour to relevant policy assessments without replacing complementary processes. 

To demonstrate its application, the paper also applies the Framework to the Government’s plan 
to make Australia a Renewable Energy Superpower, providing a point in time assessment of 
how renewable hydrogen, green metals, low-carbon liquid fuels, processing and refining of 
critical minerals and manufacturing of clean energy technologies align with the principles 
identified in this Framework. The findings of this assessment support the meaningful but 
targeted incentives for private investment included in the 2024–25 Budget Future Made in 
Australia package.  

The Future Made in Australia package also includes broader investments in the Government’s 
growth agenda, including critical technologies, defence priorities, skills in priority sectors, 
a competitive business environment and reforms to better attract and deploy investment. 
Treasury will be responsible for the operation of the Framework and further details will be 
made available and consulted on as part of the Future Made in Australia legislative package. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  2 

 
 
 
 
A Future Made in Australia 
The Government’s 2023 Intergenerational Report identified five domestic and global forces that 
will continue to shape the trajectory and composition of Australia’s economic growth over the 
next 40 years: population ageing; the rising demand for care and support services; technological 
and digital transformation; climate change and the net zero transformation; and geopolitical 
risk and fragmentation. The Government is acting across a range of fronts to respond to these 
forces and ensure our future prosperity, including through employment and industry policy. 

Investing in modernising and diversifying Australia’s industrial base is a core part of the 
Government’s plan to make Australians the beneficiaries of the changing global economic and 
strategic landscape. The 2023 Employment White Paper outlined how coordinated industry and 
regional policy, combined with a strong enabling environment, policy certainty and leadership, 
can deliver a dynamic and inclusive labour market. 

The Future Made in Australia package in the 2024–25 Budget delivers on this priority by 
attracting and enabling investment, making Australia a Renewable Energy Superpower, value 
adding to our resources and strengthening economic security, backing Australian ideas and 
investing in people and places. This includes targeted public investment to strengthen the 
alignment of economic incentives with Australia’s national interests and incentivise private 
investment at scale to develop priority industries.  

Achieving the global net zero transformation is a critical imperative. Policy decisions are needed 
to allow markets to internalise the negative externalities from emissions, drive efficient 
decarbonisation, spur long-term investment in clean, emissions-lowering technologies and 
industries, and seize the economic opportunities this transformation presents. This is a critical 
environmental challenge, but also provides a significant opportunity to attract private 
investment and ensure Australia becomes a more productive and competitive economy, by 
capitalising on our existing and emerging strengths and comparative advantages.  

Intensifying strategic competition and rising geopolitical risks, combined with recent events 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic and recent conflicts around the world, have heightened the 
focus on economic resilience and security in most nations. This has been met with a renewal 
of industrial policies in many major economies. As a medium-sized open economy, Australia’s 
economic prosperity is linked to the fortunes of the global economy, which is becoming 
increasingly fragmented. Strengthening critical global and domestic supply chains, including 
in some cases through a higher degree of domestic capability, will help to respond to these 
changes and improve our long-term economic security.  

In navigating these structural changes in the global economy, Australia will continue to benefit 
from the strong foundations and institutions that have supported the strength and resilience of 
our economy over recent decades. Since the mid-1980s, predictable macroeconomic policy and 
an ongoing focus on fiscal sustainability have supported strong and sustainable growth, with 
low inflation and low unemployment. Microeconomic reforms that have promoted healthy 
competition and a strong commitment to free trade have lowered costs for households and 
business, provided access to global goods and services, and driven productivity improvements.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  3 

 
 
Australia has clear advantages 
Australia is ideally placed to benefit from the global transitions underway, given our unique 
combination of strengths covering access to renewable energy sources, resources, research and 
development, human capital and strong international partnerships. 

Our abundant natural assets and resource endowments create significant opportunities to 
foster new globally competitive industries that can boost our economic prosperity 
while supporting both domestic and global decarbonisation. In particular, our vast renewable 
energy potential provides the basis for sustained comparative advantage in new 
clean-energy-intensive industries. 

Transforming Australia’s electricity grid to one powered by low-cost renewable energy is 
a pre-requisite for capitalising on Australia’s comparative advantage in producing cleaner, 
cheaper energy. The Government’s Capacity Investment Scheme is unlocking more than 
$65 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation and clean dispatchable 
capacity, helping to deliver the Government’s target of an 82 per cent renewable electricity grid 
by 2030. 

Australia is home to some of the world’s largest reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, 
cobalt and rare earths needed to diversify supply chains and support low emissions 
technologies. The global demand for critical minerals will need to increase by around 
350 per cent by 2040 as the world progresses towards its net zero commitments.i Australia is 
already the world’s largest producer of lithium and is well placed to meet future global demand, 
with exports projected to double over the next five years.ii   

Australia has the ability to leverage its track record as a trusted and reliable trade partner, with 
established links into key markets in North Asia, the United States and Europe, to be a reliable 
supplier into the growing markets of the future. Australia has been a strong advocate and 
champion of the multilateral trading system and a rules-based approach. We will continue to 
actively engage in the relevant international fora to uphold existing rules and develop new rules 
to address contemporary challenges.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  4 

 
 
 
 
Role for government 
The private sector is responding to these major structural changes and harnessing these 
new opportunities. In many instances, businesses and investors possess the skills, market 
information, risk-taking frameworks, agility and flexibility to make the necessary and 
appropriate long-term investments in new markets and technologies. However, there are also 
circumstances where economic incentives are not aligned with broader national interest 
objectives.  

Government plays an important role to create a positive investment and enabling environment 
in which businesses can take appropriate risks. This needs to be partnered with rigorous 
assessment of where there may be a case for public investment to incentivise private 
investment at scale in the national interest. 

Given the major forces shaping our external environment, more direct government 
interventions may be justified where particular market failures are present, such as:  

•  Where the negative externalities from more emissions-intensive production methods are not 

appropriately priced into global markets, so cleaner production methods that present 
cost effective abatement opportunities are not able to compete on a level playing field with 
existing industry. This ‘green premium’ will lead to an undersupply of products drawing on 
cleaner production methods. 

•  Where private firms fail to appropriately price in the required level of economic resilience 
and security in critical sectors and supply chains, resulting in unacceptable levels of risk to 
Australia’s national interest or broader economy.  

•  When technologies that are critical to the net zero transformation or broader national 

interest are nascent, and public investment in innovation can generate important learnings 
that help those that come later to produce at a lower cost. These learnings represent 
a positive externality that early movers cannot internalise in their decision making. Given the 
presence of positive externalities, without government support, there will be an 
underinvestment in cleaner production methods, which slows down the learning-by-doing 
process and prolongs the use of more emissions-intensive production processes.  

Deliberate and targeted policy actions to improve the investment climate and address market 
failures will help the private sector to navigate the risks and challenges posed by changes to the 
global landscape and build a stronger and more resilient Australian economy for the future.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  5 

 
 
 
 
A National Interest Framework  
The Government has committed to introduce a Future Made in Australia Act (the Act) that 
promotes and facilitates investment in the public interest. The Act will include a new National 
Interest Framework (the Framework) that clearly articulates how priority sectors will be 
identified. The Framework will be used to impose rigour on Government’s decision making on 
significant public investments, particularly those used to incentivise private investment at scale. 

In considering the prudent basis for public investment, the following factors have been 
considered: Australia’s grounds for lasting competitiveness, the role the industry will play in 
securing an orderly path to net zero, the role the industry will play in building Australia’s 
economic resilience and security, whether the industry will build key capabilities, and whether 
the barriers to private investment can be resolved through public investment in a way that 
delivers compelling public value.  

These five tests have informed the development of the Framework, which provides practical 
principles for identifying priority industries under two streams and guidance for assessing public 
support. Given that technology and global markets will continue to evolve rapidly, sectors 
prioritised under the Framework will be reviewed regularly.  

The Government will consult on the details of this Framework as part of the consultation on the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia legislative package. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  6 

 
 
 
 
The National Interest Framework 

Identifying priority industries in the national interest:  

There are two streams under which an industry may warrant Government intervention to 
attract private investment at scale.  

The Net Zero Transformation Stream will identify priority sectors where: 

•  Australian industry is expected to have a sustained comparative advantage in a net zero 

global economy; and   

•  Public investment is needed for the sector to make a significant contribution to 

emissions reduction at an efficient cost.  

An industry is more likely to qualify for support under this stream if the industry:  

• 

is energy-intensive and capable of substantially reducing its carbon emissions by taking 
advantage of our abundant renewable energy resources;   

•  has output that embodies low carbon emissions and can help contribute to 

decarbonisation in other areas of the economy;  

•  can leverage Australia’s highly skilled workforce, using technological improvements to 

reduce labour intensity;  
is able to achieve economies of scale in Australia; and 

• 
•  aligns with our international trading partners’ current or future needs and is 

complementary to actions taken by our strategic partners. 

The Economic Resilience and Security Stream will identify priority sectors where: 

•  some level of domestic capability is a necessary or efficient way to protect the 

economic resilience and security of Australia, and the private sector will not deliver the 
necessary investment in the absence of government support. 

Consideration under this stream will include factors such as:  

•  The global and domestic concentration of supply and supply chains;  
•  The vulnerability of supply to disruption; 
•  How critical the industry or product is to our security and resilience; and  
•  Whether the industry can prevent, absorb, adapt or transform processes to limit the 

consequences of a shock to our national interests.

The National Interest Framework (continued) 

Policy approach 

In certain circumstances, targeted public investment can strengthen the alignment of 
economic incentives with Australia’s national interests, and incentivise private investment 
at scale to develop priority industries. Common barriers to investment include:  

•  The failure of markets to price in externalities, such as emissions from production, and 

positive externalities from learnings generated by early movers; 

•  Non-financial barriers, such as uncertainty about approval processes, access to skilled 

labour and a lack of enabling regulation (i.e. certification and standards); and  

•  Financial barriers such as high up-front capital costs, requiring concessional financing, 

or the cost difference between a low emissions product and its incumbent 
emissions-intensive competitor, requiring temporary production support.  

Under both streams, the Framework recommends considering how industry-led solutions, 
trade partnerships, regulatory approaches, or supply agreements could be used to 
efficiently align these incentives. Government should consider whether the barriers to 
private investment can be resolved through public investment in a way that delivers 
compelling public value, relative to these complementary approaches.  

Public support should be designed in a way that complements Australia’s strategic 
partnerships and should be consistent with Australia’s obligations under its bilateral and 
multilateral trade agreements.  

Community benefit principles 

The Government will apply community benefit principles in relation to investments in 
priority industries. These principles will have a focus on building capability through 
investment in local communities, supply chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse 
workforces and secure jobs.

Net Zero Transformation Stream 
As outlined in the previous section, the Net Zero Transformation Stream of the National Interest 
Framework will be used to identify sectors assessed to have grounds for sustained comparative 
advantage in a net zero global economy, and public investment is needed for the sector to make 
a significant contribution to emissions reduction at an efficient cost. 

In a world of intensifying global competition for clean energy industries, Australia is expected to 
have several areas of comparative advantage. These include: 

•  An abundance of low-cost bulk renewable energy capacity;  

•  Access to, and abundance of, critical inputs and bulk raw materials; 

•  Existing strengths in research and development;  

•  Access to deep capital markets, low sovereign risk and a stable political environment; and  

•  Proximity to fast growing Indo-Pacific markets and a strong track record as a reliable and 

trusted exporter of energy and resources. 

Australia is more likely to be globally competitive without long-run support if the industry:  

• 

is energy-intensive and capable of substantially reducing its carbon emissions by taking 
advantage of our abundant renewable energy resources;   

•  has output that embodies low carbon emissions and can help contribute to decarbonisation 

in other areas of the economy;  

•  can leverage Australia’s highly skilled workforce, using technological improvements to 

reduce labour intensity;  

• 

is able to achieve economies of scale in Australia; and 

•  aligns with our international trading partners’ current or future needs and is complementary 

to actions taken by our strategic partners. 

Over time, the development of market mechanisms here and overseas are expected to increase 
demand for low- or zero-emissions goods and production methods, reducing barriers to 
investment in these sectors. Examples of where the Government has contributed to the 
development of market mechanisms in Australia include the Safeguard Mechanism, New 
Vehicle Efficiency Standards and the Guarantee of Origin scheme which accredits and certifies 
the emissions content of key industrial goods. The Government’s Sustainable Finance Strategy is 
also supporting the maturation of markets for sustainable products through improving disclosure 
of climate risks and opportunities, and enabling better labelling of sustainable finance products.

Energy Intensity: Australia’s Comparative Advantage 

Australia has a comparative advantage in the production of decarbonised energy intensive 
goods due to our abundant, low-cost renewable resources, particularly wind and solar. 
This is expected to support globally competitive renewable electricity prices as the world 
transitions to net zero. This reflects a range of factors including declining capital costs, 
ongoing technological improvement in solar and wind generation and storage, and 
abundant solar and wind resources that enable scale and better capacity utilisation.

Energy Intensity: Australia’s Comparative Advantage (continued) 

One example of where Australia is expected to have a comparative advantage because of 
our abundant sources of renewable energy and our endowments of raw materials is green 
iron for steel production. Steel production is currently responsible for around 10 per cent 
of global emissions because it uses coking coal for both the chemical reaction to strip 
oxygen from iron ore and to generate the heat needed to produce molten iron and turn 
iron into steel.iv  

Steel production can be decarbonised using zero-emission hydrogen for both the heat and 
the chemical reaction in the iron-making process, and renewable electricity to power 
steelmaking in an electric arc furnace. However, it can be challenging to transport 
hydrogen, making it more economic to produce green iron close to where hydrogen can 
be produced (further detail in Priority Sectors, Green Metals). 

The appropriate nature, scale and duration of support for emerging Net Zero Transformation 
Stream priority industries will depend on the maturity of the low- or zero-emissions technology 
available to the industry, the specific barriers to private sector investment and the expected 
contribution to domestic and global decarbonisation.  

For very nascent technology, research and development grants and support for demonstration 
or pilot projects may be the most appropriate way to support the sector, to help accelerate 
learning by doing and incentivise private companies to invest efficiently in innovation and 
diffusion activities that have significant public benefit.  

For more mature technologies, the barriers to private investment are more likely to include 
uncertainty around project approval processes and financial barriers, which may include: 

•  high upfront capital costs to install or retrofit zero emissions facilities, which are difficult to 

commit to given highly uncertain policy and technology pathways; and 

•  the cost differential between low-emissions products and incumbent emissions-intensive 

competitors (where markets are not pricing in the externalities from emissions). 

In these circumstances, capital grants and different forms of concessional finance may be 
appropriate to help overcome upfront capital cost barriers, while direct production support may 
be more appropriate to temporarily bridge the gap (or ‘green premium’) between low emissions 
products and incumbent competitors. These measures can help to de-risk priority projects and 
improve rates of return for investors, crowding in private investment.  

Policy support for industries identified under the Net Zero Transformation Stream should 
generally be time-limited, encourage early-movers and bridge the gap until an appropriate 
market signal is established or until the green premium in cleaner production costs shrinks. 
Over time, barriers to investment are likely to decline as certainty improves around global 
emissions reduction pathways and early-stage projects provide critical learnings for future 
investors. Providing temporary support will drive earlier decarbonisation activity within 
Australia while maintaining the international competitiveness of Australian companies. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  11 

 
 
 
Economic Resilience and Security Stream 
The Economic Resilience and Security Stream includes sectors where some level of domestic 
capability is necessary or efficient to deliver adequate economic resilience and security, and the 
private sector would not invest in this capability in the absence of public investment.  

To qualify under this stream, a shock or disruption to supply in the relevant sector would need 
to have unacceptably high impacts on safety, national security, economic stability or wellbeing 
in the absence of sufficient domestic capability and capacity. The importance of ensuring access 
to supply can also be considered for emerging sectors. To assess the materiality of these risks, 
consideration will be given to the following factors, among others:  

•  The global and domestic concentration of supply;  

•  The vulnerability of supply to disruption or other barriers to access; 

•  How critical the sector or product is to our security and resilience; and  

•  Whether the industry can prevent, absorb, adapt or transform processes to limit the 

consequences of a shock to our national interests.  

The Government regularly undertakes comprehensive scans of the economy to identify 
products and sectors that are both critical for economic resilience or security and face an 
elevated risk of disruption from international and domestic shocks. Some risk events, such as 
a disruption or shortage of non-critical goods or services, will have a relatively low impact, while 
other shocks may have an unacceptably high impact. Assessing the ability of the private sector 
to respond to potential supply disruptions requires data-led supply chain mapping and 
consultation across Government and with relevant industries to determine the capability of 
business to:  

•  Pre-emptively diversify its suppliers and develop stronger business-to-business links;  

•  Absorb or adapt to disruptions, such as through accessing alternative suppliers; and/or  

•  Transform production processes during disruptions. 

Where substantial risks to the national interest remain, a range of targeted responses – from 
‘light-touch no-regrets’ actions through to direct government intervention – can be considered 
to manage unacceptable residual risks at least cost. Industry-led solutions, hedging through 
financial market instruments, government-to-government supply agreements with strategic 
partners, or regulation, should be prioritised. Where these are not sufficient or appropriate to 
address risks to economic security and economic resilience, public investment should be 
considered if it can deliver compelling public value.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  12 

 
 
 
 
The enabling environment 
Building a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy powered by clean energy will 
require Australia to attract significant private sector investment and establish an environment 
that supports new businesses to grow and new industries to develop lasting sources of 
competitiveness. The Government is focused on promoting a competitive and dynamic 
economy, supported by the National Competition Review, delivery of the Government’s 
five-pillar productivity agenda, and investment in a skilled and adaptable workforce, as outlined 
in the Employment White Paper policy roadmap. 

As part of the Future Made in Australia agenda, the Government is taking further steps to 
attract and facilitate investment, including establishing a new front door to facilitate private 
investment. This new front door will support investors with major transformational investment 
proposals by:  

•  providing a single point of contact for investors and companies with major investment 

proposals, 

•  delivering a joined-up approach to investment attraction and facilitation, 

• 

identifying priority projects related to the Government’s Future Made in Australia agenda, 

•  supporting strengthened and streamlined approvals decisions, and, 

•  connecting investors with the Government’s specialist investment vehicles. 

The Government is also streamlining approval processes in ways that strengthen standards. 
Through smarter use of data, better decision-making processes and appropriate resourcing, 
the Government is delivering faster pathways to better decisions on environmental, energy, 
planning, cultural heritage and foreign investment approvals. This will help to facilitate 
development of nationally significant projects in priority sectors, while also balancing protection 
of our environmental and cultural heritage.  

The Government is putting in place the financial system architecture necessary to ensure 
Australia can mobilise private capital towards the transition to net zero. Building on actions 
including mandating climate disclosure and issuing sovereign green bonds, the 2024–25 Budget 
funds the development of an investment product labelling regime, extension of the sustainable 
finance taxonomy to the agricultural sector and the development of best practice transition 
plan guidance for businesses. 

Continued collaboration across the Government’s special investment vehicles will crowd-in 
private investment in projects that are in the national interest, including through the 
National Reconstruction Fund. As part of the Future Made in Australia package, the 
Government will expand the scope of the National Interest Account to provide additional 
avenues for financing projects in the national interest, leveraging the investment expertise of 
Export Finance Australia. 

These initiatives complement foundational investments in Australia’s net zero transformation 
and strong trade partnerships in a changing international environment. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  13 

 
 
 
Other complementary frameworks 
The Government will continue to apply other industry policy and national resilience frameworks 
to complement the Framework and shape our future security and prosperity.  

For example, the Government will continue to invest in emerging critical technologies which 
will create opportunities to transform a wide range of sectors across the economy. In the 
Critical Technologies Statement, the Government has prioritised action on AI, robotics and 
automation and quantum technologies among other fields. The Government applies an 
integrated national interest model to evaluate economic security, national security and social 
cohesion implications and makes targeted interventions when required. This ensures that 
Australia’s development of, access to and choices in technologies are secure, reliable and cost 
effective. The Government’s recent investments in quantum computing are an example of this 
approach in action.  

The Government has chosen to invest directly to build domestic industrial capacity for key 
defence technologies and capabilities. Australia’s defence industry plays an integral part in the 
whole-of-nation preparedness uplift in response to the complex strategic circumstances we 
face. A capable, resilient, competitive and innovative sovereign defence industrial base is an 
important element, even though Australia’s defence industrial base will never be completely 
self-reliant. The recently announced 2024 National Defence Strategy outlines the Government’s 
approach to national defence, and the accompanying Integrated Investment Program sets out 
the specific capabilities the Government will invest in to give effect to the Strategy. The 
Sovereign Defence Industrial Priorities in the Defence Industry Development Strategy will also 
support industry’s ability to deliver Australian Defence Force priorities and contribute to 
broader industry and workforce resilience. 

The Government will also continue to provide programs and support to other sectors to achieve 
specific government priorities and objectives, such as through the Government’s National 
Reconstruction Fund or the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.  

Community Benefit Principles 
In addition to the Framework, the Future Made in Australia Act will outline Community Benefit 
Principles for decision makers to apply when designing policies or considering investment 
decisions that are designed to promote private investment at scale in industries aligned with the 
National Interest. These principles will have a focus on investment in local communities, supply 
chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and secure jobs. They will be applied 
in ways that promote private investment that builds sustainable industries by broadening 
opportunity, investing in future workforce, and strengthening supporting supply chains, without 
limiting the competitiveness of emerging industries.  

The Government will consult on the details of these Principles as part of the consultation on the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia legislative package. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  14 

 
 
 
 
Priority sectors  
Initial work conducted across government as part of the Government’s plan to become 
a Renewable Energy Superpower identified a number of priority industries that align with the 
principles included in the National Interest Framework, under either the Net Zero 
Transformation or Economic Resilience and Security streams.  

These assessments illustrate how the National Interest Framework can inform consideration of 
where public investment may be required to strengthen the alignment of economic incentives 
with Australia’s national interests. In particular, they have contributed to Government 
consideration of whether public support is warranted to incentivise private investment at scale 
in these industries, and the most appropriate policy approaches to do so.  

Assessments have been made at a point in time and are subject to review as policy 
circumstances and market conditions evolve. Consistent with the purpose of the National 
Interest Framework, they are not intended to inform all government decisions or replace other 
policy frameworks. Treasury will consult on the details of this framework as part of the 
consultation on the Government’s Future Made in Australia legislative package.  

Net Zero Transformation Stream  

Renewable hydrogen 

There is a strong case for including renewable hydrogen as a priority industry under the 
Net Zero Transformation Stream. Most notably, it:  

• 

is highly energy intensive and can take advantage of our abundant renewable resources;  

•  can make a major contribution to decarbonisation in other areas of the economy; and  

• 

it aligns with our international trading partners current and future needs.  

Contribution to net zero 

Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in the net zero transformation as it can be produced in 
ways that have limited or no emissions and replace emissions-intensive fuels in other processes. 

Hydrogen is a flexible fuel, which is transportable and storable to varying degrees depending on 
the derivative. It can be used for high-temperature industrial processes and is a key feedstock 
for producing chemicals with diverse uses such as ammonia and methanol. When used as a fuel, 
the only by-product is water and there are no carbon emissions at that point.  

Renewable hydrogen is truly a zero or low-emissions fuel that can be produced at a commercial 
scale through electrolysis, which extracts hydrogen from water using electricity. If renewable 
electricity is used, this process produces no carbon emissions, and is known as either ‘green’ or 
‘renewable hydrogen’. Most hydrogen today is made using either gas (via steam methane 
reforming) or, less commonly, coal (via gasification). These processes are carbon intensive, but 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  15 

 
 
if the associated emissions are successfully captured and stored, this is called ‘blue’ or 
‘low-emissions hydrogen’, with more emissions than renewable hydrogen. 

Beyond decarbonising existing uses of hydrogen in the economy, such as in producing 
ammonia, renewable hydrogen is an enabler of green manufacturing, with the potential 
to underpin green commodity production in a range of sectors, particularly where 
electrification is not an option. This could include decarbonising fertilisers, opening up 
value-added export industries such as green iron, and as an input to emerging types of Low 
Carbon Liquid Fuel (LCLF).  

Key trading partners, such as Europe, India, Japan and the Republic of Korea see hydrogen as 
a critical part of their transition to net zero, making exports of Australian renewable hydrogen 
an important opportunity for facilitating global decarbonisation. The costs of transporting, 
converting and storing hydrogen and its derivatives are currently high relative to unabated fossil 
fuels. However, this is exacerbated by distance, which means that Australia may be 
a competitive source of supply for key trading partners such as Japan in the future (Chart 2). 
It is in Australia’s interests to position adaptively for a range of hydrogen-adjacent 
opportunities besides hydrogen export – for example, using hydrogen as a feedstock in 
clean-energy embodied goods, such as green iron, as a practical way to embed hydrogen in 
energy-intensive goods.

Comparative advantage 

Australia holds several key advantages that suggest that we will have a comparative advantage 
in producing renewable hydrogen. Principally, Australia has world class renewable energy 
resources at prices that should be internationally competitive (Chart 1). This provides Australian 
producers an advantage because energy costs make up more than half the cost of producing 
hydrogen using present-day electrolyser technology.  

There are costs involved in both storing and transporting hydrogen. While this presents 
challenges for exporting renewable hydrogen, using hydrogen where you make it avoids many 
of these costs. It may be more competitive to directly supply renewable hydrogen embodied 
products, like green metals and ammonia that other countries need but cannot produce as cost 
competitively as Australia. An adaptive National Hydrogen Strategy will allow Australia to 
position for a portfolio of opportunities depending on how markets and technologies develop. 

Our long history as a reliable and trusted energy exporter will be attractive for foreign 
investment and some of our closest trading partners have announced significant use and import 
targets for hydrogen, such as:  

• 

Japan is targeting using 3 million tonnes per year of hydrogen including 1 million tonnes of 
imports by 2030. 

•  Republic of Korea is targeting the use of 3.9 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2030, 

up from 220,000 tonnes in 2021. 

•  European Union is targeting the import of 10 million tonnes of hydrogen in 2030 

(plus 10 million tonnes of domestic production). 

Australia’s skilled workforce will also be advantageous to establish a domestic renewable 
hydrogen industry, but our clean energy workforce will need to be scaled up to meet the full 
potential of renewable hydrogen in Australia.  

Green Metals 

Australia has significant potential to become one of the lowest-cost producers of green metals. 
The industry:  

• 

Is highly energy intensive and can take advantage of our abundant renewable resources;  

•  Can make a major contribution to decarbonisation; 

•  Can achieve economies of scale in Australia; and  

•  Aligns with our international trading partners’ current and future needs.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  17 

 
 
 
 
Contribution to net zero 

Decarbonising metal production will play a critical role in the net zero transformation because 
metals are essential inputs into core infrastructure, current methods are emissions-intensive 
and the relative cost of abatement means green metals will make an important contribution to 
cost-efficient decarbonisation pathways.  

Significant quantities of iron, steel, alumina and aluminium will be required to support the 
energy transition, globally and domestically, because they are used in industries that support 
the net zero transformation including wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicles. They are 
also essential inputs to other sectors of the economy, including construction, manufacturing, 
infrastructure, energy and defence, that will need to decarbonise. According to Wood 
Mackenzie, global demand will increase by around 61 per cent for aluminiumvi, and 13 per cent 
for steelvii between 2023 and 2050 in a scenario that is consistent with a 1.5 degrees trajectory.  

Current production technologies are highly emissions intensive. Producing metals requires large 
amounts of energy, resulting in substantial carbon emissions if using traditional production 
methods. The global steel sector accounts for around 10 per cent of global carbon emissionsviii, 
and the aluminium and alumina industry accounts for around 3 per cent of global carbon 
emissions.ix As the world progressively targets net zero while prioritising least cost abatement, 
emissions from metals production will ultimately need to decline. 

Australia already has a significant metals industry, with the iron, steel, aluminium and alumina 
industries accounting for around 11 per cent of Australia’s emissions.x Reducing emissions from 
Australian metals production would make a key contribution to Australia’s net zero target and 
prevent ‘carbon leakage’, where emissions-intensive tradable activities shift production to 
regions with less ambitious emissions reduction targets. Australia’s metals producers are also 
large employers in regional areas. Supporting the decarbonisation of these industries will 
support the transition of these regions and the retention of highly skilled and specialised roles 
across the Australian economy. 

The private sector is already starting to invest in green metals technologies. Earlier this year 
Rio Tinto signed Australia’s largest renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) to date to 
supply its Boyne aluminium smelter.xi CSIRO, ARENA, universities, and the private sector have 
built extensive expertise in low-emission steel and aluminium technologies to guide future 
demonstrations and industry development. 

Green building standards are also creating demand for green metals, and around 85 per cent of 
Australian exports in 2020 went to countries that have net zero emissions pledges.xii 

However, markets that clearly differentiate low-emissions products are still nascent, demand 
for green metals at a price that incorporates the benefits of abatement is limited, and 
early-movers face significant capital risk and innovation costs. There is a role for government 
to improve certification and trade of low-emissions metals, promote demand at a price that 
accounts for the additional cost of efficient abatement, and to spread the costs and benefits of 
overcoming innovation challenges across the industry. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  18 

 
 
Comparative advantage 

Australia’s significant endowment of the ores used to forge metals underpins Australia’s current 
comparative advantage in metals production. Australia is the world’s largest producer of iron 
ore and second largest producer of bauxite – producing 39 per cent of global iron ore and 
26 per cent of global bauxite in 2023.xiii Supported by this foundational advantage, Australia’s 
green metals industry could operate at significant scale and leverage skilled workers and 
advanced technologies to deliver highly efficient operations.  

Australia has the potential to produce variable and firmed renewable energy at competitive 
prices (Chart 1). Combined with Australia’s natural advantages in the production of metallic 
ores, Australia’ comparative advantage is expected to strengthen as demand for metals shifts 
towards low-emissions products and favours countries with plentiful renewable energy. Some 
metal industries are also located in industrial precincts, some of which are proximate to 
renewable energy generation. Australia has potential to become one of the lowest cost places 
in the world to make green metals. In addition, Australia has an existing skilled workforce, 
strengths in research and development and proximity to fast growing Indo-Pacific markets.  

Low Carbon Liquid Fuels 

Australia is likely to have a comparative advantage in the production of some feedstocks used to 
produce LCLFs, or in the production of LCLFs, or both. The sector:  

• 

is energy-intensive and capable of substantially reducing its carbon emissions by taking 
advantage of our abundant renewable energy resources;   

•  has output that embodies low carbon emissions and can contribute to decarbonisation in 

other areas of the economy;  

• 

is able to achieve economies of scale in Australia; and 

•  aligns with our international trading partners’ current or future needs. 

Contribution to net zero 

LCLFs will play a key role as the global and Australian economies transition to net zero, offering 
viable decarbonisation pathways for many sectors. These fuels are expected to be utilised by 
hard to abate sectors where performance requirements are high and few alternative emissions 
abatement options are likely to become available, such as medium-long distance domestic 
aviation, heavy road vehicles, maritime and non-transport sectors. 

The Australian economy currently relies on liquid fuels for around half of its final energy 
demand. This is particularly the case for transport, which accounts for around 70 per cent of 
Australia’s consumption of refined liquid fuel products. Sectors of the economy reliant on liquid 
fossil fuels are starting to transition to lower carbon options to achieve emissions abatement 
targets, often through electrification. This is most apparent in passenger motor vehicles. 
However, other liquid fuel-dependent categories are less advanced and in some cases the 
decarbonisation pathway is not yet clear. These include medium-long distance domestic 
aviation, heavy road vehicles, maritime and non-transport sectors such as mining, agriculture 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  19 

 
 
and construction, which will represent close to 20 per cent of Australia’s emissions out to 
2030.xiv Current Government projections for these sectors suggest they will remain reliant on 
liquid fuels – particularly jet fuel and diesel (or their equivalents) – to 2050 (Chart 3).  

LCLFs provide an alternative option to start reducing emissions. LCLFs have low- to zero-net 
lifecycle emissions during their production and use, compared with the fuels they are displacing, 
and can currently be produced sustainably from waste materials and biomass. In the long term 
it may be possible to produce LCLFs by combining hydrogen from low- or zero-carbon 
feedstocks with captured carbon dioxide. LCLFs can be produced using a variety of technology 
pathways and feedstock inputs, each with different emissions abatement potential and cost. 
Depending on the fuel, some internal combustion engines in current use can tolerate 
100 per cent LCLFs as a full replacement for conventional fossil fuels, whereas others will 
require blending or gradual incorporation. 

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is approximately two to five times the cost of 
conventional jet fuel, but provides the cheapest available approach to abatement for the 
aviation industry.xv Renewable diesel is estimated to be more than twice as expensive as 
conventional diesel, though this estimate depends heavily on market movements and 
international supply. Technology costs for fuels with higher abatement are expected to 
decrease over time as production processes and scale improve. Early investments in this area 
can lay the foundations for a future LCLF industry.

Comparative advantage 

Australia’s landmass, temperate climates, advanced farming practices, access to renewable 
feedstocks, established supply chains and renewable energy potential are all assets in 
developing a range of feedstocks to support a domestic LCLF industry to operate at scale.xvi  

The CSIRO estimates Australia has enough biogenic feedstocks to produce 60 per cent of local 
SAF demand by 2025, growing to 90 per cent by 2050 as biogenic sources continue to grow and 
hydrogen production ramps up. This equates to $10 billion of fuel at production costs in 2025 
and $19 billion in 2050. Australia is already a competitive producer of feedstocks used for LCLFs, 
exporting 400 kt of tallow and approximately 3.4 Mt of canola seed to Europe in 2022. 
Competitiveness in this segment of the supply chain contributes to broader cost 
competitiveness as feedstock costs are a primary driver of the total costs of producing LCLFs.  

One of the principal challenges of achieving commerciality is aligning sufficient offtake 
agreements with feedstock providers with demand for sustainable fuels, at a scale that supports 
establishing a production facility. However, the Australian aviation industry is large enough to 
provide demand for commercial-scale refineries, provided there is broad adoption of SAF as 
part of the transition to net zero.  

The CSIRO analysis suggests Australia has significant potential to be a competitive producer of 
SAF over time if the industry scales up. CSIRO reports under a ‘high scenario’, that includes 
government policies to support a LCLF industry, that Australia could potentially produce 
9,794 million litres of SAF by 2050. This compares to 717 million litres for New Zealand, 
12,139 million litres for Indonesia, 5,803 million litres for Vietnam, and 4,221 million litres for 
Malaysia. There is currently less analysis about the prospects for other LCLF types, including 
renewable diesel. 

Government’s role in incentivising investment in net zero industries 

There is significant private sector interest in building new competitive, renewable hydrogen, 
green metals and LCLF industries in Australia. However, private investment has been limited by 
immature supply chains for key renewable inputs, innovation challenges, lack of differentiated 
product markets and the emerging nature of demand for green products.  

Immature supply chains for low-emissions energy and fuels 

In many cases, building new low-emissions industries at scale requires sustainable energy and 
fuels to be available at scale. Accelerating the delivery of low-cost, reliable renewable energy is 
foundational to realising Australia’s competitive advantages in energy-intensive, low-emissions 
industries. In this regard, there are also interdependencies between the sectors considered in 
this paper, with the availability of low-cost renewable hydrogen being a key enabler of 
commercial green metals operations.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  21 

 
 
Renewable hydrogen is currently substantially more expensive than unabated gas but is 
expected to become cost-competitive over time as the cost of producing hydrogen from 
renewable energy declines. Similarly, the majority of current green metals pathways require 
large quantities of cost competitive renewable hydrogen. Growing production and reducing the 
costs of renewable energy, renewable hydrogen and LCLFs will be key to enabling efficient 
investment in products that use these fuels and key inputs. 

Promoting innovation and technology diffusion 

Transforming industrial processes to be low in emissions will require significant innovation. For 
example, even if the required volumes were available, the current costs of processing iron ore 
and refining alumina using renewable hydrogen are far higher than what can be achieved using 
coal and gas. Cost reductions are expected as key technologies such as electrolysers improve, 
new industrial processes like low-emissions direct iron reduction are developed, and early 
movers improve the viability and efficiency of production at scale through learning-by-doing. 

Public investment should focus on establishing strong incentives for the private sector to invest 
in innovation activities that have broad public benefits, and supporting the diffusion of these 
technologies and capabilities. In many cases, effective innovation is linked to strong trade 
partnerships and international engagement, to ensure innovations developed overseas are 
efficiently transferred to Australian industries. The case for public investment in Australian 
innovation is particularly strong where innovation challenges and opportunities are 
Australia-specific – such as the case for research and development to support the prospects of 
processing ores more commonly available in Australia (such as haematite). 

Promoting efficient capital investment 

Developing large-scale net zero industries require substantial investment in infrastructure. 
This includes port infrastructure, electricity networks, water infrastructure, as well as broader 
transport and social infrastructure to support regional workforces. Many of these infrastructure 
requirements have common-use benefits so may require coordinated or public investment to 
justify efficient investment. In other instances, new net zero industries require bespoke 
commercial infrastructure. This includes dedicated pipelines to transport hydrogen and new 
commercial-scale green metals facilities.  

In some instances, these new capital needs are incremental and can be delivered within 
business-as-usual levels of capital expenditure. A recent report from the Australian Industry 
Energy Transitions Initiative found that around $625 billion of coordinated investment is 
required to decarbonise Australia’s industry and energy system, with around $400 billion of 
investment relating to capital that would have been replaced or upgraded over this period 
under business-as-usual conditions.xvii However, uncertainty around the timing and price of 
demand for green products can discourage early movers from making large capital investments.

Green premium and absence of strong markets 

The costs of net zero products are expected to decline over time as key inputs are produced 
more efficiently, innovation barriers are overcome and efficient infrastructure is established. 
However, some products that will play an essential role in delivering a low-cost net zero 
transformation are still expected to have higher production costs than high-emissions 
alternatives, as they include the cost of efficient abatement.  

As green markets mature, demand for green products is expected to grow and the ability for 
consumers to differentiate between products on the basis of their emissions intensity is 
expected to improve. Governments have an important role to play in developing these markets: 
creating demand for green products through standards and regulations, supporting the 
certification of products’ emissions intensity, promoting well-functioning markets that allow 
customers to preference green products, and promoting competitive trade that minimises 
carbon leakage and supports the achievement of global net zero emission commitments.  

However, during the period where these markets are maturing, the additional cost of 
low-emissions products that aligns with the emissions reduction benefits embedded in the 
product may not be sufficiently valued by the market. This can limit the efficient development 
of these technologies, with an absence of demand causing an absence of supply. In these 
instances, public investment that aligns with a cost-efficient ‘green premium’ may be justified. 

The role of government 

Government needs to take steps to help circumvent these barriers to enable these sectors to 
achieve their potential. 

From an enabling perspective, that means delivering renewable energy, supporting 
well-targeted innovation, and partnering with the private sector to deliver impactful 
infrastructure. It also means government should work to ensure regulatory and international 
trade settings work to build well-functioning markets and promote demand for products that 
deliver efficient abatement. Over time, this should establish efficient price signals. 

However, in the meantime, there may be cause for public support that aligns private price 
signals with broader public value, and helps sectors to bridge up-front capital cost hurdles. In 
some cases, this could include production support or contributions to the capital investments 
necessary to transition to green production processes.

Economic Resilience and Security Stream 

Critical Minerals Processing 

A stable and diversified supply of critical minerals is critical to the smooth operation of global 
and domestic supply chains, including to support the net zero transformation, defence 
industries and a range of other applications. However, currently:  

•  Global supply is highly concentrated and vulnerable to disruption;  

•  There is limited capacity for the industry to quickly adapt and respond to any shock; and  

•  The consequences of a serious supply disruption would be significant.  

Criticality to economic resilience and security 

Critical minerals are metallic or non-metallic elements that are essential inputs across a range of 
sectors that support the net zero transformation, economic resilience and security and defence, 
and underpin global supply chains that are vulnerable to disruptions.xviii The net zero 
transformation will increase the demand for critical minerals that are required for renewable 
energy technologies such as hydrogen electrolysers, batteries and solar panels (Chart 4).xix 
Under scenarios that achieve net zero emissions by 2050, global demand for critical minerals is 
expected to increase by around 350 per cent by 2040.xx  

Critical minerals are important to the economic resilience and security of countries because 
they enable a range of technologies required for the basic functioning of a modern society, 
including defence and communications technologies. The global race to secure supplies of 
critical minerals is accelerating rapidly.  

Critical mineral supply chains are also prone to disruption because mineral production and 
processing is heavily concentrated in particular locations, facilities or companies. Supply chains 
that are highly concentrated, are typically fragile, volatile and lack transparency. Under these 
conditions markets and their participants cannot adequately price and manage risks, making it 
hard for businesses to access commercial investment and compete on a level playing field.

Australia’s role in supply chain diversification  

Australia is well placed to help meet expected demand for critical minerals. The geographic and 
economic footprint of our critical minerals sector has grown, and we are becoming a globally 
significant producer of raw and processed critical minerals. Australia has some of the world’s 
largest reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements (Table 1).xxi 
In addition to significant known reserves, Australia has potential for more undiscovered 
minerals, with around 80 per cent of the land mass largely under-explored.xxii 

Australia’s critical minerals and broader mining sector has long-standing expertise in extracting 
minerals and a track record as a stable, reliable and responsible exporter of resources to 
support the scale of investment required. Australia has a clear comparative advantage in the 
extraction and export of minerals and mining engineering and services, which has been 
developed through innovation, economies of scale and a skilled workforce. We also have 
long-standing relationships with key partners that has supported investment.

Global markets are increasingly placing emphasis on the provenance of minerals. Consumers 
and financiers want to have confidence that the minerals in their supply chains have been 
produced using high environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Companies may 
need to increasingly engage with minerals provenance issues as policy settings evolve globally. 
This places Australia in a favourable position to capitalise on our high ESG standards, acting as 
a differentiating factor compared to some other countries.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  26 

 
 
 
Barriers to private investment and role for government 

Critical minerals producers face complex operational and market challenges. Projects often 
involve technical risks associated with complex mineralogy, the need for specialised processing, 
and the challenges of operating in remote areas and securing access to significant energy 
supply. These projects can also be difficult to finance and operate due to high capital 
requirements, opaque markets, volatile prices and a lack of recognition of ESG standards. 
Together, these factors can pose challenges for securing offtake, equity and debt finance.  

Well-designed government support can de-risk investment and crowd in private sector funding, 
including from international investors who value secure and reliable sources of supply. 
Common-use infrastructure can help first-movers achieve commerciality and help precincts 
achieve economies of scale. Tailored public financing arrangements can also help projects 
manage price risk over a long time period, and unlock further financing opportunities. 

Expanding a secure and sustainable supply of high quality refined critical minerals is also of 
geostrategic value to Australia and key trading partners. Private sector customers are not 
always well placed to manage the risk of supply chain disruption and may not account for the 
broader public costs of this risk. For this reason, strategic products such as critical minerals, with 
supply chains that are highly exposed to disruption and where there are few alternative sources 
of supply to support diversification, may require public support that accounts for the public 
value of prudent management of geostrategic risk and promotes private investment at scale. 

Clean energy manufacturing 

Clean energy products are critical for Australia’s transition to net zero and supporting energy 
security through that process. There may be a case for developing domestic capacity where:  

•  Global supply is highly concentrated and vulnerable to disruption;  

•  There is limited capacity for the industry to quickly adapt and respond to any shock; and  

•  The consequences of a serious supply disruption would be significant.  

Criticality to economic resilience and security  

Australia is undergoing a significant energy transition in response to the global decarbonisation 
imperative and the significant improvements in the economics of renewable generation. 
The success of this transition will be contingent on having a reliable supply of clean energy 
technologies to ensure Australia’s ongoing energy security, as a critical enabler of Australia’s 
economic prosperity and standard of living.  

The high concentration of supply chains of key clean energy technologies poses risks to energy 
security and economic resilience. More than 75 per cent of the supply of solar panel and battery 
technologies comes from one country (Chart 5). This creates exposure to trade disruptions, 
competition for scarce supply, and unexpected events such as natural disasters that could 
impact production in a particular location. Supply and demand imbalances across different 
clean energy technologies are already causing long delivery times for some critical components. 
For example, high voltage transmission cables are reported to have a seven year wait for supply, 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  27 

 
 
and hydrogen electrolysers are expected to require significant increased production beyond 
current capacity.

Strong trading partnerships will ensure Australia continues to benefit from low-cost 
technologies manufactured in countries with highly competitive manufacturing cost bases 
for reasons including economies of scale. For example, China’s global competitiveness in 
manufacturing and government investments over several decades has allowed it to develop 
significant scale and expertise in clean energy technology, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) 
supply chains. Access to these products reduces the cost of renewable energy production in 
Australia, strengthening Australia’s potential to become a renewable energy superpower.  

Australia’s role in supply chain diversification  

Globally, countries are responding to the extreme concentration of solar and battery supply 
chains by diversifying where clean energy technologies are manufactured. The United States’ 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  28 

 
 
 
 
Inflation Reduction Act provides significant tax incentives for clean energy technology 
manufacturing. Europe, Canada, France and India are implementing incentives likely to drive 
domestic manufacturing in areas such as solar PV and batteries. It is likely these subsidies will 
lead to lower geographic concentration for specific technology in the future, and Australian 
consumers will benefit from any improvement in supply chain diversity and competition, 
subsidised by international taxpayers. 

Accessing cheap clean energy technologies that are manufactured offshore supports Australia’s 
ambition to become a renewable energy superpower. Strong trade partnerships, such as those 
in place with jurisdictions such as the United States and India, can be used to diversify 
Australia’s supply and reduce supply chain risks.  

Australia is also making an important contribution to the development of clean energy 
technologies, leveraging our considerable capabilities in research, discovery and development. 
Developing and commercialising new technologies, especially those relevant to Australia’s 
unique conditions and comparative strengths, will continue to be an important area for private 
and public cooperation to reduce critical economic vulnerabilities, and an important 
contribution to Australia’s trade partnerships.  

Barriers to private investment and role for government 

The most significant barrier to private investment in clean energy manufacturing in Australia is 
the cost competitiveness of alternative manufacturing locations, and the fact that Australia has 
higher operating costs. The competitiveness of Australian producers is typically driven by their 
product differentiation and design innovations that attract a premium from particular market 
segments. 

Where some degree of domestic capability is assessed to be prudent, due to global 
concentration of supply and pronounced geostrategic risks, there may be a case for the 
Government to support the development of targeted domestic manufacturing capabilities.  

Where public investment is intended to reduce geostrategic risks, it should be done in a way 
that strengthens trading partnerships and encourages Australia’s integration into global supply 
chains. This should complement trade and resilience initiatives which improve Australia’s access 
to critical products in the circumstance of supply chain disruptions. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  29 

 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
The global environment is changing rapidly. The net zero transformation is a critical global 
challenge that requires clear market signals and consistent policy direction. At the same time, 
a more contested geostrategic environment and recent shocks have increased the value of 
resilient and diversified global supply chains.  

The strong fundamentals that have underpinned Australia’s past economic success will continue 
to serve us well in this changing world. Our natural advantages, most notably our abundant 
renewable energy resources and critical mineral deposits mean we are well placed to prosper in 
the years ahead and play a critical role in the net zero global economy.  

The private sector and government both have a critical role to play to seize these opportunities. 
The Future Made in Australia agenda takes steps to foster and encourage the significant private 
sector investment into priority industries necessary to harness the opportunities of this 
changing global environment.

Prime Minister of Australia

The Hon Dr Jim Chalmers MP

Treasurer

Listen

The Albanese Labor Government will invest in a Future Made in
Australia plan to bring new jobs and opportunities to communities in
every part of our country.

Making our future here in Australia is about making the most of our
nationʼs potential and making sure everyone shares in the benefits.

Our plan will maximise the economic and industrial benefits of the
international move to net zero and secure Australiaʼs place in a
changing global economic and strategic landscape.

The 2024 25 Budget will invest $22.7 billion over a decade to help
Australia succeed and remain an indispensable part of the global

economy as the world undergoes the biggest transformation since

the industrial revolution.

This plan will help Australia build a stronger, more diversified and

more resilient economy powered by clean energy, to create more

secure, well-paid jobs and encourage and facilitate the private

sector investment required to make the most of this opportunity.

It will invest in innovation and technology that will help ensure we

remain globally competitive, and recognises the vital role of regional

Australia in our national prosperity.

The Future Made in Australia plan is about attracting and enabling

investment, making Australia a renewable energy superpower,

value-adding to our resources and strengthening economic

security, backing Australian ideas and investing in the people,
communities and services that will drive our national success.

project development, employment transition and skills and
community development; and

— $178.6 million in additional employment and skills supports for

regions in transition, including the Energy Industry Jobs Plan
and place-based Regional Workforce Transition Plans.

These policies complement the Governmentʼs broader growth
agenda, including our competition reforms, investments in

infrastructure, housing, human capital and defence industry, and

support for small businesses.

The Future Made in Australia agenda will be guided by a new

National Interest Framework to better align economic incentives

with our national interests, which will be established under a Future
Made in Australia Act.

Under the Framework, priority industries will be identified under two

streams. The ‘net zero transformationʼ stream will identify sectors

that can make a significant contribution to achieving net zero,
where Australia has grounds to build enduring sources of

comparative advantage. The ‘economic security and resilienceʼ
stream will identify sectors that are critical to our resilience, are

vulnerable to supply disruptions and that require support to unlock
sufficient private investment.

This Framework will guide Government decision making on

significant public investments, particularly those used to incentivise

private investment at scale. Further detail is outlined in the National
Interest Framework supporting paper published today by the

Treasury.

The Government will also apply Community Benefit Principles to
significant investments in priority industries, which will have a focus

on boosting investment in local communities, supply chains and
skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and secure jobs.

The Albanese Government recognises that the best opportunities

for Australia and its people lie at the intersection of industry, energy,
resources, skills and our ability to attract and deploy investment.

The Future Made in Australia plan improves our investment

environment and encourages new industries that put us on a path to
net zero and strengthen our economic resilience.

Making Australians the bene ciaries of change

A Future Made in Australia is about creating new jobs and
opportunities for every part of our country by maximising the

economic and industrial bene ts of the move to net zero and securing
Australia’s place in a changing global economic and strategic
landscape.

The Government’s $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package will
help facilitate the private sector investment required for Australia to
be an indispensable part of the global economy.

fact sheet [PDF 438KB]

Better deploying capital in priority areas

The Future Made in Australia package will realise Australia’s potential
to become a renewable energy superpower, value‑add to our
resources and strengthen economic security by better attracting and

enabling investment in priority areas. The Government will create a

Future Made in Australia Act and establish a National Interest

Framework that identi es priority industries and ensures investments

associated with them are responsible and targeted.

The Framework will have a focus on industries that contribute to the

net zero transformation where Australia has a comparative

advantage, and where Australia has national interest imperatives

related to economic resilience and security.

Strengthening and streamlining approvals

This Budget provides a faster pathway to better decisions on
environmental, energy, planning, cultural heritage and foreign
investment approvals.

This includes:

$134.2 million to better prioritise approvals for renewable energy
projects of national signi cance, and support faster decisions on
environment, cultural heritage and planning approvals.
Working with the states and territories through the Energy and
Climate Change Ministerial Council to accelerate electricity grid
connections.
$20.7 million to improve engagement with communities impacted

by the energy transition and accelerate the delivery of key
energy projects.
$15.7 million to strengthen scrutiny of high‑risk foreign
investment proposals, enhance monitoring and enforcement
activities and support faster decisions.

The Government will also encourage foreign investment by providing
refunds of 75 per cent of application fees for unsuccessful
competitive bids.

Promoting sustainable  nance

The Government is committing $17.3 million to mobilise private sector

investment in sustainable activities. This includes extending

Australia’s sustainable  nance taxonomy to the agriculture sector

and developing a labelling regime for  nancial products marketed as

sustainable.

The Government will also examine opportunities to improve data

quality and provide $1.3 million to develop and issue guidance for

best practice transition plans.

Making Australia a renewable
energy superpower
Powering Australia with cheaper, cleaner,
more reliable energy
