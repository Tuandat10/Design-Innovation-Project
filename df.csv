Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) mandates investment in renewable electricity generation
through a renewable energy certiﬁcate market. A legislated national consultative review of the RET was
carried out in 2012, resulting in 8660 submissions. Respondents were invited to comment on the value of
the legislated target, including whether the legislated target should be a ﬁxed GWh target or a ﬁxed
policy-based percentage-of-demand target, and the impact of review processes on the renewable energy
industry. This paper presents the ﬁrst analysis of submissions and evaluates their implications for the
future of this policy. There was a consistent alignment of opinion amongst respondents, with industry
and fossil-fuel generation/retailer groups opposing the RET objectives, whilst these were supported by
NGOs and the renewable sector. However, most respondents favoured maintaining the overall goal of
providing 20% renewable electricity generation by 2020. Concerns were raised by most groups of re-
spondents regarding policy continuity and excessive reviewing procedures. In its response to the review,
the Climate Change Authority made a total of 34 recommendations, 18 maintaining the status quo. Only
six recommendations were endorsed by the Australian Government that would result in changes to the
scheme. It is concluded that such review processes can be signiﬁcantly harmful to maintaining stability
and certainty in an industry requiring long-term commitment for investments, and that the Australian
Government continues to favour the status quo in responding to consultative review processes relating
to renewable energy policies.

1. Introduction e the renewable energy target legislation and
review processes in Australia

The role of renewable energy in replacing incumbent fossil-fuel
generating electricity systems is assuming greater signiﬁcance as
governments are under pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions. The enduring question within the renewable energy policy
framework is how much support (economically and otherwise) the
renewable energy industry requires to thrive.

Australia has had three manifestations of national legislation
aimed at promoting the renewable energy industry and, in turn,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The measurable outcome of
these policies is to see an increase in the proportion of ‘clean’ gen-
eration technologies in the electricity generation mix [1]. This is done
by requiring electricity retailers to source a proportion of the elec-
tricity for their customers from certiﬁed ‘clean’ generators through
the purchase of renewable energy certiﬁcates, encompassing both

large-scale renewable sources such as wind farms and small-scale
sources such as household renewable technologies.

Periodic reviews of the schemes were included as a requirement
of the legislation. The ﬁrst of these reviews was the Tambling Re-
view in 2003, which invited submissions on the functioning of the
initial legislation [1]. Subsequent to the Tambling Review were
frequent additional review processes that considered the legislative
framework, speciﬁc aspects of the legislation and the interaction
between the legislation and other policy initiatives [2]. A review of
the most recent incarnation of the legislation, to be undertaken by
the independent Climate Change Authority, was initiated in August
2012 [1].

These review processes and the broader academic literature
regarding renewable energy certiﬁcates highlight various issues
with the development of such policies. These include the lack of
appropriate consultation processes when developing legislation
[3]; the lack of certainty and consistency in renewable energy
policies, in particular for small-scale renewable energy technolo-
gies [4]; and the on-going commitment to existing policies
favouring the status quo and fossil-fuel generating industries in
particular [5].

Kent and Mercer [6] proposed that the submissions made
available as part of the 2003 Tambling Review provided potentially
the most comprehensive overview of the status of Australia’s
renewable energy sector. Ten years have elapsed since this review,
with changes in Government, relevant legislation and industry over
this time. An assessment of the submissions to the most recent
review of the legislation, the 2012 Climate Change Authority’s re-
view of the RET, therefore provides insight into the current state of
the renewable energy sector and perceptions of renewable legis-
lation and associated policy development processes.

2. Material and methods

The Climate Change Authority undertook a consultative review
process, including the development of an issues paper for general
comment, and a discussion paper that provided a draft of ﬁnal
recommendations for further comment. There were 8660 sub-
missions received in response to the Issues Paper (8500 campaign
submissions and 160 stakeholder submissions), with 54 responses
to the Discussion Paper [1]. Four roundtables and 60 one-on-one
interviews were undertaken over the course of the review process.
This assessment of the Australian Government’s Renewable
Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 legislation and the associated Climate
Change Authority Review of the RET follows a similar approach to
Kent and Mercer’s [6] evaluation of the Tambling Review process.
Submissions to the Climate Change Authority’s Issues Paper were
critically assessed against the questions posed within the Review
Issues Paper. All submissions were assessed according to criteria as
outlined in Kent and Mercer [6], namely the type of stakeholder,
their overall perspective of the legislation (whether they support or
reject its value) and any particular issues of note to the stakeholder.
Particular issues of interest were those surrounding the effects of
uncertainty in the legislation on industry, including in relation to
the GWh target, the effects of continual review processes, and
perceptions of embedded policies favouring other technology
types, including a certiﬁcate multiplier for small-scale photovoltaic
systems. Information on the number of responses to particular
themes was recorded by stakeholder type (peak industry group,
corporation, academic, individual, environmental NGO), with sup-
porting statements provided alongside each respondent’s details.
The Final Review Report was released on 19 December 2012 [7].
The Australian Government’s formal response to recommendations
outlined in the Final Review Report was released on 23 March 2013
[8]. The Climate Change Authority’s recommendations and the
Australian Government’s response to the Climate Change Author-
ity’s Review Report were examined. Analysis of the extent to which
the Australian Government is prepared to undertake modiﬁcations
to the legislation in light of the Climate Change Authority’s ﬁndings
assisted in determining whether the review process is seen as
beneﬁcial to Australia’s renewable energy industry or whether it is
an unnecessary disturbance.

Collection of data for the research was via the Climate Change
Authority website [7], which publishes all calls for submission,
submissions from stakeholders and the Review Report itself. The
Australian Government published its response to the Climate
Change Authority’s Review Report and recommendations
through the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efﬁ-
ciency website [8].

3. Theory e Australia’s RET e targets, legislation and reviews

The ﬁrst of Australia’s renewable energy schemes came into
force in April 2001 under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act
2000 [6]. The key measure of the Act was the initiation of the
Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET), which was to see a 2%

per annum increase to renewable energy generation by 2010, from
a 1996/1997 10.5% baseline. Energy demand forecasts at the time of
setting the target were used to equate the additional 2% renewable
generation to a GWh target, namely 9500 GWh, which was the
legislated target included in the Act.

Periodic reviews of the scheme were included as a requirement
in the legislation. The Tambling Review in 2003 invited sub-
missions on the functioning of the MRET [9]. The review process
determined that an increase in electricity demand between the
scheme’s initiation and the time of review had resulted in the
9500 GWh target equating to less than a 2% increase in renewable
generation. The Review Panel’s recommendations included main-
taining the 9500 GWh target to 2010 and then increasing the target
to 2020 to promote industry investment. The Government sup-
ported the maintenance of the 9500 GWh target but rejected the
proposal to expand the scheme. The Review Panel also considered
amending the legislation to state a ﬁxed percentage target with a
ﬂoating GWh value, as opposed to the ﬁxed GWh target. The Re-
view Panel recommended maintaining a ﬁxed GWh target to
ensure certainty for investors.

In August 2009,

legislation was passed to implement the
expanded national RET, which brought the former MRET and
existing and proposed state and territory schemes into one national
scheme [10]. It expanded the previous MRET to a forecast 20%
contribution to the electricity mix by 2020, set in the legislation as
45,000 GWh. The RET also included speciﬁc support for small-scale,
rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, through the ‘Solar Credits
Multiplier’ [1].

In June 2010, further legislation was passed to separate the
expanded national RET into two parts, the Large-scale Renewable
Energy Target (LRET), covering large-scale projects such as wind
farms, commercial solar and geothermal, and the Small-scale
Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES), covering domestic photovol-
taic, wind turbine and efﬁcient water-heating technologies [1]. The
legislation separated the 45,000 GWh target into 41,000 GWh by
2020 for the LRET and a minimum 4000 GWh by 2020 for the SRES.
The changes were designed to provide greater certainty for large-
scale renewable energy projects, households and installers of
small-scale renewable energy systems.

To date, the MRET and RET have resulted in renewable energy
capacity almost doubling from 10,650 MW in 2001 to 19,700 MW in
2012 [1]. In spite of this, due to an increase in demand for electricity
within Australia, renewable electricity generation as a proportion of
total electricity generation per year has not changed signiﬁcantly
since 2000/01, having grown from approximately 8% to 10%. Wind
and solar photovoltaic (PV) technology make up the majority of new
renewable generation as a result of the MRET and RET [11]. Wind
generation has grown under the RET from 200 GWh in 2000/01 to
5800 GWh in 2010/11. Solar photovoltaic generation has increased
over the same time period from 50 GWh to 850 GWh (Fig. 1).

Under the 2011 updated legislation enacting the RET, the
Climate Change Authority was tasked with completing a review of
the scheme before the end of 31 December 2012 [12]. While the
Climate Change Authority did not have a stipulated Terms of
Reference for undertaking the review, any recommendation put
forward by the Authority may not be inconsistent with the objec-
tives of the Act, which were to a) encourage the additional gener-
ation of electricity from renewable sources; b) reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and c) ensure renewable
energy sources are ecologically sustainable [13].

4. Results and discussion

All of the 160 stakeholder submissions were read and analysed
according to areas of note within the Issues Paper. The 8500

in the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within Australia,
with many citing the Copenhagen Accord’s goal of a 5% reduction in
emissions relative to 2000 by 2020 as a primary driver for the need
to reduce emissions. A handful of respondents also focused on the
need to invest in renewable energy generation to diversify Aus-
tralia’s electricity generation system, avoiding the impacts of
increasing fossil fuel costs associated with ‘peak oil’ and exposure
to international gas markets.

Approximately 14% of respondents to this portion of the Issues
Paper (N ¼ 132) argued for a reduction in the value of the 2020
target to match current demand forecasts. All but one of these re-
spondents were from corporations or industry groups with a
mixed-energy (fossil fuel and renewable) or fossil fuel focus. The
majority of respondents noted increasing electricity costs associ-
ated with the RET as damaging for business and that the Australian
Government should therefore endorse its initial commitment to
‘20% renewable energy by 2020’. Additionally, most stakeholders
stated that the 2012 implementation of a carbon pricing mecha-
nism in Australia meant there was no need for the RET. Re-
spondents stated that the RET should only be maintained to 2020 in
order to ensure investor certainty.

While some renewable-focussed stakeholders supported an
increase to the 2020 target, 89% of them requested that the current
2020 target be maintained (N ¼ 45). This is a counter-intuitive
response given it is renewable-focussed industry that is most
likely to beneﬁt from an increase in the target. A total of 63% of all
respondents requested that the target be maintained (N ¼ 132),
with responses spread across all stakeholder groups except fossil-
fuel based corporations. The reasons for maintaining the target
were varied, with many responses refuting reasons put forward to
reduce the target to updated demand projections. It was noted that
demand forecasting practices are inherently unreliable and that
any number of changes in the future could alter the demand proﬁle.
There was considerable speculation that making signiﬁcant
changes to the RET as a result of the introduction of the carbon
pricing mechanism may be unwise. It was suggested that Austral-
ia’s carbon pricing mechanism may not be able to facilitate in-
vestment in renewable energy as a result of its currently low value,
the exposure of the carbon price to international markets, and most
importantly that the security of the carbon pricing mechanism is
not assured. The Australian Government opposition party has
vowed to abolish the carbon pricing legislation if it gains power
following the September 2013 General Election [14]. Importantly,
respondents noted that the Australian Government’s explicit policy
commitment was to meet ‘at least’ 20% of electricity demands in
2020 through renewable generation, and that this did not provide
for a maximum renewable commitment. Finally, 38% of re-
spondents to this line of questioning (N ¼ 132) stated that the RET
should be maintained at the current target level in order to main-
tain investor conﬁdence.

Interestingly, only 6% of submissions responding to this line of
questioning suggested unequivocally that the RET should be

campaign submissions were derived from two key sources: GetUp,
a grassroots community advocacy group (7806 submissions); and
Hepburn Wind, a co-operative implementing the ﬁrst community-
initiated wind farm in Australia (694 submissions). With each of
these two groups of campaign submissions treated as a single
stakeholder submission, the total number of submissions assessed
was 162 (Table 1).

The following discussion focuses on issues cited most frequently
by industry and the public with regard to the RET and is applicable
to other international renewable certiﬁcate trading mechanisms.

4.1. Real, revised and projected e changes to the RET Target value

A major focus of the RET review was the consideration of
whether the Target should be increased, decreased or maintained
at the current legislated level. The decision to reassess the target
was largely in response to reductions in energy demand forecasts
resulting in the 45,000 GWh target making up approximately 26%
of expected electricity demand by 2020/21 [1]. Reasons cited by
respondents for the reduction in demand included increased small-
scale renewable system installation, installation of energy efﬁcient
appliances, milder summers and winters and changes to the in-
dustrial nature of Australia (closing of manufacturing and pro-
cessing plants).

Approximately 17% of stakeholders responding to this line of
questioning (N ¼ 132) requested an increase in the target to 2020.
Respondents recommending an increase to the target were pri-
marily non-government associations and individuals (17 re-
sponses), and renewable-focus corporations and industry groups (5
responses). The majority of these responses argued for an increase

abolished. All but one of these submissions stated that the main
reason for abolishing the RET was that it was no longer required as a
carbon pricing mechanism had been established, and that the RET
did not provide least-cost abatement. This is in spite of the fact that,
of those respondents stating whether they supported or opposed
the RET, 13% were against its inception. The difference between the
number of stakeholders opposing the RET and the number rec-
ommending its abolition stems from the realisation that the RET
has become a component of the Australian energy market, and that
considerable investment by business has been made with regard to
the RET. Both sides of the RET debate, those supporting and
investing in renewables and those reliant on fossil-fuel generation,
increasingly understand the importance of maintaining investor
conﬁdence in Australia by ensuring stability in policy. Increase in
sovereign risk associated with changes to the RET, even if incre-
mental, were deemed to extend beyond the renewable energy
sector to other areas of the Australian industrial economy.

Kent and Mercer [6] noted that the Tambling Review Panel
recommended maintaining the legislated target to ensure industry
certainty. Additionally, the Australian Government agreed to a GWh
target in Parliament on three separate occasions in 2000 [15], 2008
[16] and 2010 [17]. The reasons behind this conclusion have not
changed, and therefore there is reason to question why the target
was reassessed given it was not speciﬁcally required within the
Climate Change Authority’s remit. The removal of subsection 162(h)
from the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 [18], that the
Review must include consideration of ‘the level of the overall target
and interim targets’, was included within the Renewable Energy
(Electricity) Amendment Act 2009 [19]. Though the explanatory
memorandum makes no speciﬁc mention of why this requirement
was repealed [20], its removal does indicate that consideration of
the target’s value was deemed unnecessary.

Leading up to the initiation of the review process there was
considerable scrutiny of the GWh value of the target within the
Australian media. Media interest was driven in large part by fossil-
fuel based generation corporations and high electricity consumers
noting ﬁnancial
implications associated with the RET [21,22].
Renewable interest groups were then vocally opposed to the
reduction of the target in response to industry demands, citing this
[23,24]. Kent and Mercer’s [6]
as self-interested behaviour
concluding remarks note that respondents will be inherently self-
interested in their contributions to consultative policy develop-
ment processes. The case of stakeholder responses to the target
review is clearly an example of this assertion in practice, with the
power of stakeholders and the media apparently inﬂuencing re-
view panel decisions to the potential detriment of the renewable
energy industry.

4.2. To review or not to review? e frequency of review processes

One of the most repetitive themes within submissions to the
Climate Change Authority Review process was the potentially
damaging impact of the Review process itself. The Review process
was a legislative requirement of the RET scheme, however, the
length of time between implementation of the most recent (2010)
changes to the scheme and the initiation of the Review process was
seen as unnecessarily short. 60% of respondents to the section of
the Issues Paper requesting consideration of the frequency of re-
views (N ¼ 70), from across the full spectrum of stakeholders, noted
that the main concern in relation to future review processes was
the need to maintain policy certainty and ensure minimal disrup-
tion to industry. 77% of stakeholders stated that the legislation
should be amended so that there would be more than two years
between each review process (N ¼ 70). An additional 9% of re-
it was not appropriate to change
spondents indicated that

legislation to increase time between reviews, as this would create
additional investment insecurity, but that the scope of future re-
views should be limited considerably and should be made explicit
well ahead of time. In particular, many respondents noted that
there should be only a long-run ﬁxed review timetable, limited to
determining whether future targets were large enough to support
on-going renewable energy investment, with smaller reviews un-
dertaken only when a certain threshold had been reached, for
instance when the shortfall penalty charge (which acts as a price
ceiling in the certiﬁcate market) was being paid instead of pur-
chasing large-scale renewable certiﬁcates.

The focus of submissions on the length of time between review
processes was unsurprising considering the negative consequences
of concurrent and frequent review processes was noted within the
Tambling Review. The Parer Review, which was undertaken
concurrently with the Tambling Review, examined the most cost-
effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and found
that the MRET was inefﬁcient and that an emissions trading scheme
would result in greater environmental beneﬁts [6]. These review
ﬁndings, and the fact that both review processes were undertaken
concurrently, were found to create a level of uncertainty within the
electricity generation industry. This situation was later echoed with
the ﬁnalisation of the RET legislation reportedly overshadowed by
the release of the White Paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction
Scheme (the Australian Government’s emissions trading scheme)
and associated claims by industry that such a scheme would in-
crease electricity costs [10]. The on-going lack of clarity in the
relationship between review processes, potential subsequent
changes to RET legislation, and the interaction between the RET and
an emissions trading scheme creates long-term uncertainty for
industry.

In addition to the recurring theme of uncertainty surrounding
on-going review processes, stakeholders also noted ‘review fatigue’,
with ten review processes speciﬁcally related to the RET in the last
ﬁve years [2], naught resulting in substantial changes to the policy
framework. The Australian Government’s decision to provide op-
portunities for stakeholder feedback at multiple steps in the devel-
opment of legislation is evidence of its preference for consultative
policy-development processes, a system which is increasingly be-
ing questioned. Crase et al. [25] found that such community
consultation processes may be inefﬁcient as successive consultation
processes may contain unique questions and responses to the extent
that each consultation process must be started anew, without an
opportunity for policy-makers to learn from the outcomes of pre-
vious consultation processes. Contrary to this, the RET Issues Paper
responses indicate that the opposite is true e stakeholders are
growing increasingly frustrated with covering similar material, with
the same outcomes, in on-going review processes. That the previous
review processes have been ineffectual in creating marked change to
the policy environment, for the betterment of industry or with
additional environmental beneﬁts,
indicates that these review
processes are ultimately more likely to result in delays in investment
and industry uncertainty. As one respondent to the Issues Paper put
it, ‘constant review is not reform’ [26].

‘Picking winners’ in renewable energy policy e the solar credits

4.3.
multiplier and other schemes

The Solar Credits Multiplier was introduced to the RET in 2009
by the Australian Government as a replacement for the over-
subscribed $8000 Solar Homes and Communities Grant [1]. In
creating the Solar Credits Multiplier the Australian Government
was able to shift the ﬁnancial burden of the Grant from their own
to electricity consumers. The Australian Government
budget
initially designed the scheme with a ﬁve times multiplier, reducing

132

G. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135

each ﬁnancial year to one [1]. Additionally, each small-scale
photovoltaic system received generation certiﬁcates based on a
forecast 15 year ‘deeming period’ [1]. The combination of the solar
credits multiplier and the deeming period led to an initial upfront
rebate equivalent to 75 years of generation. The 75 years of gen-
eration for a system at the initial certiﬁcate price was equivalent to
approximately $7500 [1], close to the value of the Grant the Solar
Credits Multiplier was replacing.

The Solar Credits Multiplier was credited with increasing uptake
of small-scale solar systems, with 18% of respondents to this line of
questioning noting that the scheme resulted in substantial invest-
ment (N ¼ 68). However, a larger proportion of submissions criti-
cised the use of the policy to stimulate investment. A conﬂuence of
factors was cited as causing the Solar Credits Multiplier scheme to
become oversubscribed, including the initiation of generous state-
based feed-in tariff schemes and increased demand creating scales
of economies that reduced the price of systems. In response to the
increased generation of certiﬁcates associated with the scheme the
Australian Government decreased the multiplier ahead of schedule
on two occasions [1], resulting in uncertainty for the small-scale
solar industry. With regards to the Issues Paper submissions,
three key criticisms of the Solar Credits Multiplier were proposed.

4.3.1.

‘Phantom credits’

The Solar Credits Multiplier was unfavourably received by 18
respondents who noted that the multiplication of ‘real’, deemed
certiﬁcates created ‘phantom credits’: certiﬁcates that did not
equate to actual abatement and yet still contributed to the
achievement of the target. There were even calls by some re-
spondents that the RET target value should be increased to take into
account the generation of phantom credits. The exact number of
phantom credits allocated under the RET between the initiation of
the scheme in 2009 and the ﬁnal generation of credits at the end of
2012 has not been made public. However, data available through
the Clean Energy Regulator indicates that ‘phantom credits’ could
have contributed approximately 66% of the certiﬁcates required to
meet the RET target value between 2009 and 2012 (Table 2).

4.3.2. Boomebust cycles

The reduction of multipliers over time was found to create large
surges in sales prior to the reduction of a multiplier, with house-
holders attempting to take advantage of the higher rebates, fol-
lowed by bust periods with reduced householder investment,
resulting in boomebust cycles noted by nine respondents. Data
available from the Clean Energy Regulator [27] reﬂect the reality of
boomebust cycles, with peaks in small-scale installation rates
coincident with the end of multiplier periods (Fig. 2). The boome
bust cycles were felt doubly by installers e not only were market
sales of small-scale renewable systems experiencing ﬂuctuations in
demand but there were coincident ﬂuctuations in the value of
generation certiﬁcates sold within the RET market. The drastic

reduction in demand for certiﬁcates, and reduction in their value,
led to several members of the small-scale solar industry entering
receivership [30]. One submission also credited reduced installa-
tion quality and education of customers, including appropriate
system choice and system orientation, with installers trying to rush
installations through within higher multiplier time periods [31].

4.3.3. REC overhang

The introduction of phantom credits, combined with the over-
subscription to the scheme, resulted in an excessive number of
certiﬁcates being generated. There were two closely associated
outcomes: the larger than expected number of certiﬁcates gener-
ated through the market resulted in retailers purchasing enough
certiﬁcates to cover their RET liability for several years, reducing
future demand for certiﬁcates. The reduction in demand for cer-
tiﬁcates led to a drop in the market value of certiﬁcates still being
sold through the market, to the extent that the construction of new
large-scale installations is no longer viable. This ‘overhang’ of cer-
tiﬁcates and the devaluation of RECs was noted by 18 respondents.
large-scale renewable energy by
While the crowding-out of
excessive small-scale generation was remedied through the sepa-
ration of the RET into the LRET and SRES, with separate GWh targets
and certiﬁcate types, the REC overhang still exists, with many re-
tailers still stockpiling enough RECs to meet obligations out to
2015/2016, essentially stalling investment in large-scale generation
for the period between 2011 and 2015/16.

Kent and Mercer [6] found that mandating of particular tech-
nologies (through multiple certiﬁcates and excess quotas) was near
unanimously opposed in submissions to the Tambling Review, as it
was deemed as a way of ‘picking winners’ in regards to technology
types as opposed to allowing the most economically efﬁcient
technologies to advance. Claims by small-scale renewable energy
industry in the media that the Solar Credits Multiplier was required
to promote the installation of systems and support the small-scale
industry [32] were ultimately off-set by responses to the Issues
Paper that the Solar Credits Multiplier was inefﬁcient and resulted
in unnecessarily high increases in electricity tariffs. Ross et al. [3]
noted that renewable energy policies that generate high levels of
industry growth over the short-term, but cannot be sustained
ﬁnancially, undermine long-term industry development. Further-
more, Valentine [33] indicated that the Solar Credits Multiplier was
harmful to the renewable energy sector in that it allowed small-
scale systems to outcompete utility-scale development. The Solar
Credits Multiplier then proved all these assertions correct: it was

shown to increase the demand for small-scale solar photovoltaic
systems to the extent that economies of scale were achieved, but it
was also found to have negative, cascading effects across the
renewable energy market and to all electricity consumers. That 87%
of respondents referring to this line of question (N ¼ 68) either
rejected the use of multipliers (or banding) in future, and/or noted
the negative impacts of the Solar Credits Multiplier to the scheme,
indicates that the Solar Credits Multiplier was ultimately delete-
rious to the RET scheme. Approximately 19% of respondents sup-
ported the use of multipliers (or banding), and then only in speciﬁc
cases where generation of certiﬁcates was likely to be low, with
many of these respondents also noting that the Solar Credits
Multiplier had resulted in undesirable outcomes in the RET.

4.3.4.

Incumbent support for other technology types

There was considerable criticism within Issues Paper sub-
missions regarding the inclusion of two additional support mech-
anisms for technologies. The inclusion of waste coal mine gas
received particular criticism from respondents,
in particular
because this is not an ‘ecologically sustainable’ renewable energy
source, as is stipulated in the RET legislation. The inclusion of waste
coal mine gas is as a result of the harmonisation of jurisdictional
targets prior to the 2009 expansion of the RET [1], including New
South Wales’ support for waste coal mine gas. As only waste coal
mine gas generation systems built in New South Wales during its
target scheme are supported competitive inequity exists between
generators wanting to utilise waste coal mine gas. 64% of the re-
spondents to this line of questioning (N ¼ 42) explicitly requested
its removal from the RET, with only two respondents requesting
that new waste coal mine gas be capable of generating certiﬁcates
under the RET. The remainder of respondents all proposed main-
taining the current arrangements, to provide on-going support to
existing facilities or simply to ensure that the legislative framework
remained unchanged.

The inclusion of technologies that do not generate electricity but
may displace the use of electricity e so-called displacement tech-
nologies e was an area of contention within submissions, with 42%
of respondents to this line of questioning supporting displacement
technologies’ removal from the scheme, and 39% supporting its
expansion to other technology types (N ¼ 31). The 2001 MRET
included support for small-scale solar water heaters and heat pump
in these
water heaters as a way of promoting investment

manufacturing industries in Australia [34]. While the majority of
these systems are now imported into Australia the legacy of sup-
porting this industry, particularly in light of its contribution to
energy efﬁcient technology uptake, has led to the view that support
for this industry is still useful. The inclusion of solar water heaters
and heat pump water heaters in the RET continues to be conten-
tious, not only for the fact that these are not renewable electricity
generation resources, but also because new displacement tech-
nologies, in particular cogeneration and ground source heat pumps,
are not included in the RET.

The lack of alternative schemes to appropriately support waste
coal mine gas generation and displacement technologies, and
continuing concern that the carbon pricing mechanism may prove
inadequate or be revoked, led the Climate Change Authority to
recommend retaining both mechanisms, with the outcome that
inequity will continue to exist between waste coal mine gas gen-
erators and elements of the displacement industry.

Lindblom’s [35]

‘disjointed incrementalism’, where policy-
makers pursue a limited range of well-analysed policy alterna-
tives, is particularly relevant in this case, which sees an inherently
conservative approach to policy-making preferred. Kent and
Mercer [6] found this policy development technique was typiﬁed in
the development of the former Liberal (conservative) Govern-
ment’s MRET. Consistent with the incremental policy development
process, the Liberal Australian Government’s response to the
Tambling Review’s ﬁndings had emphasised a ‘business-as-usual’
policy framework, with fossil-fuel continuing to dominate the en-
ergy sector in future. In this case the Climate Change Authority has
also favoured a ‘business-as-usual’ policy framework that favours
both the incumbent renewable generators, but also support
mechanisms that may not serve the objectives of the RET to provide
least-cost renewable generation.

4.4. Climate change authority review recommendations and
government response

On completing the consultation process, the Climate Change
Authority produced a Final Review Report that included 34 rec-
ommendations for the Australian Government’s consideration [1].
Of these 34 recommendations, 18 supported the existing scheme,
ﬁve recommended further review, consultation or assessment and
11 proposed changes to the scheme (Table 3). Of these 11 only six

were accepted outright, with three of these accepted recommen-
dations covering minor administrative components of the scheme
[8]. The key recommendation accepted by the Australian Govern-
ment conﬁrmed that the periodical review process would be un-
dertaken only once every four years. The other recommendation
with appreciable effects on the renewable energy industry related
to the decision to reduce the deeming of certiﬁcates from 15 years,
however this will not come into effect until 2017.

The review process therefore supported relatively incremental
changes to the policy. Given no great changes have been suggested
to promote increased uptake of renewable energy, or conversely to
provide additional support for electricity consumers suffering un-
der the burden of the RET, the review process is likely to have
caused more harm than good purely by introducing a perception of
policy uncertainty. While the outcomes of the review process
suggest that the Climate Change Authority has taken heed of the
advice from industry to minimise changes to the scheme, and the
Australian Government has gone one step further to maintain the
status quo within the Scheme, there may be value in determining
whether the Review should have been undertaken at all, particu-
larly given the Australian Government’s apparent preference for
maintaining the status quo in the majority of review processes.

The case of the 2012 Climate Change Authority Review of the
RET, and the Australian Government’s response, could therefore be
considered ‘choreographed consultation’. Cheeseman and Smith
[36] found that a consultative policy-development process resulted
in little actual inﬂuence on policy direction, but that the consulta-
tion process garnered support for policies already in train. If any-
thing, the RET review process allowed the Australian Government
to cite support from a variety of stakeholders, including industry
and the general public, with regard to the implementation of pol-
icies to support renewable energy in Australia. In doing so, the
Australian Government was able to rebuke claims from industry
that it would be in Australian consumers’ best interests to support a
decrease to the 45,000 GWh target.

5. Conclusion

The submissions to the RET Issues Paper demonstrate that
while the RET mechanism is increasing the penetration of
renewable technologies within Australia, and stakeholders,
including industry and the general public, are largely supportive of
the Scheme, there are misgivings about some elements of the
operation of the Scheme. Primarily, stakeholders perceive that the
RET would be more successful if it was devoted to least-cost
renewable technologies, and therefore sub-schemes that favour
technology types should not be included under the Scheme. The
overwhelming conclusion that can be drawn from the sub-
missions, however, is that uncertainty within the policy environ-
ment remains the key threat to meeting the RET scheme Target.
This uncertainty is felt through the unknown interaction between
the RET and the carbon pricing mechanism, the frequent intro-
duction of review processes that undermine investment certainty
and the interaction between state-based policies and the renew-
able energy industry. The necessity of ensuring a set GWh target
for the RET, and providing conﬁdence to investors that this will
not be amended, regardless of future potential review processes,
cannot be overstated. While the Climate Change Authority’s
recommendation to maintain the current GWh target, and in-
crease the time between reviews from two years to four years,
goes some way to increasing conﬁdence within the renewable
energy industry, the potential renegotiation of the target and re-
review of the Scheme should the Australian Government change
hands in September 2013, undermines these efforts. In order for
there to be true conﬁdence in the Target, bipartisan support of the

RET, and implementation of all agreed recommendations of the
Climate Change Authority, is required.

Distributional effects

The Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) has spurred signiﬁcant investment in renewable
electricity generation, notably wind power, over the past decade. This paper considers distributional
implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the
increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity
prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers
in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our ﬁndings highlight likely signiﬁcant redistributive
transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some
energy-intensive industries are beneﬁting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely
exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying
signiﬁcant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily beneﬁting from lower wholesale prices. A more
equitable distribution of RET costs and beneﬁts could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of
industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in
regulated electricity tariffs reﬂect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these ﬁndings
support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional
assessments into policy design and implementation.

Introduction

Australia implemented the world's ﬁrst national Mandatory
Renewable Energy Target (MRET) based around green certiﬁcate
trading in 2001. The original target of an additional 9500 GWh of
‘new’ renewable generation each year by 2010 was comfortably
achieved with contributions from biomass, hydro, solar and,
most particularly, wind deployment. Amendments to the scheme
undertaken in 2009–10 with bipartisan political support, have
established the goal of deriving the equivalent of at least 20 per

cent of Australian electricity from renewable sources by 2020
(Australian Government, 2012). In 2011, the target was split into
two parts with separate targets, the Large-Scale Renewable Energy
Target (LRET) covering utility scale renewable projects, and the
Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) covering residential
solar. In this paper, we focus on the LRET and associated invest-
ment in (predominantly) wind energy.1

1 The SRES and the associated build-up of distributed photovoltaic electricity
generation in Australia is likely to also have non-negligible distributional effects,
the estimation of which is also impacted by the various State-based feed-in-tariffs
that supported PV's initial deployment (Nelson et al., 2011). Furthermore, the
amount of self-generated solar energy consumed by households owning rooftop PV
also plays a role (Cai et al., 2013).

The RET places a legal obligation on entities that purchase
electricity on the wholesale market to surrender a certain amount
of green certiﬁcates each year in proportion to their market share.
The liable parties are mainly retailers (also known as suppliers and
Load Service Entities in some other industries) and a few large
electricity consumers that directly purchase electricity on the
wholesale market. Each certiﬁcate represents 1 MWh of electricity
generated by ‘new’ (that is, not pre-existing hydro) renewable
energy sources. These Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs) can be
created by accredited large-scale renewable energy projects, gen-
erating LGCs (and small-scale renewable energy systems for the
SRES). RECs provide the additional revenue stream, beyond energy
market returns, that is required to implement renewable energy
projects. There is an active market between liable parties and
certiﬁcate providers for these RECs with associated spot and
forward prices that vary according to renewable energy project
costs and electricity prices.

Since its inception the RET has driven considerable investment
in renewable energy projects, and an increasing percentage of
electricity consumption is now being provided from new renew-
able generation (Fig. 1). This expansion of electricity generated by
renewables has several competing impacts on electricity prices in
the short run. On the one hand, an increased penetration of
renewables in wholesale electricity markets tends to lower the
spot price. This is due to the so-called merit order effect by which
renewables that have close to zero short run marginal costs
displace higher operating cost generation and hence lower the
overall price required for supply to meet demand within the
wholesale electricity market (see Section 2).

On the other hand, the cost of green certiﬁcates, reﬂecting the
additional investment costs of renewable generation, is added to
the retail price of electricity by the retailer who passes the costs of
complying with their target on to consumers, or is paid for directly
by users who manage their own compliance. Besides a wholesale
component and renewable energy scheme charges, residential
retail prices also include charges for transmission and distribution
networks. These network costs are, indeed, the major cost com-

components for transmission networks of 8% and distribution

networks of 37%, a wholesale component including carbon costs
of 37% and a retail component of 17% that included an allowance
for LRET and SRES costs of 3–4% (Fig. 2).

Our analysis focuses on those components of retail prices
which are directly affected by the RET in the short term, namely
the wholesale component and green scheme charges. We do not
consider transmission or distribution network charges in the
analysis. Instead, the aim of this paper is to investigate how the
potential ﬁnancial beneﬁts of the RET (lower wholesale prices in
the short run) and its costs (increased retail prices due to the cost
of green certiﬁcates) are distributed amongst different groups of
electricity consumers, and how design choices about the imple-
mentation of the RET affect this distribution.
In particular, a
number of so-called energy-intensive trade-exposed industries
are largely exempt from contributing to the costs of the RET, while
they could still beneﬁt from the reduction in wholesale prices
driven by the scheme. The importance of this question has been
noted by some stakeholders. For example, in their submission to
the review of the RET, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory
Tribunal of New South Wales notes: “As the overall RET target is
kept constant, these exemptions raise the costs of complying with
the scheme for all other customers, particularly as the exempted
industries can be large users of electricity and account for a
signiﬁcant proportion of electricity use in Australia. To date, little
analysis has been publicly provided on the impact of these
exemptions including the costs and beneﬁts to other electricity
customers.” (IPART, 2012b, p. 11). The Climate Institute (2012) has
also raised concerns regarding these wealth transfers.

Furthermore, this issue has been raised in some other jurisdic-

Germany and its Renewable Energy Support Act (EEG). The EEG
also exempts energy-intensive companies from contributing to the
cost of the policy. In their paper Cludius et al. (2013) conclude that
the merit order effect likely overcompensates energy-intensive
consumers by a factor of twenty for their contribution to the cost
of the EEG. This, therefore, makes the scheme more costly than it
might otherwise be for households and small business.

We expect that the Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET)
has also led to potentially signiﬁcant distributional transfers
between households and large electricity consumers. As noted

above, a large share of industrial consumption is currently partially
exempt from complying with the RET. Furthermore, ﬁnancial RET
beneﬁts to end-users – lower wholesale prices – may not be
completely passed forward to households through the process of
setting retail tariffs by regulators. Analysing and addressing dis-
tributional effects can play a key role in achieving broad social
consensus on the fairness and hence appropriateness of policy
implementation (United Nations, 2006). As an example, the
Australian Government introduced a large household assistance
programme alongside its introduction of a carbon price with the
explicit intent of addressing potentially adverse distributional
impacts arising from the policy, particularly on vulnerable house-
holds (Australian Government, 2011).

Distributional issues, however, did not seem to feature greatly
in public discussions regarding the design and implementation of
the extended RET (MacGill and Passey, 2009). More recently,
however, major rises in retail electricity prices have focussed
greater public attention on cost drivers within the industry. Most
of these price increases have been driven by growing distribution
network expenditure. However, renewable energy policy support
including the RET has also contributed and raised questions of
overall schemes costs and also their distribution. Discussions are
set to intensify in the future as LRET costs are expected to rise, as a
result of both the progressively increasing level of the target
(obligations on retailers to source their electricity from renewable
sources are currently expected to more than double over the next
six years)2 and rising LGC prices due to higher ﬁnancing costs for
renewables projects (IPART, 2013). Furthermore, an abolition of the
carbon price and an associated fall in wholesale electricity prices
would also be expected to drive up prices for LGCs. Finally, results
of this study not only have implications for the RET, but also, more
generally, for ongoing discussions about the potential need and
possible nature of reform of both electricity wholesale and retail
markets in Australia.

The paper is structured as follows. We ﬁrst present the method
and data for estimation of the merit order effect of wind energy in

the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We also discuss
the market for Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates, reﬂecting the costs
of the RET and point out existing exemptions from the RET. Finally,
we present a framework for determining the net impact of the RET
on electricity prices. Section 3 presents regression results of the
reduction in wholesale prices caused by the merit order effect of
wind in the Australian NEM in 2011–12 and 2012–13. We use
these results together with information on RET costs in regulated
retail tariffs to derive impacts of the RET on retail electricity prices
for a range of pass-through rates for both the reduction in whole-
sale prices and RET costs. Section 4 discusses potential effects for
individual electricity consumers and how these are related to the
retail tariffs they receive. Finally, Section 5 highlights the potential
policy implications of these ﬁndings and concludes.

National Electricity Market (NEM)

The expansion of renewable generation in the NEM, in particular
the large growth in wind capacity since the inception of policies
promoting renewable generation, has had a notable inﬂuence on
the price of wholesale electricity. As with any additional supply, the
expansion of wind generation has placed downward pressure on
wholesale prices. However, this phenomenon is more pronounced
in the case of wind generation due to the fact that it has a very low
short run marginal cost. This systematic correlation between spot
price and wind generation in the short run is known as the merit
order effect of wind generation.

The supply curve, or merit order, within a wholesale electricity
market is constructed by ordering the bids of all generators from
lowest to highest. In a scenario where no market power exists
these bids should equate to the marginal costs of the generators
and therefore the supply curve reﬂect the aggregate marginal cost
curve for the market. At the intersection of the supply and demand
curves, the spot market price is set. All generators with lower marginal
costs receive this uniform price and serve demand over the period of
the wholesale spot market, which lasts half an hour in the NEM. Wind
tends to shift the supply curve to the right, due to its low marginal cost

of generation. This is called the merit order effect (see Forrest and
MacGill, 2013 for an in-depth discussion of the merit order effect).3

The merit order effect is a well-documented phenomenon (IEA,
2011). In general, two ways of estimating the effect exist. The ﬁrst
approach uses an electricity market model which compares two
scenarios, one with and one without the inclusion of renewables
and looks at the difference in resulting electricity wholesale prices
(de Miera et al., 2008; Sensfuß et al., 2008; Weigt, 2009). The
second approach uses time-series analysis of historical price and
load data (Cludius et al., 2013; Forrest and MacGill, 2013; Gelabert
et al., 2011; Jónsson et al., 2010; Woo et al., 2011). While the
speciﬁcation of an electricity market model has the potential to
capture longer term effects, it requires careful calibration of a
counterfactual scenario and available market models generally
have signiﬁcant limitations. Time-series analysis, on the other
hand, does not have to make assumptions about alternative
developments, but can only analyse short term effects, neglecting
issues such as investment costs in new generation or networks. It
may also struggle to resolve the impact of renewables against a
wide range of other potential market drivers. Some techniques can
include elements of both approaches (McConnell et al., 2013). See
Würzburg et al. (2013) for a review of studies on the merit order
effect to date.

forward market,

The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) includes the
states of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia
and Tasmania (the Australian Capital Territory is included in the
NSW region of the NEM). It covers around 90% of Australia's
population and electricity demand. The wholesale spot market is
unique in that it is ‘energy only’ with no capacity market or
technical
is compulsory (gross pool) for all
generators larger than 30 MW, uses ﬁve minute dispatch with
30 minute averaged pricing, requires participants to manage their
own unit commitment and allows participants to rebid their price-
quantity offers on a ﬁve minute basis (MacGill, 2010). The NEM
spot market is characterised by its extremely volatile prices by
comparison with many other markets and during the study period
operated under a market ceiling price in any half hour
of $12,900/MWh and a market ﬂoor price of (cid:3) $1000/MWh.
At present, each of the regions in the NEM has only limited
interconnection with other regions and therefore each region has
its own dynamic wholesale price (AER, 2012).

The calculation builds on Forrest and MacGill (2013) who
calculate the merit order effect between 2009 and 2011 for South
Australia and Victoria. We extend this analysis by calculating the
merit order effect for the NEM as a whole for the two years 2011–
12 and 2012–13. The wholesale price in the NEM is modelled as a
the feed-in of wind (windt) and total demand
function of

3 Note that depending on the way in which renewable generation is included
in the electricity market, it might also be represented as a reduction in demand.
The overall effect in this stylised model, however, is identical.

account of the fact that the effect of wind is expected to be higher
at the high demand end. Dummy variables for seasonal trends on a
daily timescale and a binary variable for weekends is also
included. To account for transient changes, an autoregressive term
is included in the model (Eq. (1)).

We use half-hourly data on wholesale spot prices, demand and
wind aggregated across the ﬁve regions of the NEM. The data was
extracted from the database located on the Australia Energy Market
Operator (AEMO) website (www.aemo.com.au). A national wholesale
spot price variable was created using a demand weighted average of
the regional prices (Table 1) while demand and wind were added
across regions (Table 2). For each of the data series used in the analysis
the Phillips–Perron test for stationarity was conducted and all series
were found to be stationary as expected, thus alleviating the concern
of spurious regression results.

At high levels of demand, price spikes can be observed that do not
correspond to marginal costs and are the result of a lack of competi-
tion in these situations (Twomey and Neuhoff, 2010). Therefore, the
spot price variable has been censored to between the values of
1 $/MWh and 415 $/MWh, reﬂecting a reasonable estimate of the
lowest and highest short run marginal costs of generators in the NEM.
Consequently, the estimate of the merit order effect can be considered
to be representative of ‘standard’ conditions in the market and not
those periods effected by extremely low and high price events. It is
expected that this approach leads to a more conservative estimate of
the merit order effects due to the asymmetric magnitude and
frequency of low and high price events. Further, by taking a national
approach, we determine an estimate of the merit order effect of the
NEM as a whole, and neglect potential interregional differences and
interconnection effects.

Average half-hourly demand was about 400 MW lower in 2012–13
than in 2011–12, which can be explained by a range of reasons, such as
weather conditions, a rising share of distributed energy sources and

industrial shutdowns (IES, 2013). Average electricity generated by
wind increased by 100 MW. Wholesale spot electricity prices, how-
ever, nearly doubled between 2011–12 and 2012–13. The main driver
of this difference is the introduction of the ﬁxed carbon price in July
2012, and, to a lesser extent, the fact that moderate weather conditions
and signiﬁcant hydro availability coupled with falling demand and
increased feed-in of renewables made 2011–12 a year of historically
low wholesale prices. Retail prices rose by 15% between the two years,
with the wholesale component including the carbon price being
responsible for 38% of this price rise, and rising transmission and
distribution network costs for 43% (AEMC, 2013b).

2.2. The market for Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs), RET costs
and exemptions

Each year, liable parties under the RET – that is, those that
make “relevant acquisitions of electricity” – have to submit a
mandated number of certiﬁcates. In practice these liable parties
are mostly retailers, although there are some end-users that
acquire their obligation directly from renewable energy projects
(Climate Change Authority, 2012). The exact number of certiﬁcates
to be submitted is determined by the Renewable Power Percen-
tage (RPP), which is applied to the amount of electricity bought by
each liable party. The percentage is set at a level that ensures the
20% target of the RET will be reached in 2020. The shortfall charge
is set at 65 $/MWh. As certiﬁcate purchases are tax deductible,
while the shortfall charge is not, the penalty is larger in real terms.
Each Renewable Energy Certiﬁcate (REC) represents 1 MWh of
electricity generated by accredited renewable energy projects. Fig. 3
shows the evolution of spot prices for Large-scale Generation Certiﬁ-
cates (LGCs) for the time period under investigation. LGC prices have
fallen from around $40 in mid-2011 to below $35 in mid-2013.
In theory, certiﬁcate prices should reﬂect the difference between the
price of electricity that can be earned on the wholesale market and the
long run marginal cost of the most economically efﬁcient renewable
generation technology. The price is, however, also inﬂuenced by
political events impacting the current and expected stringency of
renewable energy policy. Nelson et al. (2013) note that prices have
generally been lower than this expected difference. This is mainly due
to uncertainty regarding the future of the RET and an oversupply of
permits that occurred due to a multiplier for credits generated by

small-scale solar, which had been introduced in 2009 when the target
was expanded. This oversupply was one of the reasons for splitting the
target into the two different components in 2011.

Two types of exemptions from liability under the RET exist: (i) self-
consumption and (ii) Emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry
(EITE). Since the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) and therefore
the impact of RET costs on electricity prices depends on the total liable
electricity consumption, the more exemptions, the more expensive the
scheme becomes for the non-exempt parties: “The broader the base
for liability, the smaller the impact for any individual liable party. For
it is generally more efﬁcient and equitable to keep
this reason,
exemptions to a minimum.” (Climate Change Authority, 2012)

The original MRET had a clearly articulated principle that energy
consumers should pay according to their consumption (Tambling,
2003). However, exemption provisions were introduced together with
the expansion of the RET in 2009 and took effect in 2010. Eligible
activities can apply for partial exemption certiﬁcates (PECs). PECs
remove RET liability for the volume of electricity (in MWh) which is
speciﬁed in the PEC. Those PECs are then passed on from the exempt
user to their retailer under the assumption that the retailer then has
lower liability and passes only a fraction of RET costs on to the EITE
activity.

The rationale behind exempting certain industries is that some
industries compete within an international market and thus may
not be able to pass RET costs on to consumers in the form of higher
prices. Consumers might, instead, substitute their product with
one produced by a company that does not face environmental
regulations in their country. Furthermore, industry might decide
to relocate to jurisdictions with less stringent environmental
regulation. This process of shifting greenhouse related emissions
abroad is called ‘carbon leakage’. The true extent of carbon leakage
depends on both the emissions- and trade-intensity of
the
industry in question and other barriers that might impede reloca-
tion of production or substitution of consumption, such as trans-
portation costs or local factors (Dröege et al., 2009; European
Commission, 2010).

The list of EITE activities that qualify for RET exemption is the
same as for exemptions from the Australian carbon price. Highly
emissions-intensive activities include aluminium and zinc smelt-
ing, petroleum reﬁning, the manufacture of iron and steel and the
manufacture of newsprint. They are exempt from 90% of RET costs.

Moderately emissions-intensive activities include the manufacture
of wood, paper and glass products, as well as certain chemical
processes and are exempt for 60% of their electricity consumption.
In 2011, 27.5 TWh of electricity consumption were exempt from
paying for RET costs, mostly at a 90% rate, while in 2012 33.5 TWh
were exempt, which corresponds to about 15% of total electricity
consumption in Australia. 65% of these exemptions were granted
to the aluminium industry (Table 3).4

2.3. Estimating the net impact of the RET on electricity prices

The net effect of

the RET on electricity prices faced by
consumers in the short run depends on the pass-through of both
the merit order effect and the certiﬁcate cost. We estimate
indicative net effects for nine combinations of possible pass-
through rates as illustrated in Table 4. Analysed pass-through
rates of RET costs range from 100% to 10%, corresponding to the
exemption rates (0% for households and small business; 60% or
90% for energy-intensive industry), while the pass-through effect
of the merit order effect is analysed at indicative levels of 0%, 50%
and 100% (representing a case where electricity prices are not,
partially or fully aligned to wholesale price movements).

Pass-through of the merit order effect to an individual con-
sumer depends on whether or not retail prices or tariffs are
aligned to wholesale price movements. The extent to which this
is the case is expected to depend on (i) whether a user is subject to
a regulated retail tariff or has the ability to negotiate their own
contract and, in case the user is on a retail tariff, (ii) the method by
which the wholesale energy purchase cost allowance is calculated
by the regulator in the user's jurisdiction.

The pass-through of RET costs is likely to primarily depend on
the extent of exemption from RET costs of the individual con-
sumer, therefore, we analyse pass-through of RET costs at 10%
(exempt industry, high exemption), 40% (exempt industry, med-
ium exemption) and 100% (no exemption, households and small
business).
the
approach taken by the regulator to determine the green scheme
allowance will again play a role.

In jurisdictions with regulated retail prices,

3. Results

3.1. The impact of the RET on prices in the Australian National
Electricity Market (NEM)

This section presents results of the regression model for the
two years 2011–12 and 2012–13 respectively (Tables 5 and 6).
The years were analysed separately due to the introduction of the
carbon price and its impact on wholesale prices. In order to
account for the fact that the data has been censored a Tobit model
has been used to estimate the parameter coefﬁcients in the model.
Furthermore, due to the possible presence of serial correlation,

4 Exemptions are not granted for the MRET share of the RET, i.e. for the ﬁrst
9500 GWh everyone is fully liable. If this provision was removed, it would add
another 0.36 $/MWh to RET costs for remaining liable parties (Climate Change
Authority, 2012).

statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by looking at the maximum of
standard errors from the Tobit model and an OLS model with
Newey–West standard errors.

All coefﬁcients are estimated highly precisely and have the
expected sign, i.e. additional generation by wind has a negative
impact on the electricity price, while additional demand has a
positive impact. The coefﬁcients can be used to estimate the expected
price reduction at a speciﬁc wind output. From these results, it is
possible to develop an estimate of the total merit order effect, i.e. the
average price reduction by calculating the volume weighted average
price difference over the analysis period (see Forrest and MacGill
(2013) for further information on the estimation strategy).

This represents a short run estimate of the merit order effect, as
it does not take into account long run changes in generation
capacity due to additional wind generation. The estimate of the
merit order effect in 2012–13 is higher by approximately $1/MWh.
This is a result of higher wind penetration and the introduction of
the carbon price leading to higher operating costs of the marginal
generation that wind displaces.5

3.2. RET costs in regulated retail tariffs

Retailers pass the costs incurred by purchasing Renewable Energy
Certiﬁcates (RECs) on to consumers in the form of higher electricity
prices.6 In jurisdictions where retail prices are regulated, regulators
have to set a green scheme allowance for prices to be set by the
retailer. In order to determine the green scheme allowance, jurisdic-
tions apply the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) in a given year to
the expected Large-scale Generation Certiﬁcate (LGC) price. Jurisdic-
tions use different approaches to estimate the expected LGC price.
Some base their estimations on the observed prices of LGCs on the
market (Queensland, the ACT and Tasmania) while others use an
electricity market model to derive the least cost option of reaching
RET targets (New South Wales, South Australia).

LRET allowances for retail prices set in 2011–12 and 2012–13 in
the different State and Territory jurisdictions are shown in Table 7.
For New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and
the ACT, allowances shown are those set by the respective
regulator for regulated retail tariffs. The retail electricity market
is deregulated in Victoria, but retailers have to publish a standing
offer price, which the Australian Electricity Market Commission
(AEMC, 2013b) uses to calculate an indicative component of LRET
costs in retail prices.

As an indicator for LRET costs, a volume-weighted average
using residential electricity consumption by State from ESAA
(2013) of the allowance for LRET costs in regulated retail tariffs
(Table 7) is calculated at 3.38 $/MWh in 2011–12 and 5.29 $/MWh
in 2012–13. This estimate represents LRET costs for households
and small business, as covered by regulated retail tariffs. It has to
be noted that cost recovery in a regulated electricity tariff may
overstate the costs of green certiﬁcates and not represent compe-
titive market prices. Indeed, some of the approaches used by NEM
jurisdictions to determine this allowance have led to estimated
LRET certiﬁcate prices that are considerably higher than the
observed spot market price. Therefore, LRET costs for industry

5 While our analysis focusses on the effect of the Large-scale RET and
associated wind generation, the recent rise in photovoltaic generation installed in
the NEM (as a result of the SRES and State-based feed-in tariffs) is also expected to
have considerable merit order effects (cf. McConnell et al., 2013, who model the
hypothetical impact of 5 GW of distributed photovoltaic generation installed in the
NEM in 2009 to 2010).

6 Therefore, in a concentrated market like Australia, retailers generally do not
have an incentive to minimise RET costs. That is why some large users would like to
opt into the scheme and manage their liabilities directly (Climate Change Authority,
2012).

Table 8 displays indicative net effects per MWh for the different
combinations of pass-through rates. Our results for 2011–12 and
2012–13 indicate that individual consumers situated in the upper
left-hand corner with high pass-through rates of RET cost and low
pass-through rates of the merit order effect faced net costs, while
individual electricity consumers that were shielded from RET costs
and see high pass-through of merit order effects are likely to have
experienced net beneﬁts. Costs for remaining consumers could have
been reduced if those consumers experiencing net beneﬁts from
the policy contributed to a larger extent to the cost of the RET.

Larger effects in 2012–13 can both be attributed to the expan-
sion of wind capacity and the introduction of the carbon price,
which increased the marginal cost of electricity generation

displaced by wind and therefore merit order effects (see Section 3.1),
as well as higher LGC prices in regulated retail tariffs as used in
this analysis. In general, higher wholesale prices should lead to
lower prices for renewable certiﬁcates. This is the case, because
the certiﬁcate price covers the cost difference between what can
be earned on the electricity market by a renewable generator
and what it costs to build it. However, regulator estimations for
renewable certiﬁcates were increased between 2011–12 and 2012–
13, since alternative assumptions regarding the cost of capital
(WACC) were applied. This is partly due to uncertainty surrounding
the political future of renewable energy policy in Australia (cf. Nelson
et al., 2013).

Overall, estimated merit order effects in 2011–12 and 2012–13
are not high enough to fully compensate every electricity con-
sumer for their cost contribution to the RET. However, merit order
effects do have the potential to signiﬁcantly reduce RET costs if
they are passed forward to consumers. Note that this effect might
not hold in the long run, as the effect of increased renewable
generation on wholesale electricity prices in the long run depends
on its effect on investment and divestment decisions in the
electricity industry and, more generally, future electricity market
design.

4. Discussion

As stated above, the net effect of the RET on an individual
consumer, i.e. their position on Table 8, is likely to depend on
certain consumer characteristics. In this section we explore further
consumer characteristics that inﬂuence (i) the pass-through of
merit order effects and (ii) the pass-through of RET costs and the
role of regulators in those jurisdictions with regulated retail prices.

4.1. Pass-through of merit order effects

The pass-through of merit order effects depends on the extent
to which electricity prices of consumers are aligned to wholesale
prices. Large users typically obtain negotiated and often tailored
contracts with retailers within the competitive market. These
tailored contracts may include signiﬁcantly longer time periods
than the standard one to three year contracts for small customers
and can potentially include varying levels of wholesale spot price
exposure depending on the energy user's particular requirements,
risk appetite and load curtailment opportunities. The contracts are
often based on forward prices. However, forward prices should
generally respond to merit order effects as well, as otherwise
arbitrage between the two contracts would be possible (Sensfuß,
2011). At present, future wholesale prices are generally ﬂat or even
lower than current spot prices as market participants expect a
reduction or elimination of the carbon price.

Residential and small business consumers, on the other hand,
are subject to regulated or competitive market offers from retai-
lers. Determinations of regulated tariffs are available online from
the regulatory authority in each State. Information for contracts for
small consumers that are not on a regulated tariff is hard to obtain.
The AEMC notes that unregulated contracts for small consumers
“will generally be lower than regulated or standing offers” (AEMC,
2013b p. 23).

Generally, two different approaches are used by regulators to
determine the wholesale component of a regulate tariff: (i) a Long
run marginal cost (LRMC) approach and (ii) a market-based
approach. The LRMC can be modelled using a number of different
approaches, including the standalone approach, the average incre-
mental cost (AIC) approach and the perturbation (or Turvey)
approach. The standalone approach assumes that no generation
capacity currently exists and therefore, that demand is met by
constructing new generation capacity in a least cost manner to
meet the demand. The standalone approach is popular amongst
regulators in Australia due to its relative simplicity and because it
can be readily applied to different demand proﬁles. In particular,
its applicability to different demand proﬁles means that the LRMC
can be calculated for customers for individual distribution areas
using their respective load proﬁles.

The AIC and perturbation approach both utilise electricity
market investment models to produce estimates of the LRMC.
The AIC approach estimates the LRMC by determining the average
costs of meeting all future increases in demand. The AIC can be
volatile or possibly undeﬁned when future demand is not strictly
increasing. The perturbation approach estimates the LRMC in a
given year by ‘perturbing’ demand with a permanent increase and
ﬁnding the average costs to meet this perturbation.

Market-based energy purchase costs are estimated by forecast-
ing spot and contract prices and then estimating an effective
hedging strategy for the load that the respective retailers serve.
Alternatively, a hedging strategy can be applied to observed prices
in the futures market. From this the total costs of purchasing
electricity are calculated as the cost of purchasing a hedged
position in the market.

The different modelling strategies applied by the regulators in
New South Wales and Queensland in 2011–12 and 2012–13 are
summarised in Table 9. Generally, energy purchase cost results are
higher using a standalone LRMC approach than a market-based
approach. One reason for this difference is that each approach to
estimating the LRMC implicitly incorporates the merit order effect
to a different extent and the extent is often driven by the
assumptions used in undertaking the modelling, in particular the
treatment of
the Renewable Energy Target. The standalone
approach, as it is typically applied, does not include the effect of
renewable generation on price. Typical modelling using the
standalone approach assumes that demand must be met by a
mix of coal- and gas-ﬁred generation and ignores renewable

generation sources, such as wind, as they are not cost competitive
in the absence of the RET (Frontier Economics, 2011). In their
review on best practice retail price methodology, the AEMC
(2013a) notes that a perturbation LRMC method produces “useful
insights” into the interaction between the LRET and the wholesale
electricity price, while the AIC and standalone methods are less
likely to do so (p.38). Since the electricity market hedging model
used for the market-based approach is calibrated to the NEM, it
does take into account generation by renewable energy sources
and therefore incorporates the impact of the merit order effect of
renewable generation (e.g. Frontier Economics, 2011).7

Fig. 4 illustrates the impact different pass-through rates of the
merit order effect had on indicative net effects for residential or
small business consumers in 2011–12 and 2012-13. These con-
sumers are expected to face full RET costs, illustrated by the top
bars. However, net costs can be reduced signiﬁcantly, when the
reduction of wholesale prices, caused by increased wind genera-
is passed through to consumers. Therefore, methods of
tion,
calculating the wholesale component in regulated retail prices
that are likely to capture merit order effects are expected to reduce

7 Although both the perturbation LRMC approach and market-based methods
using future prices are considered to be efﬁcient estimates of future wholesale
electricity costs, estimates might diverge on a year-by-year basis (AEMC, 2013a).
This may have several reasons, including assumptions made in the models, NEM
market design that encourages particular behaviour by incumbents and new
entrants, the fact that the RET is driving generation investment in the absence of
an energy market signal and ﬁnally, falling demand.

the overall cost of the LRET for these small consumers. If the
wholesale component in the regulated tariffs is not reﬂective of
the actual costs of purchasing electricity on the wholesale market
by the retailer, this constitutes an additional proﬁt for retailers,
ﬁnanced by regulated electricity consumers.

Generally,

jurisdictions have moved away from standalone
LRMC towards market-based approaches during the past two
years (Table 10), which may be attributed to the attempt to “place
downward pressure on regulated retail prices” (IPART, 2013 p. 11)
given that “[standalone] LRMC ignores prevailing conditions in the
electricity market, which can be inﬂuenced by a range of factors
and which can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on energy purchase
costs” (QCA, 2012 p. 22). Regulators use both forecast prices and
publicly available future or forward prices in their market-based
energy purchase cost estimates, depending on how liquid they
judge the futures market. The AEMC (2013a) suggests that using
prices observed on the futures market is likely to lead to more
efﬁcient and transparent results and regulators acknowledge that
“the main beneﬁt of using market forward prices over modelled
forward prices is that it is more transparent” (IPART, 2013, p. 60).

4.2. Pass-through of RET costs

The pass-through of RET certiﬁcate costs is likely to mainly
depend on the level of exemption of the individual consumer.
Fig. 5 shows estimated indicative effects for industry that received
90% exemption from RET costs in 2011–12 and 2012–13.

If some of the merit order effect is passed through to these
electricity consumers, they are likely overcompensated for their
contribution to the costs of the RET.
If this contribution was
increased, this would lower the cost for remaining (non-exempt)
consumers. Note that the estimated average LRET costs employed in
this analysis are a weighted-average of the LRET allowance in
regulated tariffs and may therefore be higher than the costs
companies with tailored contracts (or that buy LGCs directly on the
market) actually face. On the other hand, there may be issues with
retailers exerting market power towards exempt consumers and not
compensating them for the whole value of the PEC (AIGN 2012).

For electricity consumers receiving a regulated retail tariff, the
regulator has to estimate a green scheme allowance. In order to do
so, a price forecast for LGCs needs to be made. Again, regulators

have adopted differing methods when estimating the green scheme
allowance in their retail tariffs. New South Wales uses an LRMC
approach (IPART, 2011), while Queensland and the ACT use market-
based approaches (QCA, 2011; ICRC, 2011). To date, estimated LGC
prices have been close to observed market prices (Table 11).8

In their recent review of regulated electricity prices, IPART has
considerably increased the forecast for prices of LGCs. This increase
is mainly due to the application of a higher weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) in the LRMC framework for LGC costs. Table 12
shows estimated LGC costs in the 2011 review and the 2013 review.
Estimated prices are higher than observed spot market prices for
LGCs, which could mean that more than 100% of RET costs are
passed through to regulated electricity consumers.

8 ROAM Consulting (2012) comment on the fact that modelled LGC prices are
generally higher than observed spot market prices. They assume that most LGCs are
contracted through power purchase agreements (80%), while the spot market is
only used for short term liabilities (20%).

5. Conclusions and policy implications

Since its inception in 2001, the Australian Renewable Energy
Target (RET) has spurred considerable investment in renewable
electricity generation. Using time-series regression, we highlight
that the increasing amount of wind energy fed into the NEM has
placed a considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity
prices through the so-called merit order effect.

On the other hand, costs of the RET are passed on to consumers
in the form of higher retail electricity prices through ‘green’
surcharges imposed by retailers who are liable parties under the
scheme. The net impact on a particular energy user depends on a
number of factors. These include whether or not they are largely
exempt from paying for the cost of the RET, and the extent to
which lower wholesale electricity prices are passed through into
retail electricity prices paid by consumers.

Our ﬁndings suggest that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts and costs of the
RET for energy consumers could potentially be more equitably
distributed. While it is impossible to estimate net effects for
individual consumers with certainty, our analysis points to two
key policy implications (i) the potentially large ﬁnancial transfers
between energy users arising from the current level (and extent) of
RET exemptions for some favoured large energy-intensive indus-
tries and (ii) the question to what extent the, perhaps only short
term, beneﬁts of the RET in putting downward pressure on whole-
sale prices are passed through to different energy consumer classes.
Contrasting the estimated reduction in wholesale prices with
the costs of the RET to exempt industries, suggests that some
companies might be currently signiﬁcantly overcompensated for
their contribution to the costs of the RET by the merit order effect
of wind, particularly those exempt from 90% of RET costs. There is
scope for re-examining these assistance rates in light of reduced
wholesale prices due to merit order effects, as a broader liability
base could reduce the cost of the RET for remaining electricity
consumers, and, in particular, households.

Furthermore, when evaluating the impact of the RET on
electricity prices, both its costs, but also its beneﬁts should be
taken into account. At the moment the focus is on RET costs added
to the retail price of electricity. However, the distributional effects
of the RET are likely being worsened at present by regulators not

50

adequately passing on lower spot prices through to residential
households and small businesses on default regulated tariffs due
to their various methodologies for estimating wholesale energy
purchase costs. If retailers passed through more of the reduction in
wholesale prices,
induced at least in part through additional
renewable generation, the overall impact of the RET on retail
electricity prices could be considerably smaller.

There might be a case for removing the regulation of retail
prices in some jurisdictions. However, all consumers including
households and small business already have the right to opt-out of
a regulated tariff and take up a market offer. Some States have
removed default regulated tariffs entirely. However, there are
concerns regarding the level of effective competition being
achieved within competitive retail market arrangements given
the current dominant positions of three major vertically integrated
‘gentailers’ in the NEM. It remains to be seen whether an oligopoly
of retailers would show greater appetite for passing reduced
wholesale prices on to consumers. Therefore, the ﬁrst step could
be for governments to give some guidance on how regulators
could better incorporate reduced wholesale prices due to merit
order effects in retail tariffs, as in the AEMC report on best practice
retail price methodology (AEMC, 2013a).

Finally, the distributional impacts of energy and climate policy are
commonly not a primary focus of policy makers given effectiveness
and efﬁciency objectives. They often only come into view after the
policies have been operating for some period of time. Our analysis
highlights the potential value of considering distributional issues ex-
ante when designing and implementing energy and climate policy,
especially the level and scope of any exemptions offered as ‘so-called’
compensation to particular parties. While there are both environ-
mental and economic reasons for exempting some industries from
complying with the full costs of such policies, regulators have to keep
in mind that any of those exemptions will generally increase the costs
for the non-exempt parties. As such, the estimated distributional
effects are not an inherent feature of the RET or any renewable energy
support policy, but the result of design choices made when imple-
menting the policy.

There exist other dimensions of distributional issues in relation to
renewable energy policies, such as between households of different
income groups (cf. Neuhoff et al., 2013) or between producers and
consumers of electricity (cf. Hirth and Ueckerdt, 2013), which have not
been addressed here. Note, that our study examines short run effects
of renewable energy generation on the wholesale price for electricity.
Whether reduced wholesale prices due to renewable generation are a
long term phenomenon depends on their impact on investment and
divestment decisions in the industry and the future design of
electricity markets. As always, further work is required to better
understand these important issues.

Hydrogen Headstart to power new jobs & industry

Joint media release with

The Hon Chris Bowen MP
Minister for Climate Change and Energy

Senator the Hon Jenny McAllister
Assistant Minister for Climate Change and Energy

The Albanese Government’s second Budget is ensuring Australia can reach its potential as a
renewable energy superpower, with $2 billion for a new Hydrogen Headstart program to scale up
development of Australia’s renewable hydrogen industry.

This critical new investment is all about making Australia a global leader in green hydrogen, as
competition for clean energy investment accelerates around the world.

The net zero transformation is the largest change to both Australia and the world’s economy since
the industrial revolution. After a decade of policy inaction, Hydrogen Headstart contributes to the
over $40 billion of investment by the Albanese Government to make Australia a renewable energy
superpower.

Australia already has the largest pipeline of renewable hydrogen projects in the world. Our regions
have the resources, technical skills and key trade partnerships to drive growth in hydrogen and other
clean industries, as well as the jobs that come with it.

Getting to net zero emissions will require renewable hydrogen. Analysis by ClimateWorks and
ARENA found as much as 364,000 tonnes (44PJ) is required by 2030 and 2,230,000 tonnes
(268PJ) required by 2050 for industrial decarbonisation.

Hydrogen can be combusted for industrial heat, used as a chemical input for green manufacturing, a
fuel for heavy transport, or liquified and compressed for export to our key trading partners.

Green hydrogen is also a critical enabler for future manufacturing of green metals and other
products the world needs as the transformation to net zero by 2050 gathers pace.

The Albanese Government is helping to unlock clean industry growth through:

$2 billion for Hydrogen Headstart, providing revenue support for large‑scale renewable
hydrogen projects through competitive hydrogen production contracts. These will help bridge the
commercial gap for early projects and put Australia on course for up to a gigawatt of electrolyser
capacity by 2030 through 2 to 3 flagship projects.
$38.2 million in funding for a Guarantee of Origin scheme, which will certify renewable energy
and track and verify emissions from clean energy products – in particular hydrogen. This is
critical funding to ensure Australia is seen as an attractive investment destination, to accelerate
investment in an Australian hydrogen industry and to support access to future markets for
verified renewable and clean products.
$2.0 million to establish a fund to support First Nations people and businesses to engage with
hydrogen project proponents, planning processes and program design.

Importantly, the Government will also provide $5.6 million to support further work on the best ways
to leverage Australia’s competitive strengths in renewable energy, critical minerals and highly skilled
workforce to accelerate our other clean industrial and manufacturing capabilities, with further actions
to be identified by the end of 2023.

These commitments build on over half a billion dollars of investment by the Albanese Government in
regional hydrogen hubs, which will drive investments in this new industry across regions including
Gladstone, the Hunter, Bell Bay and the Pilbara.

Developing Australia’s hydrogen industry will help ensure Australia remains a reliable energy partner
to our key regional trading partners through the energy transformation.

This investment will build critical domestic experience and expertise, and help Australia connect to
global supply chains to take advantage of the immense jobs and investment potential of green
hydrogen.

These commitments will build on Australia’s established hydrogen strengths and ensure the regions
that have always powered Australia are well positioned in the global race for clean energy
investment and jobs, securing Australia’s future as a renewable energy superpower.

What’s next for the Renewable Energy Target –
resolving Australia’s integration of energy and
climate change policy?*

Tim Nelson , Tahlia Nolan and Joel Gilmore†

Australian climate change policy and its integration with Australia’s electricity
markets have been fraught for at least two decades. The only enduring policy has been
the Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target (RET). Despite the relative success of
the RET in driving investment and reducing emissions, state governments have now
pivoted towards contracts-for-diﬀerence (Cfds). In this article, we outline the issues
associated with policy discontinuity and the large-scale RET and review its
eﬀectiveness as an emissions reduction tool and driver of electricity sector abatement.
We ﬁnd that the RET has been relatively successful across the key criteria of cost and
emissions reductions and is a better policy instrument than contracts-for-diﬀerence,
which are increasingly being adopted by state governments. Building on the work of
Nelson et al. (2020), we propose a new approach, which would allow for continued use
of Cfds but utilising the RET’s policy architecture.

Key words: electricity market, production subsidy, variable renewable energy.

1. Introduction

Australia has had a haphazard approach to integration of climate change and
energy policy for decades. This is despite Australia having committed to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a manner consistent with a carbon
budget that would limit anthropogenic climate change to no more than two
degree Celsius. The implied carbon budget for Australia to meet this
commitment is a 50% reduction on 2005 emission levels by 2030 (Mein-
shausen et al., 2021) and achieving a 1.5 degrees outcome (which is an
aspirational goal of all governments through the United Nations Convention
on Climate Change: UNFCCC) would require a 75% reduction. It is worth
noting that this is signiﬁcantly greater than the current Commonwealth
Government target of 26–28% by 2030. It can therefore be inferred that
greater emission reduction targets in the future are likely, with international

pressure likely to ‘ratchet up’ commitments by the Australian Government,
for the emissions reduction target through to 2030 and/or for emissions
reduction targets for the post-2030 period.

At the national level, only two policies have materially reduced emissions
within the electricity sector: the Clean Energy Future (carbon pricing)
package, which was introduced on 1 July 2012 but then repealed on 1 July
2014; and the Renewable Energy Target. At the state level, several policies
were utilised prior to the Clean Energy Future package superseding them.
These included the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme (GGAS) and
the Queensland 13% (and subsequently 18%) Gas Scheme. Importantly,
governments have tried and failed to agree on a national approach to an
emissions
intensity scheme through the National Energy Guarantee
(Simshauser & Tiernan, 2019).

The Renewable Energy Target is a renewable certiﬁcate obligation (ROC)
or renewable portfolio standard (RPS) style policy. Energy retailers must buy
a set percentage (currently 20%) of their energy from renewable generators.1
This is achieved by new renewable projects selling certiﬁcates (called large-
scale generation certiﬁcates, or LGCs) for each unit of production to retailers.
This results in new investment in wind, solar and other green technologies.
Policies utilising a ROC-style framework have been well studied in markets in
Europe and Australia (see Foxson & Pearson, 2007; Nelson, 2015; Wood &
Dow, 2010, 2011; Woodman & Mitchell, 2011). Sioshansi (2021, p.3) notes
that, ‘renewable portfolio standards have long been favoured in the United
States – as opposed to Feed-in-tariﬀs or other instruments popular in
Europe’.

Despite the enduring success of the RET as Australia’s only long-term
emissions reduction policy for the electricity sector, the lack of a compre-
hensive national policy approach to reducing emissions has seen state
governments continue to implement suboptimal contract-for-diﬀerence (Cfd)
style policies (Nelson & Gilmore, 2021). A Cfd is eﬀectively an agreement for
the government to make up the diﬀerence between the market price for
electricity and the price agreed to between the renewable generator and the
government. The Victorian Government has utilised Cfd structures to
support new VRE investment through its VRET policy which is aimed at
achieving 50% renewable energy by 2030. This has been legislated in the
Renewable Energy (Jobs and Investment) Act 2017 (Vic). The ACT has
similarly utilised Cfd structures to achieve its goal of 100% of the territory’s
energy being sourced from renewables. Table 1 provides a breakdown of
investment in renewables by scheme driver.

As shown in Table 1, Cfds have comparatively driven only a small
percentage of renewable energy investment with the vast majority of

Australian renewable energy projects banked under the RET (Simshauser &
Gilmore, 2020). However, the NSW Government has now legislated one of
the world’s most ambitious policies through the NSW Energy Roadmap.
Under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020, the NSW Govern-
ment has committed to using ‘swaptions’ or long-term energy service
agreements (LTSEAs) to underpin 12 GW of new renewable generation
across three new Renewable Energy Zones (REZs).2
‘Swaptions’ are
contracts where the seller has an option to take up a Cfd at some point in
the future. The plan also involves the use of an underwriting mechanism to
deliver ~2 GW of new ﬁrming capacity such as battery storage or pumped
hydro. It is therefore a critical policy juncture point to assess whether the
RET in a moderated form or Cfds are a superior policy choice to drive
renewable investment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The NSW Government is responding to market forecasts that over the next
20 years Australia’s ageing baseload coal ﬂeet will be progressively replaced
by 30–45 GW of additional utility scale renewable energy capacity (AEMO
ISP, 2020, p. 12). It is anticipated that this renewable growth will be
facilitated by the parallel development of 15–20 GW of ﬂexible, dispatchable,
fast-start ﬁrming capacity. Given the high expected levels of variable
renewable energy (VRE) penetration, around half of this ﬁrming capacity is
likely to be ‘medium’ and ‘deep’ energy storage (+4hrs). Technologies likely
to be deployed include pumped storage hydro, long-duration battery storage
and potentially hydrogen fuel cells or turbines.

Given the shortcomings of Cfd style policies being adopted by state
it is unclear why
governments are well known (see Simshauser, 2019),
policymakers have pivoted away from ROC/RPS policies towards Cfds.3 The
purpose of this paper is to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the RET in this
context and consider how it could be utilised in the future as part of
Australia’s policy architecture to reduce emissions cost eﬀectively within the

2 In contrast, peak demand in the entire NSW region is only ~14 GW.

certiﬁcated schemes, although this has never been tested by Australian courts.

electricity sector. Section 2 provides a brief literature review of analysis of
Australian and international renewable energy stimulus and greenhouse
abatement policies. Section 3 presents simple quantitative analysis of the
RET across the twin objectives of eﬃcient design and emissions reduction.
RET policy design adjustments, based upon quantitative analysis of marginal
and average abatement, are presented in Section 4 with concluding remarks
following in Section 5.

2. Literature review

The existing literature is heavily skewed towards analysing the use of a broad-
based carbon price to reﬂect the externality cost of producing greenhouse gas
emissions. It is almost universally agreed that a well-designed carbon pricing
mechanism would be a superior policy choice for reducing emissions
(Freebairn, 2020). Studies examining national and international greenhouse
gas emissions pricing include the following: Freebairn (2012, 2014a, 2014b,
2018); Garnaut (2011, 2014, 2015); Holden and Dixon (2018); Quiggin et al.
(2014); Wood and Blowers (2016); Naughten (2013); The Climate Institute
(2013); Kember et al. (2013); and Clarke (2011). Many of these studies are
quantitative in nature and conclusions have been built upon through the use
of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling. These include Adams
(2007), Adams and Parmenter (2013), Adams et al. (2014) and Meng et al.
(2013). In particular, McKibbin, Wilcoxen and their colleagues have
published multiple studies since the 1990s (see, e.g., McKibbin et al., 2009,
2012, 2014; McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 2002a, 2002b; Pearce & McKibbin,
2007).4

However, although the theoretical and applied literature demonstrating a
well-designed emissions trading scheme should be adopted, most of the
political debate is ﬁxed on the future of coal and gas within the real economy
in Australia. Sadly, this completely misrepresents the real risks to the
Australian economy (Nelson, 2015). Australia is one of the world’s largest
energy exporters. Coal (14.8%) and gas (10.6%) comprise around one-
quarter of Australian exports. Australia is the largest exporter of coal with
around 30% of all total coal exports and has recently overtaken Qatar as the
world’s largest exporter of LNG. In this context,
it matters little what
Australian politicians think the future of gas and coal looks like. What
matters are the views of Australia’s largest energy trading importers such as
Japan, Taiwan, China and Korea. All of these countries have committed to
net zero and are shifting consumption away from Australia’s fossil fuel
exports. The sad outworking of this situation is that, ‘According to the 2020

4 Both McKibbin (in general) and Nelson (2015) make the point that mitigation impacts on
Australia are likely to be mostly incurred through other countries shifting their energy mix
away from coal and gas, two large sources of export revenue.

Climate Change Performance Index, Australia was ranked as the worst-
performing country on climate change policy (Ali et al., 2020)’.

2.1 The cost of uncertainty and the ‘merit-order eﬀect’

Given the fraught political debate about the future of coal and gas in the
Australian economy, there has been ongoing policy discontinuity in relation
to energy and climate change (see Simshauser & Tiernan, 2019). The costs of
this ongoing policy uncertainty have been well documented in the Australian
literature (see Byrnes et al., 2013; Jones, 2010, 2014; Nelson, 2015; Nelson
et al., 2010, 2012). Many of these studies note that in a capital-intensive
industry such as electricity, a lack of certainty in relation to public policy
results in suboptimal capital investment (including the potential for stranded
asset risk in higher capacity factor gas plant). Over time, this manifests in
higher than necessary electricity costs driven by a higher weighted average
cost of capital (WACC) and an industry preference to minimise capital at risk
by deploying higher operating cost technologies (see Nelson et al, 2010;
Nelson et al, 2013).

Simshauser and Gilmore (2020) provide a very useful overview of the ‘rate
of change’ problem whereby signiﬁcant additional costs have been imposed
on the Australian economy due to Australia’s policy incoherence. Ongoing
policy changes resulted in an ‘investment megacycle’ whereby ~12,000MW of
plant commitments comprising $20+ billion across 105 projects was squeezed
into just three years (2017–2020).5 Unsurprisingly, there were signiﬁcant
connection delays and major issues with system frequency operating outside
normal bands, critical reductions in system strength and increasing interven-
tions by the market operator to keep the system secure. Instead of focusing
on these important engineering issues, the policy debate shifted towards
market redesign proposals with a focus on future reliability and resource
adequacy. Sadly, very little of the debate was grounded in an understanding
of the problem (see Nelson et al., 2018).

2.2 Renewable energy certiﬁcate schemes

The main limitation of mechanisms such as the RET is that they are not
technology neutral. While they are a better policy design than general
subsidies, they overlook opportunities for abatement (e.g. energy eﬃciency)
because of their focus on new investment in production capacity (Freebairn,
2018). While mechanisms that subsidise new investment can lower wholesale
electricity prices in the short run (assuming the absence of existing generator
retirements) (Bell et al., 2017), the policy can have the perverse eﬀect of
stimulating electricity consumption beyond eﬃcient levels (Freebairn, 2018).
Critically, the ‘merit-order eﬀect’ of lower prices is temporary. Wholesale

prices will rise to the long-run average cost (LRAC) of the eﬃcient new
generation mix (see Nelson et al., 2018)6. Importantly, quantitative modelling
has demonstrated that LRET style mechanisms have higher abatement costs
than well-designed emissions tax and trading mechanisms (Buckman &
Diesendorf, 2010). In short, most of the literature around LRET style policies
ﬁnds that they are inferior to a well-designed emissions trading scheme (see
Nelson et al., 2019).

There are also signiﬁcant beneﬁts associated with ROC-style policies such
as the LRET. In the Australian context, the LRET has resulted in signiﬁcant
additional investment, particularly in new wind generation (Cludius et al.,
2014). Bell et al. (2017) found that the LRET has lowered wholesale spot
prices through reductions in technology costs. Rather than the overarching
policy mechanism, design ﬂaws of LRET in its implementation in a market
with signiﬁcant retail and generator concentration may have contributed to
suboptimal outcomes (see, e.g., Buckman & Diesendorf, 2010; Simshauser &
Tiernan, 2019). Furthermore, the ongoing review and amendment of the
LRET and continuing disagreement between the Commonwealth and state
impact on its cost-
governments is likely to have had a detrimental
eﬀectiveness (see Jones, 2010, 2014).

2.3 Contracts-for-diﬀerence schemes
Government-initiated Cfds are relatively simple in structure.7 Governments
hold reverse auctions for capacity and award Cfds to the winning proponents
of new generation. The Cfd structure generally involves a ‘strike price’, which
is compared to the wholesale spot price in each settlement period. Where the
wholesale price is lower than the strike price, the government pays the
proponent the diﬀerence. If the wholesale price is higher than the strike price,
the generator pays the government the diﬀerence.

While it is true that CfDs may reduce risks to individual project proponents
from a LRET ﬂoating LGC price (Woodman & Mitchell, 2011), Bunn and
Yusupov (2015) demonstrate that with negative correlation between renew-
able output and wholesale electricity prices, LGCs reduce counterparty
investment risk when compared to Cfds or feed-in tariﬀs (FiTs).

There are obvious problems with utilising Cfds. Governments eﬀectively
‘become the market’ and determine which generator investments proceed.
While governments have learned important lessons from previous failures to
deal with marginal loss factor (MLF) risk and prolonged oversupply and
negative pricing, their continued use will eﬀectively result in governments
(rather than markets) absorbing all of the risk of poor investment decisions.

6 A reviewer of this manuscript helpfully noted that this LRAC may in fact be lower than
that of the previous eﬃcient mix due to the introduction of new lower cost of technologies.
7 A reviewer of an early draft of this manuscript helpfully noted that the discussion around

Cfds in this Section is speciﬁc to government-initiated Cfds, not Cfds in general.

T. Nelson et al.

Electricity markets are incredibly dynamic and investments need to consider
not just the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) but the spatial and temporal
dynamics of market pricing. Building very low-cost generators with very high
renewable resources in congested and weak parts of the grid has resulted in
very poor outcomes in Victoria’s north-west (see Simshauser & Gilmore,
2020). Furthermore, it is na¨ıve to assume governments are well placed to
decide which investments are likely to be economic due to the need to assess a
project’s production against a dynamic market with signiﬁcant changes in
demand across the day and season. In fact, one of the strengths of utilising a
market approach rather than a Cfd is that poor investments result in the
project proponent (rather than the government) writing down their invest-
ment with consumers beneﬁting.

Simshauser (2019) notes that there are three inherent limitations associated

with Cfds:

(cid:129) Government-initiated CfDs are usually awarded on simpliﬁed metrics such
as minimising the LCOE. As noted above, ignoring temporal and spatial
dynamics is likely to introduce ineﬃcient plant entry. In contrast, well-
designed renewable portfolio standards such as the LRET require investors
in generation to determine not just costs but the spatial and temporal
dynamics of the project relative to the market.

(cid:129) Importantly, Cfds introduce a new category of ‘quasi-market’ participant
that is completely removed from the market’s locational, spot and forward
pricing signals. Over time, this results in suboptimal decision making within
the dispatch of energy and increases the risks to secure and reliable system
operation.

(cid:129) The use of Cfds results in these new ‘quasi-market’ participants withdraw-
ing from primary issuance forward derivative hedge markets. Given the
certainty of revenue due to the Cfd, there is little incentive for these new
generators to manage price risk using ﬁnancial derivative contracts. Over
time, the government eﬀectively becomes the market. Eﬃcient pricing,
retail competition and innovation are likely to be stiﬂed as new participants
are unable to compete.

One of the overlooked aspects of Cfds in the Australian context is the
impact of shifting policy support to an alternative mechanism despite the
signiﬁcant investment made to date under a long-term enduring policy. The
RET has delivered over 16 GW of new investment, which is underpinned by
the market value of wholesale electricity prices and LGCs. By shifting
towards Cfds, governments are eﬀectively stranding investments and eﬀec-
tively transferring existing renewable proponent producer surplus to con-
sumer surplus and new entrants with the potential for issues related to
reﬁnancing and ‘toxic debt’ (see Nelson et al., 2013; Simshauser & Nelson,
2012). Our analysis and policy recommendations in subsequent sections
consider ways in which Cfds could be modiﬁed to minimise these impacts.

Advocates of Cfds generally use two arguments that are ﬂawed in our
opinion: reductions in the weighted average cost of capital; and the ‘merit-
order eﬀect’. Given the signiﬁcant exposure of existing debt and equity
participants to the 16 GW of projects already built under the RET (with
much of it being reﬁnanced in 2022 and 2023), project proponents will likely
face higher WACCs as a result of the erosion in value of their projects due to
the switch from one form of policy support (RET) to another (Cfds) – see
Simshauser and Gilmore (2020) for further analysis on this topic.

The ‘merit-order eﬀect’ has been promoted as a reason for introducing
both ROC and Cfd style policies. The phenomenon is well documented in the
academic literature, with studies originating from around 2008. The earliest
studies focused on economic impacts of introducing very low short-run
marginal cost technologies such as variable renewables (Gelabert et al., 2011;
Pirnia et al., 2011; P ¨oyry for the European Wind Energy Association, 2009;
Sensfuss et al., 2008). Australian studies have also examined the phe-
nomenon. Many studies have considered the impacts on the NEM price
duration curve (see Bell et al., 2017; Cludius et al., 2014; Forrest & MacGill,
2013; MacGill, 2010) and the impact of coincident production on speciﬁc
price bands.

However, as Nelson et al. (2012) and Simshauser (2019) note, the merit-
order eﬀect is a transitory phenomenon. Prices must return to levels that
allow for ﬁxed and operating costs to be recovered or plant is permanently
withdrawn, resulting in signiﬁcant intra- and interperiod pricing volatility
(see Nelson et al., 2018). This is an important observation given one of the
purported beneﬁts of the NSW Energy Roadmap is permanently lower
wholesale electricity prices.8

2.4 Emerging literature on policy evolution

A deﬁning feature of good public policy is the creation of a uniform value of
abatement. This allows for the lowest cost abatement to be pursued ﬁrst
(Freebairn, 2020). It is therefore worth considering whether the RET can be
‘evolved’ to better align with this principle by creating fungibility with other
forms of abatement in Australia such as Australian Carbon Credit Units
(ACCUs). This is something that was explored by Nelson et al. (2021) who
proposed tying economic value from ROC, Cfd or PFiT policies to either
emissions intensity or wholesale electricity prices.

Our analysis in the proceeding sections considers this issue. In particular,
we ﬁnd that the worst impacts of Cfd can be overcome if they are written
against the LGC (rather than the wholesale price). This ensures that market

8 It is important to note the two distinct pricing outcomes. One is the result of shifting to a
lower cost mix of new technologies. The other is driven by government-induced oversupply
with a transfer of existing producer surplus (including existing clean energy generation) to
consumer surplus.

participants continue to face the spatial and temporal dynamics associated
with locating and operating in the NEM. This can also allow for integration
of Cfd policies within a broader carbon framework due to the assignment of
carbon abatement to LGCs through an emissions ‘exchange rate’.

3. Assessment of the RET against multifaceted criteria

In this section, we evaluate the RET against qualitative and quantitative
criteria: emissions abatement; and price and cost-eﬀectiveness. The purpose
of our analysis is to determine whether the RET has been successful as a
means of providing a sustainable framework for cost-eﬀective emissions
reductions within the electricity sector.

3.1 Emissions abatement

Australia currently produces around 500 million tonnes (mt) of greenhouse
emissions (carbon dioxide equivalent: CO2e) each year. The sectoral
breakdown of emissions is shown in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1 shows that the stationary energy sector (including electricity)
produces around half of all greenhouse emissions. Electricity is the largest
single point source of emissions with around one-third of total Australian
emissions. However, it is also a relatively low-cost source of abatement with
the potential for further technology evolution and deployment into other
transport and stationary energy
sectors

through electriﬁcation (e.g.

processes). Given these dynamics, it is not surprising that the electricity sector
has been the focus of policy makers through the RET and now emerging Cfd
policies in the ACT, Victoria and NSW.

Figure 2 shows the impact of electricity sector policies on generation
output in the NEM over the past decade. As uncertainty around the
investment trajectory required by the RET was removed following the
Warburton Review in 2014 (see Nelson, 2015), an investment megacycle
occurred between 2017 and 2020 (recall Table 1). The share of variable
renewables (VRE) climbed rapidly to around 20% in 2020. Almost all this
investment utilised LGCs as part of project economics and ﬁnancing.

Figure 3 shows the strong correlation between the penetration of VRE and
electricity sector emissions in recent years. As new renewables have entered
the system, existing and ageing coal assets have been retired. In fact, around
one-third of Australia’s coal-ﬁred power stations closed in the 2010s as a
consequence of renewables entering the system (Burke et al., 2018). The
substitution of these relatively high emitting assets with renewables has
reduced NEM emissions by around 15%. Importantly, the contribution of
electricity sectoral emission reductions to the overall Australian inventory has
been signiﬁcant. This is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 demonstrates that the RET is likely to have done much of the
heavy lifting in relation to Australian emissions reductions. Quarterly total
emissions have decreased from ~145mt in 2010 to around ~125mt in 2020. Of
this ~20mt reduction in quarterly emissions,
the electricity sector has

delivered around 60% or ~12mt per quarter. This is a nontrivial ﬁnding. Of
all the policies introduced to reduce emissions (QLD 18% Gas Scheme, NSW
GGAS, Clean Energy Future, Emission Reduction Fund and Safeguard
Mechanism), a single policy is arguably delivering the majority of the
emissions reductions that are being sustainably achieved (as noted in Figure 3
and supported by Nelson et al., 2018 and Simshauser, 2019).9 As a policy
instrument, the RET has been very successful in reducing emissions. It is
continuing to provide the underlying policy architecture for additional
reductions through voluntary purchases by corporate customers and house-
holds (via GreenPower).10

3.2 Pricing and economic eﬀectiveness

Electricity pricing has been a politically charged topic in Australia following
the closure of the Hazelwood power station and a rapid run up in wholesale
electricity prices in 2017 and 2018. Since 2011, the general Consumer Price
Index (CPI) rose by around 2% pa, while the electricity component of the
CPI rose by around 3.5% pa. Much of this is explained by ineﬃcient increases
in network spending and a rise in new entrant costs for wholesale markets.
Simshauser and Gilmore (2020) note that the NEM’s history of new entrant
cost is comprised of three separate and distinct time periods. Up until 2011,
the NEM was characterised by new entrant costs of between $40/MWh and
$60/MWh with the dominant technology shifting from coal to gas in the mid-
2000s. Between 2011and 2015, the NEM new entrant cost increased further to
between $60-80/MWh for a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) as higher gas
prices manifested because of east-coast gas demand tripling due to the
emergence of LNG exports. Since 2015, the new entrant cost has approx-
imated $70–80/MWh as ﬁrmed wind has emerged as the technology of
choice.11,12

It should be noted that the upward trend in new entrant cost is not simply a
function of the RET. Input fuel costs for thermal plant have increased
signiﬁcantly over the past decade as both coal and gas markets became
increasingly export exposed. In the case of coal, $AUD pricing increased

9 While the RET has signiﬁcantly reduced emissions,

it is unclear how much higher
emissions would have been without energy eﬃciency measures that have reduced energy
consumption.

10 As at June 2021, there are around 3 GW of new large-scale renewable projects at various

stages of commissioning and construction.

11 Firmed wind is eﬀectively the cost of a MWh of wind added to the cost of a $300 cap
contract (which reﬂects the ﬁxed cost of a gas-turbine). In this way, the MWh of wind becomes
‘ﬁrmed’ by the gas turbine and is equivalent to an MWh from a high-capacity factor thermal
plant.

12 Some market participants have announced Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) well
below these new entrant costs. This is due to the emergence of ‘two-step pricing’ whereby
participants allocate low returns to equity in the short to medium term with a view that
signiﬁcant returns will emerge in the future due to higher pricing. This business model is
unlikely to be sustainable.

from ~$50/tonne in 2005 to ~$100–150/tonne over the past decade. Assuming
a heat rate of 9 to 10GJ/MWh, the implied short-run marginal fuel cost has
increased from $25/MWh up to as high as $65/MWh. Similarly, gas prices
increased materially from a historical cost-plus model of around $3–4/GJ to
LNG export netback prices of up to $15/GJ. Given this signiﬁcant variability
in fuel cost, it is unsurprising that the benchmark new entrant cost has
become ﬁrmed renewables.

Figure 5 shows that the Australian NEM and RET are classic commodity
markets. There is both intra- and interperiod volatility within the NEM,
representing lumpy capital investment and withdrawal and short-term spatial
and temporal constraints (see Nelson et al., 2018). When annual averages are
considered, prices reﬂect market imbalances and are generally mean reverting
(like any commodity market).

However, policy discontinuity also played a signiﬁcant role in the market
dynamics observed in Figure 5. Between 2013 and 2015, the Commonwealth
Government repealed Australia’s national carbon pricing framework and
commissioned a debilitating review of
the RET. During this period,
renewable investment stalled as market participants faced lower prices due
to oversupply,
lower LGC prices due to concerns the Government was
predisposed to repealing the RET legislation and waited for the outcomes of
the Government’s deliberations. With a revised trajectory settled in 2014/15,
LGC prices rapidly recovered and existing coal-ﬁred power stations contin-
ued to withdraw from the market driving wholesale electricity prices higher.

149

To assess the RET’s eﬀectiveness in sustainably driving new investment
(despite the uncertainty discussed above), we have reconstructed the
economics of a ‘typical’ wind project in South Australia developed in each
year between 2011 and 2020. South Australia has been selected given the
signiﬁcant deployment of renewables over the past decade (largely due to the
region’s superior wind speeds). Capital costs, ﬁxed and operating costs, and
ﬁnancing costs have been sourced from Simshauser and Gilmore (2020). The
levelised cost of energy (LCOE) in each year is determined using the following
formula.

LCOE ¼ Capex (cid:2) CRF þ FOM

ð8760∗CFÞ

þ VOM

(1)

Where capex = overnight capital cost ($/kW). FOM = ﬁxed operating and
maintenance costs ($/kW), CF = capacity factor (%),VOM = variable oper-
ating and maintenance costs ($/KWh), CRF = capital recovery factor (the
earning back of initial investment in capex plus a return represented by
WACC).

The capital recovery factor is determined using the following formula:

CRF ¼

(cid:3)
(cid:1)
WACCð1 þ WACCÞt
(cid:3)
(cid:1)
½ð1 þ WACCÞt(cid:3) (cid:4) 1

(2)

where t is the number of time periods
WACC is the weighted average cost of capital, which is determined using the
following formula:

WACC ¼ rd∗Debt share þ ðre∗ð1 (cid:4) debt shareÞÞ

(3)

where rd and re represent the returns to debt and equity respectively and the
debt share is the proportion of total funding that is debt (as opposed to
equity).
Key input assumptions for deriving the LCOE in each year between 2011 and
2020 are presented in Table 2. The proportion of funding from debt and
equity has been set at 50% in each year.

Having derived an LCOE for each year from 2011 and 2012 for a ‘typical’
wind project in the Australian market, we are then able to determine whether
the LCOE is recovered from electricity and LGC revenue. The total revenue
in each year is the aggregate wind proﬁle dispatch weighted average (DWA)
price for the year added to the average annual LGC price per MWh
generated. The net revenue in each year is therefore:

Two sets of results are presented in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. Table 3
shows the net annual revenue for 1 MWh of ‘typical’ South Australian wind
farms built in each year from 2011 to 2020. Table 4 provides the same
analysis but with only the electricity revenue (and not the LGC revenue)
included in the calculations.

Our results demonstrate the variability in cash ﬂows and proﬁtability for
merchant assets in an energy-only gross pool market. Wind farms built
between 2011 and 2015 experienced losses during these years but signiﬁcant
the tight supply/demand balance that prevailed
proﬁtability because of
between 2016 and 2018. As the market cycle swung back into oversupply in
2019 and 2020, all the projects built across all years (including 2020) once again
experienced negative proﬁtability. In total, 21 of the 55 annual proﬁtability
results provided in Table 3 are negative. This is an important feature of the
RET’s policy design. Consumers beneﬁt from market participants overbuilding
(and facilitating oversupply) through lower prices.13

However, if the LGC revenue is removed (as shown in Table 4), then the
total number of years in which a negative economic outcome is recorded
increases to 46 (out of the total 55 years). This has nontrivial implications for
policy design which we will explore in further detail in the subsequent section.
Put simply, utilisation of policy frameworks that only utilise the wholesale
electricity price are likely to create a signiﬁcant exposure for governments
(and taxpayers) or energy consumers due to prolonged policy-induced
periods of oversupply driving the out-of-market subsidy higher. If this is not

13 It is important to note that LGC’s may have been under long-term contract, and
therefore, market prices may not be as relevant. However, it is important to note that
consumers continued to pay LGC ‘market prices’ as these are referenced in customer contracts.
As such, a key consideration for policy makers in the design of ROC style policies is whether
market power could be used by a small number of liable entities to extract rents from
consumers.

the case, then Cfd style frameworks are likely to accentuate the boom/bust
nature of wholesale electricity prices resulting in poorer outcomes for
consumers.14 At the very least, the RET has not removed the incentive for
participants to manage the temporal and spatial risks associated with
operating in the wholesale electricity market. A renewable resource with a
poor correlation to demand and price is penalised relative to a project that
optimises location and resource to deliver energy where and when customers
require it.

4. Policy recommendations: integrating Cfd frameworks using the RET

The RET required investment in renewable energy generation equivalent to
the annual production of 33 TWh by 2020. At the time of writing, this
objective has been achieved. Discussion about the future of the RET has
largely been muted given the focus by state governments on developing Cfd
policies to deliver climate change objectives. There are two observations from
our analysis of the RET in the preceding Section which are worth noting in
this context:

(cid:129) Finding 1: the RET facilitated both positive and negative years of cashﬂow
(relative to underlying LCOE). In other words, consumers beneﬁted from
overinvestment through lower prices (relative to LCOE) and all project
proponents were required to address the risks associated with the NEM’s
spatial and temporal dynamics.

(cid:129) Finding 2: Without LGC revenue, all projects would have experienced
negative income (relative to LCOE) almost all of the time. This has
nontrivial implications for policy design. Governments could have been
exposed to signiﬁcant ‘out-of-the-money’ Cfd liabilities of ~$0.25 billion in
South Australia alone.15 In other words, all producers would have been
guaranteed to make a return on their investment: privatising proﬁts and
socialising losses.

The policy propositions that

the quantities of
renewables being added to the NEM through to 2030 are ﬁxed and that
renewables continue to be the cheapest form of zero-emissions electricity (see
Rai and Nelson, 2021). For completeness, we have provided quantitative
modelling of Optimal Plant Mixes in 2030 for the NSW system16 in two

follow assume that

14 This is particularly relevant for large energy-intensive trade exposed industry which
cannot be shielded from higher energy costs in the same way that they are under the RET
(through an LGC surrender exemption).

15 This approximate calculation is based upon total MWh produced by wind in South

Australia in 2020 being exposed to the negative economic outcomes in Table 4.

16 Our modelling is based upon the work of Berrie (1967). This model is outlined in detail in
Nelson et al. (2013) so we do not replicate it here. Importantly, the 12 GW scenario utilises a
residual demand curve based upon assumptions from AEMO’s Integrated System Plan. All
costs utilised are consistent with those in Table 2.

scenarios: build out of the 12 GW of VRE; and no build out of VRE. Our
results (presented in Appendices S1 and S2) show that the price of electricity
is substantially lower in the 12 GW built out case. The focus of our policy
propositions are therefore not related to whether it is appropriate to drive
abatement through VRE adoption, but consideration of superior policy
design to limit unintended consequences associated with Cfds identiﬁed in
Section 2.

4.1 Policy proposition 1 – utilising the RET architecture to implement Cfd
polices

State governments are adopting ambitious policies to decarbonise electricity
grids between 2020 and 2030. This article provides insights into how these
governments could modify their policy frameworks to achieve these goals
while limiting the most negative impacts of Cfds. Section 2 demonstrated that
two limitations in particular require particular attention by policy makers: by
underwriting projects through the wholesale price, governments eﬀectively
remove the need for market participants to eﬃciently locate and operate their
projects to maximise value given spatial and temporal dynamics; and
governments eﬀectively underwrite all the new projects in the market.

Both limitations could be overcome by writing the Cfd or swaption on
LGCs created through the RET policy architecture. By entering into a Cfd
(or swaption) for the government to acquire and voluntarily surrender the
LGCs, market participants would still be required to locate and operate
their project eﬃciently within the wholesale electricity market to maximise
value.17 Market participants would be required to carefully consider
location (to avoid issues related to reductions in dynamic marginal loss
factors: MLFs) and forward hedging of output to minimise exposure to
volatile spot pricing. Consumers would beneﬁt from increased liquidity and
transparency in the short-term and lower sustainable prices in the long-term
as more eﬃcient projects are built and market participants (rather than
governments and/or consumers) face the risk of lower returns due to poor
project performance.

The ‘spread’ of potential price outcomes for LGCs is likely to be lower than
wholesale electricity prices. Assuming current forward market pricing (see
Appendix S3), governments could sell put rights to LGCs for a strike of ~$20/
LGC. As such, the maximum exposure in any year for each MWh would be
$20, although it is unlikely that LGCs would be worth nothing (particularly
given the proceeding discussion in this Article about carbon fungibility). This

17 This could include trading oﬀ total volume (and potentially a higher LCOE) for
additional value, allowing developers to value projects that better match load, are uncorrelated
with other renewable projects, or includes storage that shifts production to higher value
periods.

is a signiﬁcantly better outcome than the average out of the market payment
($56/MWh) that would have been made in 2020 if projects built under the
RET were receiving Cfds.

‘Swaptions’ rather than generic Cfds should be pursued by governments as
a means of incentivising the engagement of voluntary buyers of LGCs. This
would minimise the exposure of governments (and consumers if out-of-
market payments are to be recovered through distribution charges) to
growing ﬁnancial
liabilities. Demand for LGCs by businesses within
Australia continues to grow with many companies committing to ‘science-
based targets’ and aligning their operations and strategy to meet emission
reduction targets implied by the Paris agreement. Companies are increasingly
aware of the need to address climate risk within their operations and the
implications for company directors to discharge their duties under corporate
law.18

The Commonwealth Government

is reforming reporting under the
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act to create greater trans-
parency around how companies in Australia are claiming to be ‘renewable’
or ‘carbon neutral’.19 It is very likely that governments and investors will
require companies to voluntarily surrender LGCs equal to their electricity
use to be able to claim that they are using 100% renewable energy. The
Government is instituting these reforms given the signiﬁcant voluntary
action already being undertaken by corporates in Australia. For example,
22 of the largest companies in Australia have formed a ‘Climate Leaders
Coalition’ and many of Australia’s largest emitters and electricity users are
part of the Climate Active programme established by the Commonwealth
Government.20

By utilising swaptions for LGCs, governments can eﬀectively underwrite
new investment while minimising their own ﬁnancial exposure and
maximising incentives for market participants to locate and operate their
projects eﬃciently and ﬁnd customers for the imbued greenhouse emissions
abatement in their operation. No reforms of the existing RET policy
architecture would be required. The Commonwealth and states could
continue to have diﬀering views on the pace of decarbonisation, but the
framework underpinning new investment in the electricity sector would be
nationally consistent.

4.2 Policy proposition 2 – Carbon fungibility and development of ‘green
hydrogen’

Another key consideration of policymakers in relation to the future of the
RET is its alignment or ‘fungibility’ with other carbon reduction instruments
in Australia. While LGCs surrendered for compliance purposes under the
RET are obviously not ‘additional’, all other LGCs are reducing emissions
beyond legislated targets. Substitution of existing emissions
intensive
generation with new renewables will only occur if: voluntary action is taken
to purchase renewable energy beyond what it is required by the market;
governments mandate new additional VRE investment through Cfds or
‘swaptions’; and/or existing thermal generation is retired at its end-of-life and
new renewables investment occurs to ﬁll the gap created by generator exit.

The ﬁrst two scenarios described above are clearly additional. Additional
abatement is occurring because of voluntary market activity over and above
what would occur through business-as-usual. It is therefore worth consid-
ering how governments create ‘fungibility’ between the greenhouse abatement
facilitated as a result of LGC creation and other sectors where the Australian
Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) represents one tonne of abatement.21

To create ‘fungibility’,

it is ﬁrst necessary to deﬁne an exchange rate
between LGCs (which represent 1 MWh of renewable energy production) and
an ACCU (which represent 1 tonne of greenhouse abatement). This is
achieved through converting LGCs into ACCUs through measuring the
tonnes of abatement per MWh of renewable electricity generated and
consumed. Nelson et al (2021) proposed that exchange rates could be based
upon the average emissions intensity (EI) or the marginal emissions intensity
at a point in time (such as each half hour of settlement within the NEM) or
over a year.

To consider the most appropriate exchange rate, we have calculated the
average emissions intensity by half hour period, the average marginal
intensity of emissions by half hour period, the average and marginal
intensities across the entire year, and the wholesale electricity price by half
hour. We utilised 2019 data and calculated these metrics for New South
Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. We have not considered
transmission ﬂows. For example, NSW does not ‘import’ brown coal
emissions from Victoria. Our calculations for marginal emissions are based
on the emissions intensity of the marginal price setter(s) from AEMO’s
NEMDE dispatch engine. In other words, the emissions intensity of the unit

21 An ACCU is a unit issued to a person by the Clean Energy Regulator (Regulator) by
making an entry for the unit in an account kept by the person in the electronic Australian
National Registry of Emissions Units (Registry). One ACCU represents one tonne of
abatement. The predominant buyer of ACCUs is currently the Commonwealth Government
through the Emissions Reduction Fund, although voluntary demand for ACCUs to oﬀset
emissions is growing.

(s) that would have supplied additional MW in that region but could be
located anywhere in the NEM.

The results of our emissions intensity analysis are presented in Figure 6.
The ﬁrst clear trend is that emissions intensity (particularly marginal
emissions intensity) and price are anticorrelated. During periods of low
prices, coal units are typically setting the price. If renewable generators
produce at times of higher market prices, they are oﬀsetting a generator that,
on average, is almost half as emissions intensive (i.e. a blend of gas and
hydro). Given the diurnal nature of electricity markets, marginal emissions
are low during the evening peak and higher overnight.

Another key observation is that marginal emissions are similar in all
regions (as the NEM is often unconstrained, with similar price setters across
all regions), but average emissions vary signiﬁcantly by state (due to the
diﬀerent composition of generation). In particular, the average is lower in
South Australia, which has the highest penetration of large- and small-scale
variable renewable generation. Importantly, average emissions do not change
signiﬁcantly throughout the day22, but follow similar trends.

We recommend that policy makers set LGC/ACCU exchange rate
fundamentals using the average annual emissions intensity of the entire

22 The relatively constant temporal average emissions are due to the dominance of coal and
renewable generation for energy with gas being relied upon for capacity (and a correspondingly
low capacity factor).

NEM. The only way marginal emissions intensities could be used in a
meaningful way would be through dynamic marginal emissions pricing (i.e.
LGC conversion rates that vary every half hour). In practice, this would be
incredibly diﬃcult and administratively burdensome. Alternatively, average
emission intensity provides an accurate outcome when considered across the
entire market (recall Figure 3). As the NEM will increasingly be intercon-
nected through transmission built out under the Integrated System Plan
(ISP),
it is increasingly certain that generation in any state will reduce
emissions across the NEM.

By utilising LGCs when issuing Cfds or ‘swaptions’, creating fungibility
between LGCs and ACCUs and utilising LGCs as a means of guaranteeing
the origin of ‘green hydrogen’ (see Appendix S4), Australian policymakers
would have eﬀectively facilitated a nationally consistent and integrated
energy and climate policy (without purposely seeking to do so). Market
participants would continue to be able to invest with conﬁdence in new
supply and governments would be less exposed to growing out-of-market
obligations to ﬁnance poor projects. International investors would be able to
purchase quality Australian carbon units with signiﬁcant stimulus to the
Australian economy.

5. Concluding remarks

to force this outcome. Firstly,

Freebairn (2020) provides a useful overview of how to consider a package of
greenhouse abatement policies. While he argues a national emissions price is
the most eﬃcient policy tool, it is unlikely to be the only policy required. Two
institutional barriers,
constraints exist
transaction costs and other nonprice barriers will exist that mute pricing
signals. Energy eﬃciency standards for new appliances are a good example of
this ﬁrst barrier. The second constraint relates to the real political economy
and public resistance to emissions trading and ‘carbon taxes’. In the
Australian context, the second constraint is likely to be more pervasive,
although this may change due to the emergence of border adjustment taxes
that are being developed by major trading partners such as the European
Union.

Climate policy will therefore need to evolve in a way that maximises
economic eﬃciency but is able to be enduring given political realities. In the
Australian context, it is worth considering recent community polling, which
indicates that 55 per cent of all voters agree with reducing emissions to ‘net
zero’ by 2050 with 33 per cent undecided. At the same time, the proportion of
voters that believe the target should be met through increased deployment of
renewable energy is 61 per cent.23 As such, there is considerable merit in

exploring how the RET architecture could be utilised to support growth in
investment in renewables beyond the mandated 33 TWh by 2030.24

This article has reviewed the eﬀectiveness of the RET as a policy tool for
driving investment
in renewable energy and reducing emissions and
contrasted it with emerging state-based Cfd style policies. The RET has
been the primary policy tool for reducing emissions within Australia. In
relation to its impact on electricity markets and consumers, we make two key
ﬁndings:

(cid:129) Finding 1: The RET facilitated both positive and negative years of cashﬂow
(relative to underlying LCOE). In other words, consumers beneﬁted from
overinvestment through lower prices (relative to LCOE) and all project
proponents were required to address the risks associated with the NEM’s
spatial and temporal dynamics.

(cid:129) Finding 2: Without LGC revenue, all renewable projects would have
experienced negative income (relative to LCOE) almost all the time. This
has nontrivial implications for policy design. Governments or consumers
could have been exposed to signiﬁcant ‘out of the money’ Cfd liabilities. In
other words, all producers would have been guaranteed to make a return
on their investment: privatising proﬁts and socialising losses.

Given state governments are pivoting towards Cfd auctions to facilitate
new renewable investment, our policy recommendations relate to integrating
the beneﬁts of the RET and LGC framework within these auction processes.
By writing the Cfd or swaption on the LGC, rather than the wholesale
electricity price, policy makers could overcome the worst aspects of Cfds.
Most importantly, new projects would continue to be exposed to dynamic
spatial and temporal pricing signals and project proponents (rather than
governments or consumers) would wear the risk of underperformance of their
investment.

A further beneﬁt of utilising the existing LGC framework is the integration
of electricity sector abatement within a broader trend of corporates
voluntarily reducing emissions.25 This article has analysed half hourly
marginal, average and annualised marginal and average emissions intensities

24 While economists would contend that a technologically neutral policy would be more
eﬃcient, almost all energy economists, market participants and the peak body in Australia

the RET policy architecture) and voluntary purchases of abatement are required to hasten the
substitution of existing coal plants with ﬁrmed renewables in a manner consistent with meeting
Australia’s carbon budget implicitly committed to as part of the Paris agreement.

25 LGC prices have continued to be non-negative despite the RET being fully subscribed
from a compliance perspective. This is due to continued growth in demand from electricity
customers for LGCs to ‘oﬀset’ their electricity consumption. Appendix S3 shows how forward
LGC prices continue to trend above the fundamentals implied through a pure compliance lens.

In 2001, Australia introduced legislation requiring investment in new renewable electricity generating
capacity. The legislation was signiﬁcantly expanded in 2009 to give effect to a 20% Renewable Energy
Target (RET). Importantly, the policy was introduced with bipartisan support and is consistent with
global policy trends. In this article, we examine the history of the policy and establish that the ‘stop/start’
nature of renewable policy development has resulted in investors withholding new capital until greater
certainty is provided. We utilise the methodology from Simshauser and Nelson (2012) to examine
whether capital market efﬁciency losses would occur under certain policy scenarios. The results show
that electricity costs would increase by between $51 million and $119 million if the large-scale RET is
abandoned even after accounting for avoided renewable costs. Our conclusions are clear: we ﬁnd that
policymakers should be guided by a high level public policy principle in relation to large-scale renewable
energy policy: constant review is not reform.

Introduction

Australia has signiﬁcant reserves of low-cost black coal, brown
coal and natural gas. This energy providence has sustained Australian
economic growth for much of the last century. However, as Jarvinen
et al. (2012, p.63) observed, Australian policy derivation is often
‘policy taking’ rather than ‘policy making’ due to the relatively small
size of Australia in terms of population, technology origination and
global inﬂuence. To that end, Australia has been one of 96 countries
that have embraced government policies designed to facilitate
greater investment in renewable energy technologies (BNEF, 2012)
fuel energy
despite the advantage of abundant low-cost fossil
reserves. Globally, concerns about energy security have motivated
policymakers to introduce mechanisms designed to deploy renew-
able energy. Within Australia, it would be reasonable to state that the

public policy objectives being pursued in relation to renewable
energy relate to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and diversifying
Australia's electricity supplies. This is in addition to market failures
associated with sub-optimal, inter-temporal, investment allocation
given the long-lived nature of electricity infrastructure, and a
bipartisan agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over
the long-term.

In 2011, approximately 90% of all electricity generated in
Australia was fuelled by either coal or gas (ESAA, 2012). The
remaining 10% was sourced from renewables with hydro-electric
generation producing around 7% and wind contributing around 3%
(ESAA, 2012). This result is different when compared to ten years
ago.
In 2000, coal and gas collectively powered 92% of all
electricity generation in Australia with hydro-electricity compris-
ing the remaining 8% (ESAA, 2000). Wind was almost non-existent
as a deployed technology within the Australian electricity market.
The critical difference between the years 2000 and 2011 was the
operation of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET).

The MRET was introduced in 2001 by the Commonwealth
Government with a public policy objective of increasing Australia's

T. Nelson et al. / Energy Policy 62 (2013) 386–400

387

renewable electricity generation by an ‘additional 2%’. It became
known as the ‘2% MRET’ policy and was successful in achieving its
public policy objective: the deployment of more renewable energy.
However, there have been several policy development ‘junctures’
where investor conﬁdence has been damaged due to ongoing
reviews and amendment of this policy. Since the passage of the
legislation underpinning the original MRET policy, there have been
two major amendments and ﬁve points of ‘review’ by policy-
makers. While one of these amendments could be thought of as
being unambiguously material – the expansion of the policy from
2% to 20% – the remaining reviews contributed little towards
providing a stable platform for investors to make long-term
decisions regarding renewable energy infrastructure. For a more
comprehensive outline of the history of Australia's renewable
energy policy see Nelson et al. (2011).

In addition to consistent uncertainty in relation to Australian
renewable energy policy, there has been the added uncertainty
created by the intense debate around climate change policy within
Australia. A thorough explanation of the history of Australian
climate change policy is provided by Nelson et al. (2012). Most
recently, on 1 July 2012, the Commonwealth Government intro-
duced a ﬁxed carbon price or carbon tax of $23 per tonne of carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) which will apply to all
industrial
facilities with emissions greater than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e. It is
intended that the ﬁxed price (which increases each year) will
apply for three years with an emissions trading scheme to
commence operation from 2015. This policy mechanism is
designed to deliver on the Government's policy objective –
reducing Australia's 2020 greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative
to 2000 levels. However, while the objective is shared by the
opposition (Liberal/National Coalition), the mechanism by which
to achieve the target is not. The opposition has committed to
repealing the carbon price legislation if elected to form Govern-
ment and will then implement a ‘direct action’
framework.
Accordingly, policy uncertainty exists in relation to the longevity
of carbon pricing in Australia.

The impact of carbon policy uncertainty has been quantiﬁed in
two aspects by Australian economists (a) suboptimal investment
decisions, and (b) suboptimal
investment costs relative to a
counterfactual scenario. Nelson et al. (2010) examined the costs
investment caused by
associated with the sub-optimal capital
carbon policy uncertainty. They found that the costs could be as
high as $2 billion per annum due to unnecessarily high electricity
prices. This research was tested by other economic modeling ﬁrms
and while the thesis was found to be correct, cost estimates varied.
Nelson, Simshauser, Orton and Kelley (2011) provide a summary of
these studies so we do not intend to replicate such analysis here.
On suboptimal investment costs, Simshauser and Nelson (2012)
estimated the capital market efﬁciency losses associated with
carbon policy uncertainty. Their project ﬁnance market survey
established that providers of debt ﬁnance would impose higher
risk premiums as a result of ongoing policy uncertainty in relation
to carbon pricing. The higher risk premiums would result in capital
market efﬁciency losses of up to $4.5 billion over the period
between 2015 and 2020.

It is in this context that this article considers approaches to
renewable energy public policy development in Australia, applying
the same methodology utilised by Simshauser and Nelson (2012)
to assess the capital market efﬁciency losses associated with
uncertainty in relation to the LRET. It is important to note that
this article is not intended to discuss the merits or otherwise of
renewable energy policy. This has been debated at length in the
Australian and international context (for example, see SKM-MMA,
2012). Rather, our analysis takes as given a renewable energy
policy in place for 11 years with legislated targets for the following
18 years.

This article is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the
evolution of large scale renewable energy policy in Australia and
associated global market developments; the supply and demand
for Large Scale Generation Certiﬁcates (LGCs) is presented in
Section 3; the results of a survey of renewable electricity market
participant views in relation to policy and pricing are documented
in Section 4; Section 5 analyses the capital market efﬁciency losses
associated with higher risk premiums being applied to new
developments; partial equilibrium analysis of electricity price
impacts related to ongoing policy uncertainty is presented in
Section 6; our policy recommendations are presented in Section
7 with concluding remarks provided subsequently.

2. The evolution of large-scale renewable energy policy in
Australia

The Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) was intro-
duced in Australia in 2001. The legislation underpinning the policy
was passed in 2000. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000
and Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001 required elec-
tricity retailers to purchase Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs)
to avoid paying a shortfall penalty of $40 per megawatt hour
(MWh) of renewable energy not acquired. Under MRET, new
renewable electricity generators constructed after 1997, and
incumbent renewable generators who generated power above
their historical baseline, were eligible to create RECs with one
REC equivalent to the generation of one MWh of renewable
energy. The legislation required retailers to progressively increase
their purchases of RECs so that by the year 2010, an additional
9500 MWh of new renewable generation would be produced. It
was forecast that the policy would add renewable generation
output equivalent to around two percent of electricity demand by
2010. It could be argued that the policy was effective in achieving
its objectives over its ﬁrst few years of existence as signiﬁcant new
investments in renewable energy capacity were made in biomass,
landﬁll gas and wind farms. Fig. 1 shows the new installed
renewable capacity (wind and non-wind) since 2001. This is in
addition to the roughly 1.5 GW of small scale solar PV installed
between 2001 and 2011.

In 2003, a review of the MRET legislation was initiated by the
Howard Government and conducted by a panel chaired by former
Senator Grant Tambling. The review came to be known as the
‘Tambling Review’ and heard from interested stakeholders about
the operation of the MRET since its inception in 2001. Recommen-
dations from the review included: the MRET measure to continue
to operate; MRET targets to continue to be expressed in GWh and
not as a percentage of overall electricity demand; MRET targets to
increase beyond 2010 and to stabilise at 20,000 GWh in 2020; and
the end date of the measure to be extended beyond 2020 so that
renewable energy projects receive RECs for a full 15 year period
presumably because such a tenor would align more closely to
project ﬁnancings (Australian Greenhouse Ofﬁce, 2004).

The Tambling Review provided its report to the Minister for the
Environment and Heritage in late 2003, which was tabled in
Parliament in early 2004. The Commonwealth Government made
a number of minor changes to the policy as a result of the
Tambling Review but the signiﬁcant recommendations outlined
above were largely ignored (Australian Greenhouse Ofﬁce, 2004).
When considered in the context of global renewable energy policy,
this is not surprising. Renewable energy investment at the time
was relatively small by comparison to investment in thermal
coal-ﬁred and gas-ﬁred power generation. This is shown in
Fig. 2. Global renewable energy investment (LHS) and the ratio
of global thermal to renewable investment (RHS) are plotted for
the years 2004 through 2011. In 2004, when the Commonwealth

Government largely rejected many of the recommendations of the
Tambling Review, investment in new thermal electricity genera-
tion was around 3.5 times greater than investment in new renew-
able electricity capacity.

Fig. 2 shows that between 2004 and 2007 there was a rapid
run-up in global renewable energy investment and a signiﬁcant
decline in the ratio of thermal to renewable investment. This
coincides with a rising number of countries around the globe
introducing renewable energy targets. While the Commonwealth
Government had ruled out increasing the MRET, various state
governments initiated their own policy frameworks designed to
support the uptake of renewable energy. In 2006, the Victorian
Government legislated the Victorian Renewable Energy Target
(VRET) and the New South Wales Government developed (but
did not legislate) the New South Wales Renewable Energy Target
(NRET). Both policies were effectively duplicates of the MRET
policy with higher targets, whereby a liability was placed on
retailers incentivising the development of new renewable energy
through tradable certiﬁcation.

The 2007 Commonwealth election saw both major political
parties put ambitious clean energy policies to the electorate. The
incumbent Howard Government outlined an expansion of the
MRET to achieve 15% ‘clean’ energy production by 2020.
In
addition to expanding the targets under the MRET, the eligibility
criteria was to be amended to allow ‘effectively zero emission’
technologies such as coal and gas generation with carbon capture
and storage. The Rudd Opposition proposed an expansion of the
MRET targets to achieve 20% renewable energy production by
2020. Regardless, both the incumbent Government and the Oppo-
sition pledged to introduce emissions trading and expand renew-
able energy policies. However, a key point that was noted by all
market participants was the broad-based bipartisan agreement
related to anthropogenic climate change and renewable energy
policies.

Policy certainty did not occur immediately. The Rudd Govern-
ment took almost two years to legislate a relatively simple set of
amendments required to give effect to the expanded 20% Renew-
able Energy Target, lifting the ﬁxed energy target signiﬁcantly

from 9500 GWh to 41,000 GWh.1 However, the legislation passed
in August 2009 also contained a number of material changes to the
design of the original MRET legislation. The most notable of these
was the Solar Credits Multiplier. While small-scale solar PV
generation (residential solar) had historically been able to create
RECs for ﬁfteen years of generation upfront (known as ‘deeming’),
the Solar Credits Multiplier allowed installers of small scale solar
PV to create ﬁve times the number of these certiﬁcates. In effect,
residential solar PV was receiving 75 years worth of certiﬁcates
immediately while all other generation types (e.g.
large-scale
biomass, solar, landﬁll gas and wind) only created RECs as the
actual energy was generated.

At the same time, premium feed-in tariffs for small-scale solar
PV units were being introduced by most Australian state govern-
ments. Table 1 outlines the premium feed-in tariff policies that
were in place in 2010 in each jurisdiction. With the introduction of
the Solar Credits Multiplier and the various premium feed-in tariff
policies, the payback for installing small-scale solar PV was
between 2 and 9 years. With such attractive investment returns,
installation of small-scale solar PV systems signiﬁcantly increased.
The result of these distortions was an effective ‘crowding out’ of
other renewable energy technology options within the RET and an
associated slump in prices due to the material oversupply of RECs.
Fig. 3 shows the annual creation of RECs by generation type
since 2005 (LHS). Note in 2010 that the actual target under the
MRET policy had a demand of 9.5 million certiﬁcates but about 40
million were actually created/supplied, primarily through the
distortionary effects of the Solar Credits Multiplier, or ‘phantom
RECs’ as they became known. The combination of the Solar Credits
Multiplier and state-based premium feed-in tariff policies resulted
in approximately 500 MW of new installed residential solar PV
capacity over the same period (RHS). The RET policy framework
was not incentivising new renewable energy development other
than residential solar PV, but the annual production of renewable
energy was only 1/75 of the certiﬁcates created because, as noted
earlier, the 15-year output from such units is deemed up-front,
and was then multiplied ﬁve times over. Unsurprisingly, REC prices
plunged from around $50 in April 2009 to just $28 per REC in late-
2009 as Fig. 4 later reveals. With wholesale electricity prices in the
various National Electricity Market
regions in 2009
between $33/MWh and $55/MWh, combined revenue from whole-
sale and REC pricing was well short of the roughly $120/MWh
required to bank a new wind farm project at that time.

(NEM)

In late-2009 and early-2010, there were a number of vocal critics of
the newly designed RET. The signiﬁcant disquiet from large-scale
renewable energy producers about the unintended consequences of
the Solar Credits Multiplier and complementary premium feed-in
tariff policies resulted in the Government (with Opposition support)
announcing fundamental changes to the operation of the policy.

1 Following passage of the amendments giving effect to the expansion of the

MRET, the policy became known as the Renewable Energy Target (RET).

In February 2010, the Commonwealth Government announced that
the RET would be split into two new policies: the Large-Scale
Renewable Energy Target (LRET) and the Small-Scale Renewable
Energy Scheme (SRES). The LRET would operate in the same way that
the RET and its predecessor MRET had operated – ﬁxed GWh targets
applied to liable entities with Large-Scale Generation Certiﬁcates
(LGCs) replacing RECs as the certiﬁcate eligible to be traded. However,
only large-scale generation would be eligible to create LGCs for the
41,000 GWh target in 2020. The SRES would allow installers of small-
scale renewable generation (i.e. solar PV units) to create ﬁxed price
$40/MWh certiﬁcates for their deemed abatement with liable entities
(electricity retailers) required to purchase them at rates prescribed by
the independent regulator.

These changes were legislated in June 2010. One of the amend-
ments negotiated during the legislative review process related to
ongoing ‘statutory review’ of the policy. Section 162 of the Renew-
able Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (the legislation underpinning the
LRET and SRES) requires an independent statutory review to be
conducted every two years and presented to Parliament. The ﬁrst of
these reviews was conducted by the newly established Climate
Change Authority and completed on 19 December 2012. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, and indeed ironically, 12 months prior to this
current review, the market essentially closed down for business
due to low certiﬁcate prices and heightened uncertainty that
prevailed due to the review itself. The consequences for market
pricing of renewable energy are highlighted in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 shows the prices of LGCs (formerly RECs) from 2003 to
2012 (LHS). Also shown is the average revenue that would have
been earned by a large scale renewable energy generator from
LGCs and the average wholesale energy price in South Australia in
that year. It should be noted that the long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) of the most economic renewable technology (wind) is
currently about $90–$100 per MWh. Two things are clear from this
graph. First, the market for LGCs responds signiﬁcantly to move-
ments in government policy. Three examples are highlighted:
(a) the rapid run up in LGC prices in 2007 as a result of an election
in which political parties were effectively seeking to ‘out-bid’ each
other in relation to support for renewable energy policy; (b) the
signiﬁcant fall in prices in 2009 as the combination of the Solar
Credits Multiplier and premium feed-in tariffs resulted in signiﬁ-
cant oversupply of certiﬁcates; and (c) the fall in prices in 2010
associated with emerging knowledge of the extent of the over-
supply of RECs that would be carried into the LGC market. And
second, relative policy certainty is required for the combined LGC
and wholesale market revenue to equal or exceed the LRMC of
developing renewable energy in Australia.

The review of policy history in this section highlights the
particularly volatile nature of large-scale renewable energy policy
development since 2001 within Australia. Speciﬁcally, the original
MRET legislation has been materially amended twice in ten years
and reviewed publicly by policymakers on at least four occasions.
The logical question that follows is whether investor and market
participant perceptions of the market have been skewed towards
expecting further legislative or regulatory change.

3. Supply and demand for large scale generation certiﬁcates

Economic theory dictates that the price of an LGC today should
reﬂect the difference between the wholesale electricity price and
the long-run marginal cost of the most economic renewable
energy project at the point of time where new renewable genera-
tion is required due to LGC supply falling short of demand
(discounted to current prices). Accordingly, we have constructed
a simple model of LGC supply and demand to test whether the
price today reﬂects the underlying fundamentals of the market.

The demand and supply for LGCs in our model in any year (y) is
calculated using Eq. (3.1) (demand) and Eq. (3.2) (supply)

DLGC ¼ DRET þ DGP þ DV

ð3:1Þ

where DRET is equal to legislated targets under the Renewable
Energy (Electricity) Act in year (y); DP is equal to yearly demand for
Green Power (projected forward unchanged)2; and DV is equal to
yearly demand for other renewable energy (e.g. known large
contracts).3

SLGC ¼ SCS þ SW þ SH þ SO þ SNW

ð3:2Þ

where SCS is equal to the cumulative surplus of LGCs carried
forward from y (cid:3) 14 ; SW is equal to the annual supply produced by
existing wind turbines; SH is equal to the annual supply produced
by existing hydro generators; SO is equal to the annual supply
produced by other existing renewable generators; and SNW is equal
to the annual supply produced by wind turbines under construc-
tion today.

Balancing Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) in each year (y) produces either a
surplus of LGCs carried forward to y+1 as cumulative surplus or a
deﬁcit carried forward as new supply required. At the beginning of
the modeling period (2012), we have assumed a cumulative
surplus of 32 million LGCs. This is based upon the surplus of
certiﬁcates available at the end of the 2011 compliance period.

Fig. 5. Modeled supply and demand of LGCs from 2012 to 2020.

Fig. 5 shows the results of our modeling of the supply and
demand of LGCs from 2012 to 2020. The signiﬁcant existing
surplus of LGCs in 2012 is gradually absorbed by increasing
demand despite a small amount of new supply through commis-
sioning of projects currently under construction. However, new
supply (from new projects not yet under construction) is not
required until 2015. Beyond 2015, the signiﬁcant increase in
legislated targets under LRET results in rapidly increasing new
build requirements. By 2020, an additional 32 million certiﬁcates
are required to be produced each year to ensure compliance with
the scheme. This is the equivalent of approximately 9000 MW of
new renewable energy capacity (assuming 35–40% capacity factors
and median output from existing ﬂeet of renewable plant). Over
the 6 years between 2015 and 2020 (inclusive), implied annual
new investment is therefore around 1500 MW or $3.3 billion
assuming an ‘all-in’ overnight capital cost of $2200/kW for new
wind (ANZ, 2011).

Our modeling has shown that new renewable generation is
required in 2015. Based upon this observation, we are now able to
calculate the implied LGC price today. As outlined earlier, the price
of an LGC certiﬁcate today should reﬂect the difference between
the wholesale electricity price and the LRMC of the most economic
renewable energy project in 2015 (discounted). Based upon a wind
LRMC of $99/MWh5 (inﬂated by 2.5% to account for inﬂation and
expressed in 2015 dollars)6 and a 2015 forward electricity contract
price (PE) of $55/MWh,7 we can use Eq. (3.3) to solve the efﬁcient
LGC price.
LRMC ¼ PLGC þ PE
$107/MWh¼PLGC+$55/MWh, PLGC¼$52 per certiﬁcate (2015 dollars).
Discounting this price using a discount rate for the ‘cost of
carry’ for the three years between 2015 and 2012 is inherently
difﬁcult given the number of diverse participants in the market

ð3:3Þ

5 We have based our estimate of the LRMC of wind utilising project ﬁnancing
results from a subsequent section within this article. The estimate would be at the
low conservative end of a spread of low, medium and high estimates.

6 It is reasonable to utilise current capital costs for wind given that a two year
construction timeframe would require ﬁnancial close for new projects to be
completed in 2013 (less than a year from the time of writing) to ensure that the
shortfall of LGCs in 2015 is met. Wind is currently the most economic large-scale
renewable energy opportunity in Australia.

with varying costs of ﬁnance.8 Accordingly, we have used a 7–10%
discount rate range to determine that the efﬁcient price of LGC
certiﬁcates in 2012 is in the range of $39 to $42. This can be
contrasted with the price of LGC certiﬁcates being $36 at the time
of this calculation. Based upon this analysis, it would appear that
LGC market participants either: disagree with the fundamentals
presented in this paper; or they believe the market structure is
likely to be changed through further legislative or regulatory
change, thereby diminishing LGC value. In our view prices are
well below those implied by market fundamentals. The efﬁcient
price (based upon market fundamentals and assuming perfect
information) is 8–17% higher than the actual market price depend-
it is
ing upon the discount rate used. Given this disparity,
necessary to consider why market participants are not acting on
this clear arbitrage opportunity and increasing demand for LGCs to
reﬂect the economic disparity between actual and our estimate of
efﬁcient pricing. Our hypothesis is that the continuing review and
change to the large-scale renewable energy policy outlined in
Section 2 has led to a belief among market participants that, in
aggregate, ongoing policy changes will occur and thus any appar-
ent arbitrage opportunity may well be nothing more than ‘a
mirage’. Accordingly, prices have and will continue to trade at a
discount to the ‘efﬁcient’ price because investors must, based on
historical experience, wait to see the government response to the
legislative review by the Climate Change Authority before they
commit scarce debt and equity capital to meet the underlying
policy objective function.

4. Market participant views on the LGC market

To suggest that a genuine price arbitrage exists, is well known
but is not being cleared by a market of buyers and sellers requires
more than a casual observation to be credible. To that end, we
conducted a survey of LGC market participants in mid-2012 to

8 The carryover of Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs) into the Large-Scale
Renewable Target when it was established in 2010 has resulted in a diverse group
of investors holding LGCs. Banks, merchant generators, retailers, vertically inte-
grated utilities and individual investors are all holders of LGCs. Accordingly, we
have used a discount rate range (7–10%) to reﬂect the full range of ﬁnance costs
that these participants may face.

conﬁrm whether the existence of an arbitrage exists, and if so, to
test whether ‘policy uncertainty’ is the key issue preventing the
arbitrage from being cleared by the market efﬁciently. Two sets of
market participants were invited to participate in the survey: (1)
large-scale renewable energy developers and the buyers of the
certiﬁcates (i.e. energy retailers); and (2) project ﬁnancing profes-
sionals. The survey responses for the ﬁrst group of respondents
were facilitated by the Energy Retailers Association of Australia
(ERAA) and the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to remove any bias
associated with knowledge of the authors. 11 ﬁrms responded and
given the relatively small number of materially substantive parti-
cipants in the sector, we believe this sample size is in fact quite
robust because we understand that the most signiﬁcant partici-
pants (by market share) have been included in the sample. That
said, we acknowledge that such a small size requires further
validation of results which we provide in the following analysis.
The second group of respondents was contacted directly. The
survey size for project ﬁnancing professionals was 14 banks and
10 responses were received representing a response rate of 71%.
The results of the survey of large-scale renewable energy devel-
opers and electricity retailers are presented in Table 2.

The results contained in Table 2 conﬁrm that ongoing policy
uncertainty is impeding the efﬁcient clearing and indeed, func-
tioning of the LGC market. The mean of responses indicates that
market participants expect that new generation will be required to
be operational by 2015 to ensure that demand is met. These views
of market participants align with our modeling presented in
Section 3, which is important given our earlier comments on the
existence of market arbitrage. The mean of responses provided in
relation to the ‘efﬁcient’ market price was the price band $45–$50
per certiﬁcate, signiﬁcantly above the current market price of $36
per certiﬁcate. Again, this aligns closely with our modeling in

Section 3 which produced an ‘efﬁcient’ market price of $39 to $42
per certiﬁcate (depending upon the discount rate applied). It is
likely that our lower estimate of the ‘efﬁcient’ market price
relative to the views of those surveyed is a function of our estimate
of the LRMC of wind being at the conservative (low) end of the full
spectrum of estimates of wind LRMC within the industry (perhaps
due to locational or intermittency discounts).

While we would not suggest such results could be relied upon
as conclusive, they are, in our opinion, persuasive in relation to our
hypothesis being robust.
Importantly, the majority of market
participants were of the view that the disparity of pricing between
implied efﬁcient prices based on market fundamentals and actual
prices is the result of ongoing policy uncertainty – speciﬁcally
carbon pricing and the LRET. When asked whether the LRET
should be amended through the legislative review process under-
taken by the Climate Change Authority, 10 out of the 11 partici-
pants surveyed stated that it should not be amended. Importantly,
the results of our analysis of this relatively small sample (by
number of participants) are supported by others including ROAM
Consulting (2012) and environmental market brokers such as
Nextgen (2012) who noted that, “given the history of regulatory
change that has occurred over the last ﬁve years in particular, having
conﬁdence in the long term appearance of the LRET is no easy thing.”
Importantly, our results are not speciﬁc to LRET market partici-
pants. Project ﬁnancing professionals provided similar responses
as Table 3 demonstrates.

Table 3 shows that electricity generation project ﬁnancing
professionals have similar views on the LGC market to LGC market
participants – bearing in mind that project ﬁnanciers have
an especially acute understanding of market conditions given
facilities are illiquid and particularly long-dated.

environmental markets to assess the business case for providing
funding to any new or existing piece of energy infrastructure.
Project ﬁnancing professionals expect that new generation will be
required from 2015 and that the price of LGCs should be between
$45 and $50 per certiﬁcate at the time of writing (albeit with a
signiﬁcantly greater variance of pricing expectations than LGC
market participants). Based upon the mean, these results mirror
those of the market participants. In relation to the reasoning
behind the misalignment between market fundamentals and
pricing, the majority of respondents stated that uncertainty about
the legislative review of LRET and the longevity of carbon pricing
policy are key factors. It is unsurprising given the similarity of
views on these issues that the majority of project ﬁnanciers do not
support further changes to LRET through the Climate Change
Authority legislative review.

5. Capital market efﬁciency losses and policy uncertainty

Policy uncertainty is evidently present within the large-scale
renewable energy industry. There is a rich and detailed existing
economic literature related to the costs of policy uncertainty in
Australia's electricity markets (see for example Nelson et al, 2010;
Frontier Economics, 2010; Sinclair Knight Merz, 2011a; Deloitte,
2011; Nelson et al, 2012a; and Simshauser and Nelson, 2012). Two
basic implications of ongoing public policy uncertainty on the
electricity industry have been explored. Firstly, the impact of sub-
optimal investment in new generation capacity has been exam-
ined. As electricity generation is highly capital intensive, it is
necessary to take a long-term view of market fundamentals and
regulatory and legislative stability to ensure that capital is not
stranded. Secondly, the impacts of capital market efﬁciency losses
have been examined.

It is the second form of uncertainty related to capital market
efﬁciency losses that we address in this article. Given the results
presented in Section 4 indicate that the market is concerned that
further changes to the LRET policy may be made as a result of a
government response to the Climate Change Authority's legislative
review, it is appropriate to ask whether actual material amend-
ment of the policy in 2013 would result in additional risk
premiums being applied to large-scale renewable energy invest-
ments. The framework applied by Simshauser and Nelson (2012) is
useful for answering such a question. We have adopted this
framework in the current section to determine whether further
amendment of the LRET will result in capital market efﬁciency
losses.

Simshauser and Nelson (2012) surveyed project ﬁnancing
professionals to determine pricing, tenors and participation in
the market for funding large scale generation in the NEM.
Simshauser
the NEM has more than
20,000 MW of privately owned (i.e. pre-existing and new entrant)
generating plant and around 17,000 MW (85%) of this is project
ﬁnanced. With such a heavy reliance upon project ﬁnancing,
spreads on syndicated project debt provide a speciﬁc and relevant
insight
the risks
associated with investment in electricity generation infrastructure.
This is important for two reasons. First, historically much of the
plant introduced since the creation of the NEM in the late 1990s
has been project ﬁnanced. Second, and looking forward, while it
may well be true that the large retailer/developers (i.e. AGL
Energy, Origin Energy, TRUenergy) may be theoretically able to
raise on-balance sheet ﬁnance from debt capital markets to avoid
the use of project ﬁnance, such an outcome may lead to a
substantial concentration of renewable plant ownership. In a well
functioning market for new plant, a material proportion of the
large investment required under LRET should be project ﬁnanced

and undertaken by Independent Power Producers if for no other
reason than the predictable balance sheet and investment con-
centration constraints of those large retailer/developers – hence
our interest in broader bank debt spreads.

The results of the Simshauser and Nelson (2012) survey are
presented in Table 4. Note the signiﬁcant increase in Project
Finance (PF) spreads for electricity generation from 2008 to 2011
relative to those of BBB bonds (down only 11% compared to 33%).9
BBB bonds were used as a comparator. While corporate bonds are
not necessarily good substitutes for PF, the relative change in
pricing of both debt instruments is of course entirely relevant.
They found that the most logical explanation of the elevated
spreads relative to local and global comparators was the ongoing
policy uncertainty on greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion of
the study was that the higher spreads arising from carbon pricing
uncertainty would result
in increased electricity prices for
consumers.

The 2012 study noted that volumes in syndicated debt markets
retreated signiﬁcantly during the ‘great recession’ of 2008 and
2009. While markets have rebounded, the most recent observa-
tions point to further potential retreats due to ongoing concerns
about economic conditions in Europe and the fragility of some
banking industries. Fig. 6 shows total syndicated debt transactions
broken down by quarter and year since 2004. While 2011 saw a
signiﬁcant
the ‘great recession’, quarter on
quarter trends for 2012 reveal a subsequent retreat in syndicated
debt.

turnaround post

This has non-trivial implications for Australian energy markets
given around half of Australian investment funding (debt and
equity) is sourced internationally as Simshauser and Catt (2012)
noted. Simshauser and Catt (2012) estimate that between 2010
and 2015, $85.9 billion in capital will be required within the
electricity supply system. Capital
investment on new network
infrastructure and upgrades to existing equipment was forecast
to hit $43 billion. Fully $33.6 billion was projected for reﬁnancing
of existing network infrastructure while $9.4 billion was forecast
to be used to reﬁnance existing power stations.
In addition,
incremental capital between 2012 and 2020 related to the LRET
is likely to be between $20 billion and $30 billion.

This vast capital inﬂow requirement within Australia needs to
be assessed within a domestic capital market which is increasingly
skewed towards energy and resources. Fig. 7 shows private capital
investment in mining, manufacturing and other industries since
2000. Fig. 7 illustrates that capital expenditure on mining has risen
by around 100% since 2009. It is therefore critical that considera-
tion be given to the importance of capital inﬂows for ﬁnancing
resource and energy projects – a thematic identiﬁed in Simshauser

sent the speciﬁc cost of ﬁnancing electricity generation infrastructure.

(2010b). As a consequence of credit concentration limits, domestic
banks are simply incapable of funding all new capital expenditure
in the sector. Given the vast capital ﬁnancing requirements of the
electricity sector between now and 2020 and potential constraints
in global syndicated debt activity as a result of global economic
conditions (and indeed Basel III reforms), it is paramount that
energy policymakers consider the impacts of policy uncertainty on
the attractiveness of Australia (and the Australian energy sector in
particular) as a destination. Intense competition for capital both
domestically (between sectors) and internationally (between
countries) underscores the importance of maintaining policy
stability for investors in electricity infrastructure with long-lived
asset lives.

To test whether policy uncertainty in relation to large-scale
renewable energy would result in distortions related to pricing of
infrastructure by these capital markets, we conducted a survey
of project ﬁnancing professionals as noted in Section 4. The results
of this survey are presented in Table 5.

The results of the survey presented in Table 5 are consistent
with the thematic identiﬁed in Simshauser and Nelson (2012).
Respondents indicated that policy uncertainty (measured by
material amendment to the LRET) would result in ﬁnancing
‘premium penalties’ being applied to both new renewable and
new gas-ﬁred generation projects, which is to be expected. The
mean response was the band 51–100 bps providing an effective
mean of 75 bps above the reasonable credit margin over BBSW in
2012 of 275 bps.

We have applied these survey results to the PF Model utilised
in Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and documented in Nelson and
Simshauser (2013) to examine how changes in ﬁnancing para-
meters impact on the underlying cost structures of baseload/
intermediate combined cycle gas turbine plant (CCGT), renewable
projects (wind) and peaking open cycle gas turbines (OCGT). We
have used the same range of assumptions published in Table 7 of
Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and so we do not intend to
reproduce them here. One key variation is a lower capital turbine

cost for wind at $2200/kW, compared to $2500/kW in the 2012
study.10 Three scenarios have been modeled

1. Certainty scenario: In this scenario, we assume that the Climate
Change Authority recommendation of no substantive changes
to the operation of the LRET is supported by government, and
critically, bi-partisan support for the policy in its current form
continues.11 Spreads on project ﬁnanced power generation
facilities reﬂect uncertainty in relation to carbon pricing but
not uncertainty in relation to renewable policy. This results in
credit margins of 275 bps over BBSW and enables ﬁrms to
secure longer facility tenors. Gas input pricing for CCGT is
assumed to be steady at $4.50/GJ.

2. Uncertainty scenario: Key assumptions in this scenario relate to
government implementing “material changes” to the operation
of the LRET. Bi-partisan support for the policy in its current
form evaporates, resulting in genuine policy uncertainty for
investors. Spreads on project facilities reﬂect both uncertainty
in relation to carbon pricing, and uncertainty in relation to
large-scale renewables. Credit margins
development of
increase by 75 bps to 350 bps over BBSW, and facility tenors
are reduced, which heightens reﬁnancing risks and reduces
achievable debt levels within the capital structure of projects.
Gas input pricing for CCGT remains unchanged and steady at
$4.50/GJ.

3. High gas scenario: Primary assumptions in this scenario are that
as in the certainty scenario, the Climate Change Authority
recommendations of no material changes to the operation of
the LRET are adopted and bi-partisan support for the policy in
its current form continues. Spreads on project-ﬁnanced power
generation facilities reﬂect uncertainty in relation to carbon
pricing but not uncertainty in relation to renewable policy. This
results in credit margins of 275 bps over BBSW. However, gas
input pricing for CCGT signiﬁcantly increases from $4.50/GJ to
$10.00/GJ reﬂecting high global demand for natural gas and the
linkage of previously isolated Australian east-coast domestic
gas markets with LNG pricing (see Simshauser et al., 2011 for
further information on structural gas pricing shocks in Austra-
lia). Carbon pricing of $15/tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is
also included in fuel costs. This scenario has been included to
reﬂect consideration of issues related to gas pricing raised by
Riesz and Tourneboeuf (2012), which as our partial equilibrium
analysis subsequently reveals, is critically important for policy-
makers to consider.

10 Most recent observations for wind capital costs indicate prices are even
lower (see Trustpower (2012) which indicates pricing at $1630/kW). However, we
are uncertain as to whether such pricing includes the full cost of construction, and
speciﬁcally, items such as interest during construction, owners project develop-
ment costs, grid connection and so on. Accordingly, we have opted to use estimates
based on information provided in BREE (2012).

11 For further information on the Climate Change Authority's recommenda-
tions to leave the policy largely unchanged, see Climate Change Authority (2012).

The PF Model results for these three scenarios are presented in
Fig. 8. Gearing is applied relatively consistently at between 60%
and 63%. This represents the main variation in application from
Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and explains the higher returns to
equity and lower interest payments in each of the results for the
200 MW wind project. Financing is provided using 5, 7, 10 and 12
year tenors depending upon the scenario and technology.

Fig. 8 shows that, unsurprisingly, the unit cost of a 200 MW
wind project increases by $4.20/MWh (4.3%) from $98.57/MWh to
$102.77/MWh with the introduction of policy uncertainty. Impor-
tantly, the unit cost of a 1 (cid:4) 400 MW CCGT project also increases
by $0.73/MWh (1.1%) from $64.32/MWh to $65.05/MWh under the
same conditions. The most material change in unit cost occurs
with the signiﬁcant increase in gas pricing where CCGT costs
increase to $103.22/MWh (i.e. above the cost of wind).

Due to the different operating duties of an OCGT (peaking)
plant, the ﬁnancing results are very different to those of a CCGT, as
shown in Fig. 9, which presents the ‘carrying cost’ or ‘total ﬁxed
costs’ (including a normal return on funds invested) for a 525 MW
plant comprising three units. This can be thought of as the fair
value of a $300/MWh call option written by new entrant peaking
plant. The incremental cost of an OCGT in moving from certainty
to uncertainty (scenario 1 to scenario 2) is $0.44/MWh.

6. Partial equilibrium analysis – policy uncertainty and
electricity prices

To assess the economic impact of our different scenarios on
electricity prices, we assume ﬁnancing costs calculated in previous
sections begin to bind immediately from the date at which
legislative change in response to the Climate Change Authority
review is proposed (i.e. 2013). For simplicity, we have assumed
that any legislative change would be announced in late 2013 and
implemented in 2014. Higher LRMC costs associated with policy
change would be revealed in the market from 2017 onwards as
new plant is commissioned (and in practice, as existing plant is
reﬁnanced). CCGT forms the dominant base and intermediate load
technology while OCGT undertakes peaking duties.

We utilise the Optimal Plant Mix Model (OPM Model) from
Simshauser and Wild (2009) to undertake the analysis. This partial
equilibrium electricity system model simulates half-hour resolu-
tion and assumes perfect competition and essentially free entry to
install any combination of capacity that satisﬁes differentiable
conditions. As this model has been documented in Simshauser and
Wild (2009), we do not intend to reproduce the details here.
A static graphical representation of the half-hourly modelling
results is presented in Fig. 10.

Demand has been projected utilising the latest forecasts from
the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO, 2012). These
forecasts account for the recent declines in energy demand
associated with adoption of embedded solar PV, energy efﬁciency
schemes and responsiveness to higher retail prices driven by
increased network costs. Average growth in annual energy for

the ten year period out to 2022 is now forecast to be 1.7%, down
from the previous forecast of 2.3% in 2011. We utilise the
methodology outlined in Nelson et al. (2010) to distribute the
average annual growth of 1.7% across deciles of actual 2011 NEM
demand ranked by time.

The three scenarios outlined in the previous section have each
been modeled using the partial equilibrium framework discussed
above. One additional scenario has also been modeled based upon
material adjustment of the LRET targets to reﬂect recent commen-
tary related to electricity demand being softer than anticipated
when the LRET was ﬁrst legislated. Origin Energy (2012) made the
salient point that with softening electricity demand, the RET
would result in more than 20% of Australia's electricity being
sourced from renewable sources, at least given most recent
forecast information.

The power generation system cost results for each scenario are
presented in Table 6. The certainty scenario results in a system

average cost of $69.17/MWh between 2017 and 2021. The intro-
duction of policy uncertainty results in average system costs
increasing by $0.69/MWh (1.00%) to $69.86/MWh. If the high gas
scenario were to materialise, average system costs would increase
by $33.88/MWh (49%) to $103.05/MWh. Additional costs of oper-
ating higher LRMC renewable plant are revealed in LGC costs
which our subsequent analysis examines.

Table 6 notes that uncertainty results in higher costs associated
with servicing projected future demand. However, this ignores any
potential savings associated with reductions in LGC costs incurred
by retailers, then passed through to customers as reductions in
prices. These cost savings are signiﬁcant. We have utilised an
LRMC methodology represented graphically in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11 shows the revenues that a wind turbine would earn, on
average. Note that these revenues come from two sources: (1) from
the wholesale energy market and (2) from the sale of LGCs. These
two income streams can be thought of as the components that

comprise an appropriately priced Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA). We have assumed away any penalty applied to wind in
wholesale energy markets related to the intermittency of output.
We consider this to be a reasonable assumption given the
relatively modest penalties identiﬁed by Simshauser (2011) in
relation to intermittent wind generation, and the fact that most
other plants will face equivalent intermittency issues in any event.
To calculate the net costs to society of uncertainty created by
material amendment to the LRET, we have contrasted reduced LGC
costs to 2021 with higher wholesale energy costs associated with
the results of our partial equilibrium analysis. Effectively, we have
created two scenarios

(cid:1) Uncertainty: In the uncertainty scenario, we have assumed that
LRET targets beyond 2016 are not increased at all. Effectively,
this scenario simulates a situation where the LRET policy is
repealed. However, it presumes that existing investments are
grandfathered (including projects committed through to 2014).
Higher wholesale energy costs (outlined in Table 6 previously)

are incurred due to investor perceptions of regulatory risk as a
result of the material amendment of the policy. However, these
higher costs are somewhat offset by the reduced LGC liability
between 2017 and 2021 as a result of repeal of the LRET
legislation.12

(cid:1) Uncertainty (low demand): For the uncertainty (low demand)
scenario, we have assumed that LRET targets are reduced in
2014 to reﬂect softening projections of electricity demand in
2020 and a desire to achieve no more than 20% renewable
electricity by 2020 given lower demand forecasts. Using the
logic in Origin (2012), we have reduced the targets between
2016 and 2020 to ensure a linear approach to 27 TWh in 2020,
down from 41 TWh. Higher wholesale energy costs (outlined in
Table 6 previously) are incurred due to investor perceptions of
regulatory risk as a result of the material amendment of the
policy. However, these higher costs are somewhat offset by the
reduced LGC liability between 2017 and 2021 as a result of
lower LRET targets relative to current legislation.13

Our results for the two scenarios identiﬁed above are presented

in Fig. 12.

Fig. 12 shows the costs and beneﬁts associated with signiﬁ-
cantly amending the LRET. While lower LGC costs are incurred in

12 As our analysis is for the NEM, we have reduced the LGC liability in our
modeling by 10% to reﬂect that the Western Australian and Northern Territory LGC
liabilities are not relevant (around 10% of national electricity demand).

pricing in 2017 ($64.32/MWh compared to $55/MWh for 2015 energy futures contracts available at the time of writing). For our modeling, we have used the actual yearly
estimates produced through our partial equilibrium analysis (rather than the cost of a CCGT or average wholesale prices).

both scenarios, the higher wholesale energy costs, as identiﬁed in
Table 6, are greater. The end result is a net cost to the consumer of
$51 million (NPV 2012$) if the LRET is effectively repealed. Of
course, the costs associated with this scenario would ultimately
dissipate, while the beneﬁts would more than likely be sustained.
And so over the very long run, these results might reverse,
although this is dependent upon Australia's policy of repealing
the LRET being consistent with global trends (which based upon
evidence presented in Section 2 appears somewhat unlikely). But
over the period of our examination, that is, from 2012 to 2021,
there would be a net cost to consumers from repealing the policy,
even with a grandfathering of existing projects. If the LRET target
was reduced to change with ﬂuctuating demand, the net cost to
consumers was found to be $119 million (NPV 2012$) over the
period 2012–2021. While these results appear counter-intuitive,
they are a simple function of the fact that there are real costs
associated with policy uncertainty.

7. Policy recommendations

In its ﬁnal report, the Climate Change Authority recommended
no material changes be made to the LRET policy. A key ﬁnding of
this article is that this ﬁnding is robust. Material amendments to
the policy would result in heightened uncertainty in relation to
energy policy with resultant costs being applied by ﬁnanciers of
power generation, and a further widening of the theoretical to
actual prices. According to the modelling presented here, these
costs would manifest themselves as higher costs to consumers –
up to $119 million (NPV 2012$) between 2017 and 2021, and
sharper run-up in LRET prices when shortages inevitably occur.14

14 We acknowledge the somewhat arbitrary nature of modeling between 2017
and 2021. However, we expect that analysis beyond 2021 would not be relevant
given that higher costs applied by project ﬁnanciers would eventually abate.

We have not considered the merits of ﬁrst principle public policy
objectives in relation to large-scale renewable energy policy.
Instead, we have looked at the market as it exists today and found
that amendment of the policy framework designed to alleviate
pricing pressures would be a more expensive option for electricity
consumers and society than leaving the current policy in place.
Investors in power generation require stable policy frameworks
and amendment to a policy which is designed to underpin
infrastructure investment for the next 20 years will not be
welcomed by most investors. International Power (reported in
Maher, 2012) drew the obvious conclusion

“Over $6 billion of investment has to date been made in renewable
generation and investors (both Australian and international) have
relied on the RET legislation remaining in full force and effect.
Stable legislation (and regulation) is required for large scale
capital intensive infrastructure whether this is renewable genera-
tion and/or fossil-ﬁred generation. If legislation is changed, then it
sets a worrying precedent that the legislative/regulatory goalposts
will be moved again and again over the next 20 to 30 years.”

In addition to our broad conclusions in relation to policy
certainty, we believe the dynamic discussed by Riesz and
Tourneboeuf (2012) in relation to uncertainties about gas pricing
requires greater consideration. Policymakers should have regard to
all of the factors which may result in wholesale energy price
pressures when considering the merits of renewable energy. The
nature of the NEM with its uniform, ﬁrst-price, energy-only gross
pool auction design means that plant with very low short-run
marginal costs (such as wind farms) have little or even negative
impacts on pool prices. Conversely, the cost structure of a gas-ﬁred
plant is a direct function of the gas price. Our research has shown
that a signiﬁcant increase in gas prices could result in gas-ﬁred
plant becoming more expensive than wind. We do not make
conclusions about the likelihood of this occurring, only that
renewable energy with no fuel cost should be contrasted with
gas in this environment.

Fig. 13 shows indices for gas prices and capital expenditure for
wind, OCGT and CCGT for the period 2000 to 2011. There are
several conclusions that can be drawn by policy makers in relation
to future pricing. Firstly, wind turbine prices are trending down
while gas prices are trending up. Secondly, capital expenditure
trends for OCGT, CCGT and wind are relatively similar.
It is
reasonable to state that the most recent pricing for turbines is
likely to be temporary given the somewhat unusually high $A
driven by international investor appetite for Australian denomi-
nated sovereign debt.15 The trends in Fig. 13 appear consistent
with those presented by US researchers (see Bolinger and Wiser,
2011).
In this context, and given the net cost to society of
amending the LRET policy, it would appear prudent to maintain
existing policy commitments.

8. Conclusion

This article has found that ongoing uncertainty in relation to
the future of large-scale renewable energy policy in Australia is
preventing the LGC market from operating efﬁciently. Our survey
of market participants conﬁrms that buyers and sellers of LGCs are
concerned about the potential for further legislative change and
this concern is manifesting itself in poor pricing and capital
allocation decision making. Arbitrage opportunities clearly exist
but no party is willing to clear the arbitrage based on battle-
hardened historical experience. Based upon the modelling pre-
sented in this article, our conclusion is clear – material amend-
ments to the LRET would result in net costs to consumers of
between $51 million and $119 million (2012$). Based upon this
conclusion, our recommendation is that the LRET should remain in
place and without amendment if conﬁdence in the policy is to be
restored. It is important to note that bipartisan support for the
policy continues as indicated by recent statements by political

been falling while the Australian dollar had concurrently remained unusually
strong.

leaders such as, ‘There's a review coming but we remain committed
to the Renewable Energy Target’ (Hunt, 2012).16

Importantly, many of the conclusions made as a result of our
survey of market participants appear consistent with previous and
similar studies.
In our view, ROAM Consulting expressed the
requirement for consistency as well as any:

“a good outcome from the biennial review would be to leave the
LRET to function in its current form. Uncertainty about the future
of the scheme is a signiﬁcant issue, and there was consensus that
investor conﬁdence will return only if the legislation goes through
the review with no changes. Furthermore, the review should be
done as quickly as possible and released as quickly as possible
once complete.” (ROAM Consulting, 2012, p. 56).

Target

The Australian Government has set an ambitious target that at least 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity
needs will be met by Renewable Energy (RE) sources by 2020. Given the limited use of RE sources for
electricity generation, this national Renewable Energy Target (RET) leaves state, territory and municipal
governments in a challenging policy position. In this article, we examine the Australian state of
Queensland where RE provides approximately 4 per cent of the region’s electricity supplies. The research
utilizes stakeholder theory to examine the developmental barriers, targets, policies and actions identiﬁed
by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations in the RE industry sector. The results from our analysis show that
RE developments face a range of socio-technical barriers that require timely actions in the areas of
ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure enhancement, regulation reform, community-centred developments,
technology and workforce investments, and information and education programs. Also, in the context of
RE planning, while the national RET is the preferred setting, the differences between Queensland’s RE
installed generation capacity and electricity supply targets require clariﬁcation and agreement.

1. Introduction

In 2009, the Australian government legislated a Renewable
Energy Target (RET) of 20 per cent by 2020 (i.e. approximately
45,000 GWh of RE sourced electricity) in-line with its national plan
for a clean energy future [1,2]. While the plan is aimed at directly
mitigating the impacts of climate change, the ﬂow down of this
target and the development of Renewable Energy (RE) supply at the
state, territory and municipal
levels of government presents
a signiﬁcant challenge [3,4]. Accordingly, the impositions of a poor
RE development framework for RE asset construction and deploy-
ment may render the national RET unachievable in the remaining
timeframe.

Important in the context of our study, the policy opportunities
that have been canvassed by various researchers and RE advocates
provide a series of policy prescriptions and actions that support the
achievement of the RET and any state-level targets [5]. These
initiatives can take various forms, including RE Portfolio Standards
(RPS), government tendering of RE projects, tax beneﬁts for RE

assets purchase and depreciation, and voluntary green power
markets. However,
the selection of RET enabling actions,
commencement of the Australian carbon pricing legislation in mid
2012, and the relatively short 10-year timeframe for meeting the
national RET, presents some immediate challenges for domestic
governments [2,6].

In this investigation, the views of ﬁrms and stakeholder orga-
nizations confronted with RE policies and governmental actions in
the Australian state of Queensland are the primary subject of our
analysis. In sum, we seek to answer three major research questions.
First, what are the barriers and impediments to increasing RE in
national regions and states? Some studies show that RE solutions
often face difﬁcult technical, institutional and economic problems
and impediments (e.g. poor ﬁnancing arrangements, high technical
risks, unhelpful regulation,
In
a pragmatic sense, understanding the various contextual impedi-
ments faced by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations would be
instructive for researchers and industry practitioners. Second,
should state or regional governments establish targets for RE
supply? For example, while some countries apply targets to speciﬁc
RE sources (e.g. wind, solar, biomass) [11e14], Australia allows its
states and regions to establish their own renewable energy plans,
policies and targets (e.g. the New South Wales (NSW) state
government has adopted the national RET as its target [4]. In
tracking its progress, a recent independent audit of NSW electricity

faulty market systems) [7e9].

supply showed that 6.8 per cent of that state’s electricity supply is
currently being met by RE sources, while electricity prices have
risen by 6 per cent due to generators’ RET commitments) [15].
However, other studies show that striving to meet an RET might
result in the creation of multiple policy and regulatory instruments
[12] while also delivering less positive outcomes,
including
increased unemployment and reduced energy security [14]. Given
this background, it is important to understand the beneﬁts and
problems associated with setting state-level RETs. Finally, what
actions should states and regions take in order to meet national
level RETs? Our extant RE literature argues successfully that various
government policies and actions can aid the growth of RE supplies
in regions and countries [16,17]. However, in our case we are
speciﬁcally examining the views and recommendations of ﬁrms
and stakeholder organizations that have an exposure to the
development of RE sourced electricity in the state of Queensland.
Hence, the summation of responses to these questions enables
understanding of the context, appropriateness of state-level RETs,
and policies and actions that support RE supply expansion.

The balance of our paper is developed as follows. In the next
section we will discuss and contrast some of the critical RE litera-
ture and theory related to our study, including a detailed expla-
nation of the research setting. Next, the study will describe our
structured research method, including the data collection and
analysis procedures, followed by a presentation of the results and
their discussion. Our concluding statements highlight the impor-
tance of understanding what barriers and actions ﬁrms and
stakeholder organizations consider to be important for the growth
of RE supply, while noting the research limitations.

2. Building renewable energy supply e Barriers, targets,
policies and actions

The literature explicating the barriers to RE growth provides an
array of socio-technical problems and hurdles that confront ﬁrms
and industries [7e9,18]. In some instances, the problems can take
a strong behavioural form, such as the lack of awareness or infor-
mation to make sound judgments and decisions within the ﬁrm
[18], while in other circumstances the impediments might be based
on poor policy, administrative process or regulatory systems design
that deny generators adequate business opportunities [8,9,19].
Other barriers to the advancement of RE supply can take the form of
unhelpful and poorly designed energy markets [19,20]; sub-
optimal research and development, heightened technical risks,
and limited innovation and knowledge creation in the ﬁeld of RE
systems [8,18,21,22]; and, inadequate RE investment incentives and
project ﬁnancing arrangements [5,11,23,24]. In a collective sense,
despite the substantial number of identiﬁed impediments across
the RE literature, disciplinary experts are conﬁdent that these
barriers may ﬁnd some level of resolution with the delivery of
suitable policies and actions [12,14,16,17]. In this study, the barriers
identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations should allow us
to understand the larger RE business context and operational
impediments to meeting the national RET.

Foundation studies show that RETs form part of the larger set of
RE issues [21]. In particular, the literature shows that RE schemes
can take a quantitative position (e.g. RETs, quota systems for green
certiﬁcate trading, bidding and auction systems for carbon credits)
or a more price directed stance (e.g. Feed-in Tariffs (FiT), carbon
it is considered quite
pricing mechanisms) [25]. Accordingly,
appropriate that RETs, and possibly targets at the state, regional and
municipal
form part of a successful RE development
framework [4,26,27]. The more global views of RETs, shows us that
possibly 10e50 per cent of our primary energy needs will be met
through RE sources by 2050 [27]. Speciﬁc to this study, an overview

levels,

of global RETs shows a range of RE sourced electricity generation
targets from 20 to 35 per cent by 2020, stretching out to increas-
ingly more optimistic targets and outcomes of 50e80 per cent by
2050 [27]. We also noted that these types of aspirational RETs can
sometimes be set at less challenging (more easily achievable) levels
in smaller countries (e.g. 3 per cent) [28], while also requiring the
application of a strict deﬁnition to assure target efﬁcacy (e.g. share
of RE sourced electricity generation is based on actual supply or
production not installed capacity) [10,25]. However, despite some
of the intricacies in setting RETs, we would argue that under-
standing the types of state-level targets that might be established,
and the utility of these targets for ﬁrms and stakeholder organi-
zations, will assist and inform the development of effective policies
and actions.

Government policies and actions represent the engine room for
RE supply development [16,17]. Some of our earlier studies in RE
technology show us that appropriate policies can act as the glue
that supports positive linkages and actions between institutions
and actors in communities [21,29]. Indeed, some researchers depict
the relationship between policy and actions as simply: “if we
establish a speciﬁc RE policy goal, then we need distinct programs and
technologies to accomplish this” [21,29]. Several other studies point
to the requirement for effective policies that offer government
assistance packages (where required), investment and ﬁnancial
incentives arrangements, workable policies for RE FiT, cooperative
working systems for private and public organizations, industry
development and equipment manufacturing assistance, and stim-
ulants
innovation and design
systems
[5,8,22e24,30]. Importantly, these types of policy levers can serve
as high level frameworks for actions and activities that support the
growth and advancement of RE assets, infrastructure, supply and
equipment manufacturing [7,13,23,24,26,31]. In this study, we are
seeking to explore and expose the types of policies and actions,
identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations, which may
enable the state of Queensland to meet its obligation under the
national RET.

3. Renewable energy supply in Queensland e An overview

Earlier studies that focused on RE generation in Australia
depicted a slow and cautious start for the country [32]. The original
2001 national RET was modest seeking only a nominal 2 per cent of
RE supply by 2010, thereby equating to 9500 GWh of electricity
from renewable sources [32]. Also, other studies suggested that
Australian RE supply developments could beneﬁt from repricing
electricity and taking account of carbon-based pollution and other
environmental impacts from its dominant coal ﬁred power gener-
ators [33]. Arguably, these types of electricity price adjustments
could potentially stimulate further interest and investment in RE
projects across Australia.

The most recent studies from researchers, and the Australian
government, show RE sourced electricity generation in Australia
totalling approximately 7 per cent, with abundant fossil fuels still
serving as the primary energy source for the country [34,35]. In
addition, the latest energy supply trends show that Queensland
ranks third in overall RE installed generation capacity behind NSW
and Victoria. Accordingly, in order to meet the national RET, each
state and territory must play an active role in developing RE
supplies.

Queensland is Australia’s second largest state covering over 1.9
million square kilometres of land and home to over 4.5 million
citizens [36]. The state economy is based on strong mineral
resources (mainly coal, bauxite and copper) and tourism sectors,
with primary industry production of beef, bananas, sugar cane,
pineapples, peanuts, grains, cotton and wool. The state economy is

N.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127

121

founded on competitively priced electricity inputs that are
primarily supplied by various coal ﬁred power stations built during
the 1980e2000 period [37]. However, this results in Queensland
having the highest per capita carbon emissions of all the Australian
states and territories [37].

Queensland is also one of six interconnected regions that supply
approximately A$11 billion worth of electricity under a National
Electricity Market (NEM) that was created in 1998 [38]. The
Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) uses a centrally
controlled dispatch process to schedule and match electricity
producer outputs and consumer usage in a spot price market,
where Australian electricity laws and rules provide the operational
framework. NEM regulation is provided by the Australian Energy
Market Commission (managing the rule making process and
assessing proposed rule changes) and the Australian Energy
Regulator (monitoring and enforcement of rules and law compli-
ance). Importantly, the AEMO has stated that the current RET
will lead to changes in the mix of electricity supply sources and
location origins in the coming years, including RE supply from
Queensland [39].

In response to the national RET, the Queensland government
established the Ofﬁce of Clean Energy (OCE) in early 2009 to
administer the Queensland Renewable Energy Plan (QREP) [40].
The QREP applies to smallemedium and large scale RE develop-
ments (for the retail distribution and high voltage service provider
networks, respectively) and provides the high level framework for
the state to achieve its share of the national RET, estimated at
2500 MW installed capacity or 9000 GWh of electricity supply [40].
In executing the QREP, the Queensland government has moved
forward with several initiatives and projects as follows.

3.1. Biomass

Sugar cane waste (or bagasse) provides approximately 70 per
cent of the state’s RE supplies. The state government provided A$9
million, from its A$50 million Queensland Renewable Energy Fund
(QREF), for the development of Mackay Sugar’s energy cogenera-
tion plant at the Racecourse Mill near Mackay, North Queensland.
In addition to serving the current energy needs of the mill (65 MW),
the replacement plant will deliver an extra 27 MW of capacity to
the state electricity grid commencing in 2013.

3.2. Solar (hot water and photovoltaic)

The high levels of solar resources in Queensland (known as the
‘Sunshine State’) provide signiﬁcant opportunities for solar power
generation and deployment. The Queensland Solar Bonus Scheme
has seen over 30,000 customers install roof top photovoltaic (PV)
systems (with a 44 cents per kWh residential gross FiT applied), and
over 100 MW installed capacity during 2008e2010. The state
government supplemented this with the Queensland Solar Homes
Program where a bulk purchase of solar panels allowed 1000
homes to be ﬁtted with PV systems.

A state solar initiatives package valued at A$115 million is being
used to fund projects such as Virtual Solar Power Stations
(500 MW) in towns and communities (using PV and solar hot water
systems); the A$60 million Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme
(A$600e1000 per solar hot water installations); the A$5.8 million
PV system installation program for 420 kindergartens; the A$9.9
million Solar Sport and Communities initiative to support solar
systems installations in sports clubs and community organizations;
and, the A$35.4 million for the Kogan Creek Solar Thermal systems
installation.

In addition, the state government has also invested A$60 million
in the Solar and Energy Efﬁciency in State Schools program that will

see over 1250 schools ﬁtted with PV systems, and provided another
A$4 million for the Wide Bay Community solar farm to power
health services facilities in the Hervey Bay region. The state has also
provided A$5 million for Townsville’s participation in the federal
Solar Cities Program, while A$6.6 million has been allocated from
the QREF for solar roof top arrays at the Carrara Gold Coast stadium
and the University of Queensland campus, and a solar atlas (radi-
ation recording) project in western Queensland.

At the national level, in June 2011 the Solar Dawn Consortium
was awarded a federal Solar Flagships program grant to build
a 250 MW solar thermal and gas hybrid plant (85 per cent or
212 MW of renewable energy capacity) near Chinchilla in western
Queensland to commence operations in 2015 [41].

3.3. Hydro

The state operates

three small hydroelectricity stations
(167 MW) at Barron Gorge, Koombooloomba and Kareeya in North
Queensland. The Queensland government is currently engaged in
a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Papua New Guinea (PNG)
government, PNG Energy Developments Limited and Origin Energy,
to facilitate development of a large hydroelectricity project on the
Purari River in PNG. Electricity will be supplied to the NEM through
subsea transmission lines that connect
to Townsville, North
Queensland.

3.4. Wind

The Windy Hill wind farm in north Queensland has 12 MW of
installed capacity. AGL Limited has bought the development rights
to the Coopers Gap wind farm site which has an estimated 500 MW
generation capacity. The OCE has also published a wind map iden-
tifying which areas might be suitable for energy generation projects.

3.5. Geothermal

The state has provided A$15 million for the Queensland
Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence. The centre is a research
and development hub that will examine opportunities to generate
geothermal energy using new turbine, cooling tower and heat
exchanger designs; power transmission and network modelling;
and reservoir exploration and management.
In addition, A$5
million from the QREF has been allocated to investigate and identify
suitable hot rock formations in close proximity to existing high
voltage transmission networks.

3.6. Wave and tidal

The state has provided two small research and development
grants to a total of A$0.28 million to assist in building concept
demonstrators for a ﬂoating wave power generator and a tidal
turbine system.

Importantly, these QREP activities have seen the RE sourced
electricity generation capacities of Queensland grow by 29 per cent
over 2008e2010. Table 1 shows a comparison of the installed RE
capacity for the period 2008e2010 and the 2020 target. While this
growth in installed capacity has merit, the supply of electricity from
RE sources is still well below the 20 per cent target. The state
government advised that in 2010, the total electricity generation
capacity in Queensland was 14,500 MW with coal and gas ﬁred
power stations accounting for 87 per cent of the capacity. While
Queensland’s RE sourced electricity generation capacity was
approximately 7 per cent of total state capacity, only 4 per cent of the
state’s actual electricity supply was provided by renewable sources

due to the lack of renewable resources availability [42]. Hence, as
we noted from earlier studies, the difference between installed
generation capacity and actual electricity supply targets will need
clariﬁcation and agreement in the context of the QREP [10,25].

However, this is not the only problem facing the Queensland
government. The success of the QREP, and meeting the state’s
obligation under the national RET, is predicated on securing A$3.5
billion of the A$12 billion RE investments target set by the federal
[1,2]. Hence, under the current global ﬁnancial
government
conditions, ﬁnding over A$3 billion worth of investments for state
RE projects may not be easy in the immediate to medium term [43].
Given this context, understanding some of the practical barriers to
the
RE developments; how state-level RETs might support
achievement of the legislated national RET; and, what actions and
policies might prove effective in delivering higher levels of RE
supply would appear instructive and important. We would also
argue that looking at these issues through the lens of ﬁrms and
stakeholder organizations involved in the RE industry should create
a block of highly pragmatic and applicative knowledge.

4. Methodology

4.1. Data sources and collection

The data was collected on 30 October 2011 from the Queensland
government web pages that were established for the inquiry into
‘Growing Queensland’s Renewable Energy Electricity Sector’, con-
ducted by the state’s Environment and Resources Committee [44].
The committee was tasked to examine and report on ‘the oppor-
tunities and challenges for the Queensland Government associated
with increasing the proportion of electricity generated from renewable
energy sources in Queensland’ [44]. Importantly, the scope of this
inquiry provided the ﬁrm and stakeholder organization data for our
study (i.e. responses on RE development barriers, state-level RETs,
and policies and actions that support RE expansion). Data in the
form of written submissions from executives and managers in ﬁrms
and stakeholder government and non-government organizations
(GOs and NGOs) were collected and catalogued. A summary of the
44 ﬁrms and organizations is presented in Table 2.

4.2. Research technique and analysis

A qualitative research method has been used for this study in
order to collect, structure, and analyse the written submissions
from ﬁrms, GOs and NGOs [45,46]. The study is consistent with
other stakeholder inquiries where written statements related to
a primary issue of concern are individually and collectively ana-
lysed [47e49]. The study’s data structure has been created to
accurately trace ﬁrm and stakeholder organization responses to
questions associated with barriers to RE supply expansion, state-
level RETs, and policies and actions for RE developments, under the
precise scope of the government inquiry [44,50].

In order to structure, analyse and manage our data, we created
a research database using MS Access software [50]. The written
content was extracted and allocated to one of three speciﬁc data-
base structures (i.e. barriers, state-level RETs, and policies and
actions) to maintain data traceability and assure analytical integrity
[45,46,50]. A total of 335 statements were analysed and categorized
(e.g. ﬁnancial,
infrastructure, technical, regulatory) during the
course of the study. Following this procedure, the results from each
data structure was summarised and the highest ranked categories
presented in the discussion of results.

5. Results and discussion

5.1. Barriers to regional renewable energy supply growth

Firms and stakeholder organizations identiﬁed a range of
ﬁnancial,
regulatory, economic, and
information barriers to RE supply growth in Queensland. A
summary of the RE supply barriers are presented in Table 3.

infrastructure,

technical,

The six categories of barriers cover 87 per cent of all responses
and are consistent with much of the RE literature [18,51]. A group of
ﬁnance-related issues provided the most prominent barrier to the
growth of RE supply in Queensland. Firms and stakeholders stated
that the high capital costs associated with large scale RE projects in
remote regions dampened potential investments (e.g. the federal
solar ﬂagships program round one winning projects will build
a 250 MW solar thermal gas hybrid power plant in western
Queensland, and a 150 MW solar farm in western New South Wales,
at a cost of more than A$2 billion) [41]. Also, the lack of suitable
longer term ﬁnancial
incentives in the form of state-level
commercial FiT, government and taxation subsidies, favourable RE
(green) certiﬁcate pricing levels, and RE systems purchase rebate
schemes were also highlighted as major impediments to increased
RE sourced electricity supply. Our investigations also show that the
current contracting ﬁscal climate in Australia [52], and the inability
to negotiate proﬁtable long-term (25e30 year) Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) with government businesses and private power
companies are acting as barriers to RE developments [53].

The second major set of barriers is concentrated on the avail-
ability of suitably robust and proximately located infrastructure. In
relation to large scale RE developments,
federal government
studies show that much of the state network is established in
a narrow corridor running along the eastern seaboard of the state,
and well away from the rich solar and wind resources in far west
and far northern Queensland [35]. Also, a public admission by the
state government’s Energy Minister that the retail electricity
network possesses insufﬁcient capacity to cope with new small and
medium scale solar power installations reinforces the views pre-
sented by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations [54]. It should be
noted that these infrastructure barriers also come with signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial expenditure, given the substantial costs associated with
the high voltage and retail electricity networks’ upgrades.

The technical barriers identiﬁed by the ﬁrms and stakeholders
provide a signiﬁcant challenge. First, while energy storage and
relocation devices, such as hydrogen cells, combined heat and
power, compressed air, pumped hydro, new and old battery, super
capacitor, and superconductor systems, continue along their
development pathways [55,56]; much of the state’s remotely
located RE sources requires technical storage and relocation
mechanisms to support their operation and control intermittency
of power delivery to the grid. Pivotally, the state government has
admitted that the emerging development of storage and control
technologies will assist with delivering RE developments in the
future [40]. Second, the ability to maintain a competent technical
workforce and skills base is difﬁcult under the current economic
conditions. The current sustained mining and resources boom in
Australia is a positive drain on skilled technical workers and
undermines the development of a stable RE industry workforce
[52]. In sum, these technical issues pose a serious challenge to
enlarged RE supply in the immediate to medium term.

Firms and stakeholder organizations assert that the regulatory
hurdles to enhanced RE supply provide an administrative and legal
impost to future developments. As an example, a review of the state
RE project development process highlights three major electricity
levels) gateways; three levels of
industry (state and national
government planning and approvals legislation, including a six part
project development assessment system; separate water and vege-
tation, environmental, and indigenous culture and heritage testing
protocols; and land leasing and/or acquisition procedures [57].
Accordingly, the framework for RE regulation established by the state
and municipal governments provides an extensive and time inten-
sive set of complex business processes for new RE supply projects.

As we noted earlier, the abundance of black coal resources for
energy generation in Queensland is the backbone of relatively
cheap electricity as a fundamental input to a vibrant state economy
[36,37]. In-line with earlier studies, responses suggest that the
absence of pricing carbon pollution into electricity is seen as
a barrier to the delivery of capital intensive RE projects [33]. In
addition, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations also argued that the
lack of RE information services and targeted education and

124

awareness programs for businesses and consumers continues to
hinder expanded RE supply.

Building RE supply in Queensland.

5.2. The issue of state-level RETs

Over 57 per cent of ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations who
commented on the issue of state-level RETs argued that the
Queensland government should maintain its current QREP target,
and remain wholly consistent with the national RET [2,40]. The
principal argument for maintaining this target was to ensure that
the lowest cost solutions (projects) for RE supply were obtained
over the immediate and longer term (i.e. no distorted, higher cost
RE project approvals in order to meet regional or location based
targets). As an example, power ﬁrm Origin Energy typiﬁed this
position in their inquiry submission:

“Origin does not recommend that the Queensland Government set
a state speciﬁc obligation target around renewables. The main
reason for this position is that there should be no distortion of the
national RET. The building of the renewable generation ﬂeet should
not be artiﬁcially forced into speciﬁc geographical locations (or
speciﬁc technologies) by the introduction of a Queensland target, as
it will increase costs to customers” (Origin Energy, 30 June 2010).

Importantly, the majority of ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
asserted that all RE supply projects should be based on an
economically sound and responsible business case.

In other minority views, approximately 13 per cent of responses
suggested that the state government should support community
development through the application of regional based RETs (e.g.
20 per cent RE supply for seaboard (current grid) communities, and
50 per cent renewable energy supply for remote communities, by
2020); while another 13 per cent argued that improved sustain-
ability outcomes required more challenging state-level RETs
ranging from 23 to 40 per cent RE supply for Queensland by 2020.
In these cases, ﬁrms and organizations argued that RETs and
projects should be largely focused on regional and sustainable
development in Queensland.

5.3. Building renewable energy supply e Regional policies and
actions

Firms and stakeholder organizations identiﬁed seven major
areas of activity that might increase RE supply in Queensland. A
summary of the policies and actions, covering 88 per cent of all
responses, are presented in Table 4.

RE ﬁnance activities and actions attracted the highest level of
attention from ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations. In particular,
ﬁnancial incentives in the form of a large commercial scale gross FiT
and suitable tax breaks (e.g. accelerated asset depreciation, goods
and services tax rebates) to support large to medium RE asset
investments, were seen as attractive mechanisms for increasing the
number of RE supply projects and initiatives. Robust FiT structures
have been identiﬁed as important ﬁnancial
incentives for RE
investments [58]. As an example, solar PV and hot water ﬁrm The
Solar Guys argued for the implementation of a large commercial
scale gross solar FiT:

“Intelligent, long-term incentive mechanisms like feed-in tariffs
have been poorly implemented. A case in point is the Queensland
Solar Bonus Scheme e an instantaneous net solar feed-in tariff
scheme. A problem with the Queensland Solar Bonus Scheme is that
it doesn’t allow large consumers of power to participate and is
effectively limited to residential and light commercial customers.
Queensland government actions - establish a commercial and
industrial gross solar feed-in tariff” (The Solar Guys, 28 June 2010).

One of the difﬁculties facing the Queensland government,
should it seek to act on the issue of taxation, is that the federal
government’s Australian Taxation Ofﬁce retains overall responsi-
bility for business taxation law drafting and implementation [59].
Accordingly, this type of ﬁnancial incentive would require cross-
jurisdictional legal consultations and approvals [4]. Also, while
the state government is providing over A$200 million in grants and
funding for various RE supply projects, responses suggest that this
level of commitment needs to be increased in order to meet the
desired QREP outcomes. As noted earlier, the high costs associated
with RE projects in remote parts of Queensland would dictate this
as a prudent action [35].

As a further measure, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
asserted that the state government should take a more active role
in facilitating PPAs for RE developments. In the current process, the
Queensland government does not involve itself in any commercial
bargaining or negotiations between the state-owned electricity
generation (e.g. CS Energy, Stanwell Corporation) and retail (e.g.
Energex, Ergon Energy) companies and prospective RE developers
[57]. In essence, as in other studies, state government involvement
with PPA negotiations may smooth and increase the velocity of the
development process [60].

While high voltage network enhancements and remote grid
connections were identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
as important actions for RE supply, current and future planning
shows that Powerlink, the Queensland government-owned, high
voltage electricity transmission network service provider, has
allocated approximately A$250 million for eleven electricity
network replacement
(substation and transformer
renewals on the 275 kV backbone and smaller 132 kV links) over
2013e2017 [61]. In addition, two of sixteen proposed network
connections for the period 2013e2017 will service RE generation
plants in more remote locations (a proposed far northern
Queensland wind farm and the Solar Dawn 250 MW solar and gas
hybrid plant in western Queensland) [61]. We also found that in the

actions

125

retail electricity network, Energex and Ergon Energy are spending
A$15.6 billion over 2010e2015 to reinforce and increase the
capacity of the local distribution networks [62,63]. While recent
studies have highlighted the importance of grid reinforcement and
connections to RE supply, we acknowledge that future network
reinforcement, connections and capacity enhancements will be
dependent on the location of generation plants, and the economic
viability of the proposed network upgrade [64].

The suggestion by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations to
review and reform the RE planning and approvals process has
signiﬁcant merit. In a typical response, infrastructure developer
Transﬁeld Holdings made this point in their submission:

“Transﬁeld agrees with the broad selection of actions the Queens-
land Government could take to encourage investment in the
generation and cogeneration of electricity from renewable energy
sources. We would encourage the Committee to implement regu-
latory reforms to cut red tape for renewable energy projects
including the streamlining local government approval processes”
(Transﬁeld Holdings, 30 June 2010).

The difﬁculty facing prospective RE developers is that genera-
tion plants must comply with three different layers of planning
legislation [40]. As an example, renewable energy supply projects
must comply with the federal Environment Conservation and
Biodiversity Conservation Act
(1999), while also maintaining
compliance with the state’s Integrated Planning Act (1997), Envi-
ronmental Protection Act (1994) and Electricity Act (1994). Further
separate municipal council land-use regulations and approvals are
also applicable to RE projects. In response to these identiﬁed
impediments, the state government is moving to improve the
regulatory framework through its ‘Green Door’ initiative that uses
an integrated development assessment system to screen and
analyse the planning, ecological, economic and community well-
being aspects of the project, and fast track the development
through joint state and municipal council case management teams
[65]. In addition, the state has amended the Land Act (1994) to
allow lease holders to provide sub-lease access to RE supply ﬁrms
and developers [66]. As noted in other studies, these types of
regulatory process modiﬁcations are essential for the streamlining
and smoothing of RE supply projects and investments [67].

Developing clean energy communities using RE supply projects
was highlighted as a key action for the state government. Firms and
stakeholder organizations argue that the creation of RE districts and
zones, community ownership schemes, off-grid systems for remote
communities, and the fulﬁlment of community service obligations
using RE supplies are critical measures for growing the state’s RE
sourced electricity. In recent times, the state government has
identiﬁed some potential districts including southwest, central, far
west and far north regions of Queensland where community
development and services delivery could be progressed using RE
supply projects and initiatives (e.g. PV systems, solar hot water units,
small turbine wind energy systems) [68]. Importantly, in these cases
the integration of the RE supply sources with the community
provides local control and development autonomy beneﬁts that
may otherwise not exist, particularly in remote communities [69].
While the Queensland government has commenced funding
some research in the area of geothermal and wave/tidal energy
resources, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations suggest that more
funds need to be allocated to RE technology research and proof-of-
concept commercialization efforts. As an example, energy retailer
Energex argued that more state funding was required for RE tech-
nology research and commercial development:

“ENERGEX would like to see increased focus on the development of
cost effective energy storage devices. These devices would allow the

intermittent energy output from renewable generation to be stored
locally and then returned to the network when needed (at times of
peak demand). This technology would assist in reducing the need
for retail network upgrades” (Energex, 30 June 2010).

We support ﬁndings in other studies that show technology
research and commercial development funding is an identiﬁed
cornerstone of RE supply growth [8,21,23]. Speciﬁc to this study,
funding and supporting RE research and development, particularly
in areas of energy storage and relocation technologies, should
enable the state to keep a number of resource site and commercial
development options available in the longer term [40].

Growth in RE technical skills was also seen as a key driver of
enhanced RE supply. Accordingly, the QREP target of 3500 new RE
industry jobs by 2020 will require a repositioning of some state-
level employment and training,
jobs marketing, and tertiary
education programs in order to focus on critical RE skills develop-
ment [40]. While the target may be achievable in the longer term,
the high growth mining and resources sector will continue to
absorb large numbers of technically trained personnel
in the
immediate to medium term [52].

Firms and stakeholder organizations also considered that clear
long-term RE investment policies, including the pricing of carbon
into goods and services provision, would bring greater certainty to
the electricity market and support more RE developments (e.g. the
Queensland Youth Environment Council proposed a state-based
carbon tax policy to make renewable energy investments more
attractive) [44]. In late 2011, the Australian federal government
passed legislation to establish a price on carbon emissions, and
deliver transitional and investment assistance to the electricity
industry in order to close high pollution plants and stimulate
investment in clean energy generation [6]. These shifts in govern-
ment policy and legislation provide a framework that supports RE
supply growth and future developments.

Finally, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations considered the
information, education, knowledge and awareness
delivery of
programs to commercial businesses and individuals to be important
for RE supply growth. As an example, RE systems manufacturer
Conergy argued for improved community awareness and education:

“The Queensland Government needs to encourage investment in
renewable energy source electricity generation using a rounded
approach including community awareness and education to
promote the opportunities that the increased use of renewable
energy presents” (Conergy, 30 June 2010)

We note that information and awareness programs have long been
championed as a mechanism to grow RE supply chains [70]. However
in our study, responses suggested that the most efﬁcient way to
deliver these types of programs was to integrate them with existing
energy efﬁciency and savings programs at the state and federal level
(e.g. the Council of Australian Governments National Strategy on
Energy Efﬁciency) [71]. In sum, the combination of energy efﬁciency
and RE information should highlight the importance of using less
energy while having regard for green and RE resources.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have attempted to examine and identify the RE
supply growth barriers, targets, policies and actions that apply to
the state of Queensland in Australia. However, in pursuing this
research we must acknowledge some speciﬁc limitations of the
study and its method. First, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
were openly invited by the state government to provide comments
and evidence for the inquiry. Accordingly, we had no control over
the selection of participating organizations or their responses to the

126

N.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127

inquiry. Second, the study is based on a single state of Australia that
is unique in terms of its population size and distribution, economy,
and energy assets. Accordingly, while some of the research results
may apply to other similar regions and countries, other results
might not be easily generalized. Notwithstanding these limitations,
this study has made a contribution to our improved understanding
of what RE development barriers exist and what actions we must
take to overcome them.

First, after nearly 14 years of studying the barriers to RE devel-
opment and supply we note that many ﬁnancial, infrastructure,
technical, regulatory, economic, and information and education
barriers still exist in one form or another [7,21,26,51]. Our analysis
of ﬁrm and stakeholder organization responses showed that in
Queensland, RE supply projects face impediments in the form of
high capital costs, insufﬁcient ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure
deﬁciencies, shortfalls in technology and technical workforce
capacity, and high levels of complex multi-tiered regulation. These
results suggest that RE developments still have some way to go in
terms of solving the socio-technical problems that confront this
industry sector.

Second, while the majority of ﬁrms and stakeholder organiza-
tions preferred states and territories to work within the national RET
framework, there may be some value in applying targets for regional
development and improved sustainability outcomes. The results
show that some ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations see value in
using RE resources as a development conduit in regional and remote
communities. Similarly, a further group of responses suggested that
setting a higher level state RET would enable improved carbon
pollution reduction and sustainability outcomes. In any case, further
precision needs to be applied to the QREP in terms of its RE targets
for installed generation capacity or electricity supply.

Third, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations have provided the
government with a broad range of actions and measures to grow
Queensland’s RE supply. While some regulatory reform and tech-
nology research and commercialization funding has been delivered,
there is still more work to be done in the areas of establishing long-
term ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure planning and realization,
regulatory harmonization across the three tiers of government,
community-centred developments, and information, education
and awareness programs. We would argue that these actions will
need to ﬂow effectively and consistently over the next nine years if
the QREP 2020 targets are to be met.

In closing, we note that Australia’s clean energy future legisla-
tion was passed into law on 8 November 2011 [6]. Hence, we see
further opportunities to study Australia’s RE industry sector,
particularly during the period following the introduction of the
carbon tax in mid-2012. We consider that the longer term exami-
nation and analysis of RE developments in Australia should create
several new and informative tranches of knowledge.

Is Solar Sunshot Worth The Effort And Expense?

Given the massive scale of solar PV production elsewhere, especially in China, some have
questioned whether it’s a waste of money embarking on Solar Sunshot. ARENA acknowledges
we’re behind the eight-ball and expects it will take “some time” for Australian manufacturing to
become competitive on a global scale.

ARENA says the initiative will also support elements of the supply chain where Australia can be
most competitive, particularly given local access to abundant raw materials such as 
form of quartz

“We need to build on our history of innovation and extend this into manufacturing across the

solar supply chain,” 

said ARENA CEO Darren Miller

. “The demand for solar required to meet our

net zero and renewable energy superpower goals is immense and Australia has the opportunity

to build resilience and unlock long-term economic opportunity.”

I was told recently that Tindo panels, while manufactured in Australia, use predominantly Chinese
components. Just wondering if that is indeed true. I’m considering using Tindo panels…. But not if
they are being misleading on their origin.

Hi Graham,

Tindo assemble panels here in a factory that’s actually smaller than the experimental R&D
production line that Longi have in China. ie the chinese make 90% of the worlds solar and so
getting the components there isn’t something exceptional.

BP used to make solar here in Australia, if you remember Telecom remote area phone boxes
and the first solar car to cross Australia, they used BP cells. The plant they were made in
Sydney was taken over by Silex for a short time but then closed.

I can’t help but mention that the olympic village in Sydney had BP solar panels on it, while
Holden & the CSIRO developed a hybrid eCommodore 25 years ago. While John Howard spent
10 times more R&D money subsidising “clean coal” than he did on renewables. UNSW
developed the PERC technology used in most modern solar cells but as mentioned 90% are
made in China…

It’s worth considering Donald Horne’s full quote:

Australia is a lucky country… run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on
other people’s ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all
fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by
surprise.

It competes with lithium-ion rechargeable batteries in the electrification of Australian land transportation sector, and can provide an alternative energy storage medium for the greening of the country’s electrical grid system. This paper reviews the role hydrogen plays in the current government’s Net-Zero strategy, and investigates the potential role of other bioenergy sources. It is found that hydrogen and batteries play essentially complementary roles in reducing transport emissions, and that the former energy source is more suited to the operation of long-distance commercial service vehicles than batteries. It is suggested that bioenergy fuels such as biomethane, second generation biofuels and HVO can provide suitable bridging alternatives in the event that Australia’s EV strategy is unable to meet the 2030 target. Keywords: hydrogen; Australia’s net-zero strategy; energy transition; energy storage; hydrogen fuel cell; lithium-ion rechargeable battery  1. Introduction Climate change policy, in the form of the Paris Agreement, is driving a global change which is transforming the way we produce and use energy. The aim of this energy transition is to replace emissions-intensive fossil fuels with clean renewable energy sources in power generation and transportation systems to achieve global net – zero emissions by 2050. Australia’s efforts to tackle the challenge started with the former (coalition) government’s net-zero strategy, which was centred around a Technology Investment Roadmap which delivered 40% of the emission reductions. The current (Albanese) Labour government’s strategy has taken a bolder approach, with the 2030 reductions target increased to 43% and a concerted effort to phase out coal-fired power plants (the heaviest emitters) from Australia’s grid system.  Hydrogen plays a significant role in the strategies of both of these two consecutive governments. Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy was established in 2019, with the aims of developing a hydrogen industry that benefited all Australians and made the country a major player in the global hydrogen industry by 2030.  To see how hydrogen can play an integral part in achieving the emissions reduction targets of Australia, it is first necessary to obtain a clear picture of the country’s net-zero strategy. Other chemical and electro-chemical media such as biomethane and batteries are also instrumental in achieving the same goal, and it is instructive to compare the relative merits of these options.  This paper reviews the potential use of hydrogen and other bioenergy resources as clean energy options for power generation and transportation, and provides a critique of Australia’s net-zero strategy and the role bioenergy can play in the successful achievement of the 2050 target. In particular, it suggests the potential use of conventional bioenergy sources such as biomethane to complement hydrogen in the achievement of the 2030 goal.

It then outlines the former (Coalition) and the present (Albanese) government’s net-zero strategies, paying particular attention to the roles of the (reformed) Safeguard Mechanism and the (new) National EV Strategy in meeting the 2030 and 2050 targets.  The merits of hydrogen, biomethane and batteries are then compared. The paper ends by emphasizing the need for urgent action, and noting the possibility of the emergence of a technology gap in the absence of such action. It is pointed out that bioenergy fuels such as biomethane and second generation biofuels offer the opportunity to fill such a possible technology gap. 2. Hydrogen and Other Bioenergy Fuels for Power Sources Australia’s existing grid power systems depend largely on fossil fuel sources such as coal and gas for their dispatchable energy supply. To maintain grid stability during the greening process, these need to be replaced with renewable sources that are also dispatchable in nature. Intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar can be transformed into dispatchable sources for the grid through the mechanism of energy storage. Such sources include energy storage systems consisting of rechargeable batteries utilizing intermittent wind and solar energy as their energy source, as well as pumped hydro. The possibility of adding regenerative hydrogen fuel cells to this list of new dispatchable energy sources will become real as this technology comes of age.  The list of current and emerging clean and green energy options (either available or in development) for Australia’s power and transportation industries comprise: • Intermittent renewable energy for power generation (wind, solar) • Dispatchable clean energy for power generation (hydro, geothermal, ocean) • Bioenergy fuels for thermal power generation (solid biomass, biogas, biomethane, pyrolysis oils, firstgeneration biofuels, biobutanol, HVO, syngas, hydrogen and ammonia) [1]. • Energy storage systems for grid-greening and stabilization (wind-solar powered rechargeable batteries, pumped hydro, regenerative (reversible) hydrogen fuel cells (RHFCs)). • Rechargeable batteries for battery-powered EVs (BEVs), hydrogen fuel cells for fuel cell EVs (HFCEVs) (see [1], Ch. 7).  Most of these technologies are mature and market-ready. The latest additions are hydrogen and ammonia, which are in a near-market state of readiness.  RHFCs which have a roundtrip efficiency of 30%, still lag behind the 75-90% efficiency range for Li-ion batteries [2]. However, these two energy sources have similar return on investment at storing overgeneration, particularly from wind energy. A rechargeable battery that promises to be cheaper than Li-ion batteries is the sodium-ion battery. (See [1], Ch. 7.4 and [3]).  Like other bioenergy sources, hydrogen stores its energy in chemical form. Fuel cells typically use hydrogen as their fuel. This may be used in its pure form directly, or obtained from organic fuels such as natural gas and biogas through the process of external or internal reforming. The Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) is able to use methanol as the fuel directly. 3. The Role of Hydrogen in Australia’s Net-Zero Strategy 3.1. Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy (2019) In December 2018, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) established a working group, chaired by Chief Scientist Dr. Alan Finkel, to develop a strategy for “a hydrogen industry that benefits all Australians and is a major global player by 2030” [4].  The specific aim of this strategy was to “create, test and prove Australia’s clean hydrogen supply chains, encourage global markets and develop cost-competitive production capabilities”.  Hydrogen has many uses, ranging from the making of ammonia, which is used in the manufacture of fertilizers, explosives and plastics, to its better-known function in decarbonising energy systems. It is a zero-emission fuel for hydrogen fuel cell EVs (see [5], p.26) and storage systems Preprints.org (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 February 2024                   doi:10.20944/preprints202402.1588.v1 3  such as regenerative (reversible) hydrogen fuel cells, and can be blended with natural gas for cooking and heating uses (see Ref [4], p.5).  A key feature of Australia’s hydrogen strategy is the creation of hydrogen hubs, which are “regions where users of hydrogen are co-located – in metropolitan, regional and remote areas of Australia” (Ref [4], p.31).  The hydrogen strategy received a boost this year with the announcement by the government of a $2bn Hydrogen Headstart program to “make Australia a renewable energy superpower” by providing support for large-scale hydrogen projects [6]. 3.2. Australia’s Net-Zero Strategy Called Australia’s Long-Term Emissions Reduction Plan: A whole-of-economy plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the key feature of the previous (Coalition) government’s net-zero strategy was a Technology Investment Roadmap, which amounted to 40% of its total reductions, and sought to produce clean hydrogen, low-cost solar and energy storage as key technologies assisting the effort, as well as reducing emissions through producing low-emissions steel and aluminium and sequestering carbon through carbon capture and soil carbon ([7] and Ref [1] Table 13.6).  The current (Albanese) government’s strategy is still evolving. It consists of a government act and a suite of policies sometimes referred by the collective name of the Powering Australia Plan. The strategy comprises: • Climate Change Act 2022 [8], which is an umbrella legislation to implement Australia’s net-zero commitments, and includes the reduction of net GHG emissions to 43% below 2005 levels by 2030, and its reduction to net-zero by 2050, implemented by  • a raft of strategies known collectively as the Powering Australia Plan [9].  The key elements of the Powering Australia Plan consist of: • The Safeguard Mechanism – reducing the emission baselines of the 215 heavy-emitters on a broad trajectory to net zero by 2050. • National Electric Vehicle Strategy – improving the uptake, affordability and choice of electric vehicles by expanding the Australian EV market. • Rewiring the Nation – a $20 billion commitment to rebuild and modernize the grid to enable greater penetration of renewable energy. • Powering the regions fund – supporting industry to decarbonise and develop new clean industries, support workforce development and purchase carbon credit units (ACCUs) on behalf of the Commonwealth. • National Reconstruction Fund - $15 billion to diversify and transform Australia’s economy and industry. 3.3. The Safeguard Mechanism [10,11] The Safeguard mechanism is aimed at ensuring that the emissions from Australia’s 215 largest emitters (from the mining, manufacturing, transportation, oil, gas and waste sectors) reduce their (real) emissions in line with the government’s 2050 plan. Under the Abbot government, this scheme required the 215 facilities to hold their emissions below a 100,000 tonnes of CO2 eq. per annum ceiling. Excess emissions were allowed to be reduced through the purchase of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs).  The amended Act, called the Safeguard Mechanism (crediting) /Amendment Act 2023 was passed on 31 March 2023 [12].  Under the reformed scheme, the emission baselines are gradually reduced (by 4.9% annually) over time till they are on a path to the 43% reductions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050 trajectories.  A “hard cap” has been imposed on 116 of the emitters for the fraction of reductions that can be replaced by carbon credits. The reductions are monitored by the Clean Energy Regulator. Whether Australia is able to achieve its goal of 43% reductions by 2030 will depend critically on the efficacy of this reformed mechanism to reduce the baseline emissions from the power sector in keeping with the 2050 trajectory.  Preprints.org (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 February 2024                   doi:10.20944/preprints202402.1588.v1 4  3.4. The National EV Strategy [13],[5]  Australia’s current EV sales stands at 3.8% of the total annual vehicles sales. This is dismally low compared to the 9% of global sales, 15% for the UK and 17% for the EU. The National Electric Vehicle Strategy (NEVS) was just introduced on 18th April this year [13]. It aims to improve the EV uptake rate by increasing the supply of affordable EVs and establishing the required supporting systems and infrastructure for EV uptake and maintenance. This national EV strategy (NEVS) largely supplements and plays a supporting role to the state and territory EV strategies that have existed since well before the enactment of this national strategy. Note that hydrogen plays roles in both the Safeguard Mechanism (in Reversible Hydrogen Fuel Cells for energy storage) and the National EV Strategy (in the supply of fuel for fuel cell EVs (HFCEVs) for long distance commercial vehicle operations [4]. Prior to the announcement of the NEVS, it was not clear whether Australia could achieve the complete electrification of its transportation sector by the 2030 target. The NEVS has helped in allaying some of this uncertainty, but it is still not clear if it will be able to do enough 4. Hydrogen, Biomethane and Batteries 4.1. Hydrogen as a Net-Zero Fuel-Production, Distribution, and Use Most of the global production of hydrogen is from natural gas via the processes of steam-methane reforming and partial oxidation [14]. However, hydrogen produced in this way is not clean and must be coupled with carbon capture and storage (CSS) to reduce the associated emission. Hydrogen is classified into the categories of green, grey, blue, brown and black hydrogen, with associated emissions increasing from green (zero emissions) to black (the highest emissions) (Ref [1] Chapter 11). Green hydrogen is made through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources.  To utilize this new green fuel, methods must be developed to store, distribute and deliver it to the users. Many of these methods have been in use in the US for some time. Storage methods that have been investigated in the US include physical based methods (compressed gas, cold/cryo compressed, Liquid hydrogen) and materials-based methods (Adsorbent, interstitial hydride, chemical hydrogen – e.g., NH3BH3) [15].  Hydrogen can be delivered to the user in various forms and by different means: as gaseous hydrogen through gaseous compression, pipelines and tube trailers; as liquid hydrogen, as novel hydrogen carriers, and stored on-site and in bulk storage [16]. It can be distributed by road via pressurized tubes and cryogenic trucks/trailers, and by pipelines in several forms [17].  Rather than establishing new pipelines for hydrogen delivery, an easier option is blending with natural gas in established natural gas pipeline networks.  This method of delivery presents several issues, including potential embrittlement of pipeline steel and welds, the control of hydrogen leaks and permeation, and the need for a reliable hydrogen compression technology. These issues have been enumerated and reviewed by Singh [1] and Melaina et al. [18]. respectively.  The key findings by the latter are that: • hydrogen can be blended with natural gas in low concentrations (5-15%(v/v)) • maximum blends not requiring modifications for end users of piped hydrogen lies in the (5-20%) range • there are no major concerns for hydrogen-induced failures in steel and PVC pipes at normal pressures and stress levels in the natural gas distribution systems. 4.2. Biogas and Biomethane as Fuels for the Energy Transition Two well-known gaseous energy sources in mainstream energy application today are biogas and biomethane (also sometimes known as renewable natural gas – RNG).  Preprints.org (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 February 2024                   doi:10.20944/preprints202402.1588.v1 5  Biogas consists of a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, with biomethane comprising 40-75% of the mix. It is produced from agricultural, industry and municipal wastes through the process of anaerobic digestion and methane fermentation (Ref [1] Ch 4, 10). The current biogas production utilizes only 1.6 – 2.2% of its global production potential [19]. In 2018, 61.1% of the total biogas production was used for power generation or Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, 27.3% for heating and cooking, and 8.6% for upgrade to biomethane. Biomethane is produced from biogas via the processes of pressure swing adsorption (PSA), solvent scrubbing or water scrubbing of the carbon dioxide content.  How does hydrogen compare with other clean fuels? A case study is provided in Table I by comparing its performance with that of biomethane. Table 1. Comparison of Hydrogen and Biomethane as Fuels for the Implementation of the Energy Transition. Fuel Property  Hydrogen gas Biomethane gas Comment Calorific value         (MJ kg -1) 141 55 Hydrogen has a higher calorific value than methane. Density         (kg m-3) 0.09 0.716 But hydrogen has a much lower density – the need to compress hydrogen to obtain same energy yield. Production Electrolysis of water; steam-methane reforming + CCS Anaerobic digestion + CO2 removal Biomethane production technology is well-known and more mature than that of hydrogen. Transportation of fuel Hydrogen pipelines, pressurised gas tubes and cryogenic tankers by road. Pipeline or RNG tankers in liquid form. Hydrogen blends cam be transported using existing natural gas pipelines. Biomethane easily transported using natural gas infrastructure. Technology for use Hydrogen fuel cells for energy storage and EVs. Combustion engines, hydrogen fuel cells with external reformers. Hydrogen fuel cells and regenerative hydrogen fuel cells mature/developing tech for road transport and grid storage respectively. It is clear that while hydrogen is well suited as a clean fuel for the transition, biomethane is also able to provide most of the functionalities of hydrogen. It therefore provides an alternative fuel, particularly during the remaining lifetime of exisitng combution engine vehicles.  4.3. Hydrogen v Batteries Hydrogen and batteries provide alternative means of energy storage. How do they compare? As pointed out by Saul Griffith [20], hydrogen has a lower efficiency than batteries for energy storage and for powering EVs. However, a comparison of the roundtrip efficiencies of Reversible Hydrogen Fuel Cell (RHFC) (30%) and Li-ion battery (75-90%) shows that this disadvantage is offset by the similar return on investment (ROI) for the two technologies for storing overgeneration, in at least the case of wind energy [2]. As the roundtrip efficiencies of RHFCs improve through research and development, it is quite conceivable that these hydrogen-fueled energy sources will begin to compete favourably with Li-ion batteries in the foreseeable future.  One clear advantage of fuel cell-powered vehicles over BEVs is that the former do not need long recharging times, enabling long-distance vehicles to complete their routine operations with fewer Preprints.org (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 February 2024                   doi:10.20944/preprints202402.1588.v1 6  refueling stops. Table II compares the strengths and weaknesses of the two technologies for grid and transportation applications. Table 2. Hydrogen and Batteries: Strengths and Weaknesses. Property/Sector  Strengths and Weaknesses Energy Storage Rechargeable batteries (Li-ion) provide scalable technology. They have good storage capacity, cycle life and calendar life for both grid storage and transportation applications. Hydrogen fuel cells have better energy densities than batteries. Grid Application Large-scale (200MW/400MWh) batteries are now available. Reversible Hydrogen Fuel Cells (RHFCs) for grid storage are still under development. Transportation BEVs (Li-ion) are the norm in EV transportation. But charging times are long (Shortest charging times of ~ 20 mins). - Need to establish charging networks nationally Hydrogen Fuel Cell EVs (HFCEVs) are suitable for long distance commercial vehicles (refuelling times ~ 5 mins). Higher energy densities of hydrogen fuel cells allow longer driving range and heavier payloads than for BEVs. It is obvious that overall, hydrogen plays a complementary role to that of batteries in Australia’s strategy to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030. With further development in technology, it is quite possible that the advantage that batteries have over hydrogen fuel cells may reduce even further.  5. The Race to Net–Zero 5.1. The Need for Urgent Action Soon after the enactment of the Paris agreement, it became clear that global warming was not going to be contained within the required limits by the help of the existing NDCs at the time, and that more ambitious pledges had to be made by all Parties if the goals of the Paris Agreement were to be realised. The warnings emanated from several reports, two of which were the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 oC [21], and the Emissions Gap Report 2021 [22]. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5 oC was produced on 8 October 2018, and the key outcomes of the report has been summarised by the SDG Knowledge Hub [23]   as: ‘to be consistent with global emission pathways with no or limited overshoot of the 1.5°C goal, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions need to decline by about 45 percent from the 2010 level by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050.’  This report was received with much concern at COP24 (Katowice, Poland), and was one of the first indications that the existing NDC pledges by the Parties of the UNFCCC were insufficient in meeting the desired goals.   Each year since 2010, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) produces a Gap Report relating to global emissions. This report estimates the gap between the future GHG emissions if all countries implemented their mitigation pledges (via their NDCs) and what the pledges should be to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.  The 2021 report, titled Emissions Gap Report 2021. The heat is on: a world of climate promises not yet delivered, [22] was published on 26 October 2021. Its ten findings are a cause of both concern and alarm. They show that the NDC pledges of the Parties fall far short of achieving the near-term (2030) target, and if business was allowed to proceed as usual, it would lead to a temperature rise of as much as 2.7 °C by 2050. Evidence of the gap between the NDC pledges of the Parties and the actual emissions is abundantly clear when one considers the actual trend in global emissions over the last twelve years. This is shown in Figure 1. Preprints.org (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 February 2024                   doi:10.20944/preprints202402.1588.v1 7   Figure 1. Global emissions (Gigatonnes) for selected years [24]. Apart from the small dip in 2020, the trend in global emissions has generally been upwards over recent years. The small decline in 2020 was caused by the economic impacts of COVID19, and is an anomalous exception 5.2. Technology Readiness for the Energy Transition Will the EV strategies be able to meet the 2030 deadline? For emissions from transportation to meet the 2030 target, all states must meet their EV targets on or before 2030. An overview of the deadlines adopted by the states indicates that this may not be achieved. This creates the possibility of a technology gap, where combustion engine vehicles are phased out before electric vehicles are ready to replace them, leading to the non-achievement of the net-zero emissions by 2050 goal. As the Figure above indicates, emissions have not peaked yet (i.e. they are still rising), and we must wait for the peak before they begin declining towards net-zero.   Saul Griffith [20] demonstrates graphically (see his Figure 2.4) that the longer we wait for the peaking to occur, the sharper the required decline rate in the emissions will become for a 2050 target. This will inevitably lead to the need for drastic measures to achieve the required rates. The consequences can be dire. The emissions reductions will mostly likely occur through reduced use of fossil fuels, leading to an unprecedented fuel supply shortage. As economies depend on fuel supply as a vital resource, this is likely to result in a global economic crisis that is more severe than ever before.  Bioenergy-powered combustion engines can act as a stop-gap measure to fill the technology gap under such circumstances. Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) is a “drop in” replacement for Liquid Natural Gas (LNG), and second-generation biodiesel together with Hydro-treated Vegetable Oil (HVO) are clean replacements for petroleum diesel. These fuels will be able to act as alternatives for gas and liquid fuel-driven combustion engines till EVs become fully market-ready.  6. Conclusions Hydrogen has an important role in the implementation of Australia’s Net-Zero Strategy. This role has been actively promoted by Australia’s National Hydrogen Strategy, and through the recent $2 billion boost it received in the form of the Hydrogen Headstart Program. Hydrogen plays a complementary role to batteries in road transportation and provides a viable solution to the impact of the (relatively) long battery charging times issue on the operation of long-distance commercial service vehicles.  47484950515253545556Global Emissions (Gt)YearPreprints.org (www.preprints.org)  |  NOT PEER-REVIEWED  |  Posted: 28 February 2024                   doi:10.20944/preprints202402.1588.v1 8  Other bioenergy fuels such as biomethane, second generation bidiesel and HVO can also contribute strategically to the success of the energy transition.

This Budget invests $22.7 billion over the next 
decade to build a Future Made in Australia. This 
plan is about maximising the economic and 
industrial benefits of the move to net zero and 
securing Australia’s place in a changing global 
economic and strategic landscape. 

The global environment is changing rapidly. Supply 
chains are under pressure, with increasing 
fragmentation and intensifying global competition. 
New opportunities in clean energy industries are 
also emerging that will shape the future of the 
global economy over the next decade and beyond.  

Given our critical and abundant natural 
endowments and skilled workforce, Australia is 
well positioned to strengthen priority supply 
chains and become an indispensable part of the 
net zero global economy.  

The Government’s plan for a Future Made in 
Australia is central to this transformation. It is 
focused on encouraging and facilitating the private 
sector investment needed to make the most of 
this opportunity.  

The plan will help build a stronger, more 
diversified and more resilient economy powered 
by clean energy, in a way that creates secure, 
well-paid jobs and delivers benefits to 
communities across the country. 

The plan for a Future Made in Australia is about:  

•  Attracting and enabling investment  

•  Making Australia a renewable energy 

superpower 

•  Value adding to our resources and 
strengthening economic security 

•  Backing Australian ideas: innovation, 

digital, science 

• 

Investing in people and places 

As part of this plan, the Government will create 
a Future Made in Australia Act and establish a 
National Interest Framework to guide the 
identification of priority industries and prudent 
investments in the national interest. 

National Interest Framework  

The new National Interest Framework imposes 
rigour on Government’s decision making on 
significant public investments, particularly those 
used to incentivise private investment at scale. 

Through the Framework, priority industries will be 
identified under two streams. The ‘net zero 
transformation’ stream will identify industries that 
can make a significant contribution to achieving 
net zero, where Australia has grounds to build 
enduring comparative advantage. 

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
The ‘economic security and resilience’ stream will 
identify sectors that are critical to our resilience, 
are vulnerable to supply disruptions and that 
require support to unlock sufficient private 
investment. 

In the 2024–25 Budget, five industries are aligned 
with the National Interest Framework: 

•  Renewable hydrogen 

•  Critical minerals processing 

•  Green metals 

•  Low carbon liquid fuels 

•  Clean energy manufacturing, including battery 

and solar panel supply chains 

The Government will also apply community 
benefit principles to investments in priority 
industries, with a focus on investment in local 
communities, supply chains and skills, and 
promoting diverse workforces and secure jobs. 

This Budget invests significantly in these areas, 
through targeted support for early-stage 
innovation, financing, production and by 
improving investment enablers. 

In addition, Export Finance Australia’s National 
Interest Account will be expanded to allow 
support for projects where domestic capability is 
critical to protect our national security interests, 
strengthen resilience or ensure our nation is 
sufficiently resilient to shocks. Investments will be 
guided by the National Interest Framework. 

Given the pace of technological change, the 
Government will regularly review the list of 
priority industries against the National Interest 
Framework to ensure support remains fit for 
purpose in a changing world.  

Net zero transformation stream 

Renewable hydrogen 

Renewable hydrogen is a game changer, and the 
flagship of the net zero transformation stream. 
It opens the door to green metals, such as iron, 
steel, alumina and aluminium, and other 
applications critical to industrial decarbonisation. 

Our world class renewable energy resources make 
Australia well placed to produce green hydrogen 
at internationally competitive prices. Additionally, 
Australia is close to key markets, and our major 
trading partners have expressed a significant 
appetite for importing renewable hydrogen.  

Green Metals 

Significant quantities of green iron, steel, alumina 
and aluminium will be required to support the 
energy transition, globally and domestically. Both 
steel and aluminium are used in wind turbines, 
electric vehicles and grid infrastructure. However, 
traditional metals production is highly carbon 
intensive. Australia can develop a long-term 
comparative advantage in green metals by 
drawing on our abundant metal and renewable 
energy resources.  

Low carbon liquid fuels 

Sustainable aviation and diesel fuels will play a key 
role as the global and Australian economies 
transition to net zero, offering a decarbonisation 
pathway for many hard-to-abate sectors, including 
aviation, shipping and heavy transport. 

Australia’s large landmass, advanced farming 
practices, access to renewable feedstocks, 
established supply chains and renewable energy 
potential are all assets in developing domestic 
production of low carbon liquid fuels. 

Economic resilience and 
security stream  

Critical minerals  

Critical minerals are the building-blocks for a range 
of important sectors such as clean energy 
manufacturing, transport, agri-tech, medicine, 
defence, space, computing and 
telecommunications.  

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

2 

Under scenarios that achieve net zero emissions 
by 2050, global demand for critical minerals is 
expected to increase by around 350 per cent by 
2040. Australia is in a strong position to supply 
these minerals, with some of the world’s largest 
reserves of lithium, cobalt and rare earths. 

Refining and processing critical minerals here will 
allow us to move along global supply chains to 
capture more of the value and contribute to 
creating more diverse, resilient and sustainable 
global supply chains.  

Clean energy manufacturing 

Clean energy technologies are critical inputs to 
Australia’s energy transition. Global supply chains 
for certain clean energy technologies are highly 
concentrated, especially for solar panels and 
batteries. This increases Australia’s vulnerability to 
a disruption in supply, which could pose significant 
risks to Australia’s economic resilience.  

Along with other policy actions such as 
international partnerships and market facilitation, 
scaling-up Australia’s clean energy manufacturing 
will assist in strengthening our clean energy supply 
chains. 

Australia can contribute to the diversification of 
global solar and battery supply chains by 
harnessing our strengths in research and 
development, renewable energy and critical 
minerals, and investing in the areas of supply 
chains where we are most competitive.  

Strengthening our policy toolkit 

This Framework helps Government identify 
prudent investments in the national interest. 
It complements broader policy initiatives that 
boost productivity and economic growth. The 
Government will continue to apply other policy 
frameworks to promote Australia’s economic 
security and prosperity.  

For example, the Government will continue to 
invest in emerging critical technologies which 
create opportunities to transform a wide range of 
sectors across the economy. The Critical 
Technologies Statement prioritises action on 
artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, 
and quantum technologies among other fields.  

The Government will also continue to take direct 
action to build domestic industrial capacity for key 
defence technologies and capabilities, and support 
broader industrial priorities, including the priority 
areas of the National Reconstruction Fund. 

Attracting and enabling 
investment  

The Government is reforming investment settings, 
institutions and regulatory processes to attract 
and enable the investment Australia needs. 

New front door for investors  

The Government will establish a new front door 
for investors with major, transformational 
investment proposals related to the Government’s 
Future Made in Australia agenda to make it 
simpler to invest in Australia and attract more 
global and domestic capital. The front door will:  

•  provide a single point of contact for investors 

and companies with major investment 
proposals, 

•  deliver a joined-up approach to investment 

attraction and facilitation,  

• 

identify priority projects related to the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia 
agenda, 

•  support accelerated and coordinated approval 

decisions, and,  

•  connect investors with the Government’s 

specialist investment vehicles.  

The front door will complement and leverage 
existing institutions, including the Net Zero 
Economy Authority. The final approach to 
delivering an effective front door will be 
developed in consultation with investors, 

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

3 

businesses, governments, unions, communities, 
and other experts over the course of 2024.  

These initiatives complement the Government’s 
climate disclosure legislation and the forthcoming 
issuance of $7 billion in green bonds in 2023–24. 

Strengthening and streamlining approvals 

The Government is making it easier to invest in 
transformational projects by streamlining approval 
processes in ways that strengthen standards.  

The Government is providing $134.2 million to 
better prioritise approvals for renewable energy 
projects of national significance, and support 
faster decisions on environment, cultural heritage 
and planning approvals. This investment delivers 
more support for assessments across approval 
processes so we can reduce delays for projects 
and provide greater certainty for businesses.  

The Government is also committing $20.7 million 
to improve engagement with communities 
involved in the energy transition and accelerate 
the delivery of key energy projects, through a 
bolstered Australian Energy Infrastructure 
Commissioner and voluntary national developer 
standards. This will complement initiatives with 
states and territories to improve planning and 
energy grid connection approval processes. 

To further encourage investment, the Government 
will provide $15.7 million to deliver a stronger, 
more streamlined, and more transparent approach 
to foreign investment. This will ensure that 
Australia can attract the significant foreign capital 
flows we need, while protecting the national 
interest in an increasingly complex economic 
and geostrategic environment. 

Promoting sustainable finance 

The Government is committing $17.3 million to 
implement a comprehensive agenda to mobilise 
private investment in sustainable activities.  

The Budget provides funding to extend Australia’s 
sustainable finance taxonomy to the agriculture 
sector and develop an investment product 
labelling regime for financial products marketed as 
sustainable. Additionally, the Government will 
explore data quality improvements and provide 
$1.3 million to develop and release best practice 
guidance for disclosing net zero transition plans.  

Making Australia a renewable 
energy superpower 

Australia’s ambition to become a renewable 
energy superpower is foundational to the 
Government’s broader plan for a future made in 
Australia. The Government is taking decisive steps 
to promote private investment in priority 
industries by supporting innovation, financing 
and production. 

Innovation 

The Government is investing $3.2 billion over the 
next decade through the Australian Renewable 
Energy Agency to support the commercialisation 
of technologies that are critical to the net zero 
transformation. The new $1.7 billion Future Made 
in Australia Innovation Fund will fund the 
deployment of innovative technologies and 
facilities linked directly to priority industries, 
including green metals and low carbon liquid fuels. 

Financing 

The Government will work with the 
Commonwealth’s specialist investment vehicles, 
including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
and the National Reconstruction Fund, to ensure 
coordinated investment on critical government 
priorities. Investments from these entities can help 
reduce barriers to investment by de-risking 
projects and reducing upfront capital costs.  

Production 

This Budget includes targeted production 
incentives to scale up priority industries: aligning 
incentives to invest with the national interest, 
targeting ‘green premiums’ that are not yet 
reflected in market prices, and investing efficiently 
in mitigating the risks of excess supply chain 
concentration.  

Support for production is being delivered over 
timeframes that promote accelerated investment 

  |  A Future Made in Australia 

4 

over the next decade, and in ways that are 
contingent on successful production. 

The Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive will 
provide a $2 incentive per kilogram of renewable 
hydrogen produced for up to ten years per project, 
between 2027–28 and 2039–40 for projects that 
reach final investment decisions by 2030. This will 
operate alongside the expanded Hydrogen 
Headstart program, which supports the early 
movers investing in the industry’s development in 
a way that complements the support provided 
through the tax system.  

Details of these programs are subject to 
consultation, alongside proposals to provide 
further incentives to support efficient production 
of green metals and low carbon liquid fuels. 

Guarantee of origin 

The Government is making it easier for businesses 
and trading partners to source low-emissions 
products by building better markets and product 
standards for green products.  

The Guarantee of Origin scheme will measure and 
certify the emissions intensity across the supply 
chain of key products. The Budget provides 
$32.2 million to fast-track the initial phase of this 
scheme, focused on renewable hydrogen, and 
support the expansion of the program to green 
meals and low carbon liquid fuels. 

Cheaper, cleaner energy  

Delivering on Australia’s potential to produce 
abundant renewable energy is essential to 
realising the industrial opportunities associated 
with cheaper, cleaner energy.  

The Government will unlock over $65 billion of 
renewable energy capacity through the Capacity 
Investment Scheme. This investment will translate 
Australia’s natural advantages into reality and 
transform the electricity grid for an economy 
powered by renewables.  

This Budget also helps Australians benefit from 
cheaper, cleaner energy sooner by committing 
$27.7 million to better integrate consumer energy 
resources, such as rooftop solar, household 
batteries and electric vehicles, into the grid.  

Securing the net zero transformation 

The Government is developing six sector plans 
covering electricity and energy, transport, 
industry, resources, agriculture and land, and the 
built environment. The sector plans will guide 
decarbonisation efforts and outline the role of 
each sector in supporting Australia’s transition 
to net zero. 

This Budget continues the Government’s 
investment in emissions abatement, including 
$63.8 million to reduce emissions in the 
agriculture and land sector. 

Value adding to resources and 
strengthening economic security 

The Budget boosts economic resilience and 
security including by shoring up and diversifying 
supply chains. It does this by value-adding to our 
resources, investing in critical minerals projects, 
supporting clean energy manufacturing and 
advancing trade initiatives.  

The Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive will 
provide a production incentive valued at 
10 per cent of relevant processing and refining 
costs for Australia’s 31 critical minerals. This 
incentive will be applicable for up to 10 years per 
project, for production between 2027–28 and 
2039–40 by projects that reach final investment 
decisions by 2030.  

The Government is also investing in priority critical 
minerals projects, including through the Critical 
Minerals Facility and the Northern Australia 
Infrastructure Facility. This will complement the 
Critical Minerals National Productivity Initiative 
which provides $10 million to work in partnership 
with states and territories to develop 
pre-feasibility studies of common-user 
infrastructure, which promotes a competitive 
and productive critical minerals sector. 

The Government is making targeted investments 
in clean energy technology manufacturing 
capabilities, focused on the aspects of highly 
concentrated critical energy supply chains that 
best align with Australia’s comparative advantages 
and capabilities. This includes the $1 billion Solar 

  |  A Future Made in Australia

the clean energy workforce through expanded 
access to the New Energy Apprenticeship Program 
and investments in VET clean energy courses. 

This Budget also expands support for women 
training in male-dominated industries through 
$55.6 million for the Building Women’s Careers 
program and $38.2 million to support diversity in 
science, technology, engineering, and maths. 

This is part of the Government’s targeted 
approach to meeting skills needed for a Future 
Made in Australia, including $68.4 million to 
attract and retain the skilled industrial workforce 
needed to support defence industrial priorities. 

Investing in places 

The Government is investing in the regions that 
have traditionally powered Australia to realise the 
benefits of the net zero transformation.  

This Budget provides $209.3 million to expand the 
Net Zero Economy Authority, and catalyse private 
and public investment, and support workers 
affected by the transition.  

It also invests $178.6 million in worker transition 
support, including the Energy Industry Jobs Plan 
and place-based Regional Workforce Transition 
Plans which will reflect the voices of communities, 
workers and employers.  

Sunshot and $523.2 million in support for the 
Battery Breakthrough Initiative. 

To support the delivery of the 82 per cent 
renewable energy target, the Government has 
formed the National Renewable Energy Supply 
Chain Action Plan with states and territories which 
will strengthen supply chains of key inputs 
required for clean energy. 

The Government is also progressing trade 
initiatives to address global market competition 
and support critical minerals trade enhancement.  

Backing Australian ideas – 
innovation, digital and science 

Modern science, innovation and investments in 
technology will be critical to maximising the 
opportunities of a changing global economic and 
strategic landscape, including the net zero 
transformation. 

Building on Australia’s existing strengths in 
research and applied technology, the Government 
is investing $466.4 million to build quantum 
computing capabilities, in partnership with the 
Queensland Government and PsiQuantum. 

The Government is also investing $566 million in 
open science by supporting Geoscience Australia 
to map Australia’s endowments of critical minerals 
and national groundwater systems. 

To grow our core science and innovation 
capability, the Government will undertake a 
strategic examination of Australia’s research and 
development (R&D) system. 

Investing in people and places 

Investing in people and places is central to the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia plan. This 
Budget makes important investments in skills, 
training and education and provides support for 
communities and regions that are most impacted 
by the net zero transformation.  

Investing in people 

The Government is investing $91.0 million over the 
next five years to accelerate the development of

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is set to establish its Solar Sunshot program thanks to a $1 billion funding

commitment.

The Federal Government announced the establishment of the program, designed to help unlock domestic solar photovoltaic (PV)

manufacturing across the entire supply chain and grow solar PV manufacturing in Australia, which outlines a pathway to the

commercialisation of local solar PV innovation.

The program will be delivered by ARENA, with development and design to be done in collaboration with the Department of Climate

Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW).

ARENA Chief Executive O cer, Darren Miller, said, “ARENA has been at the forefront of building Australia’s solar PV industry through

its support for research, innovation and large-scale deployment. This has helped solar to become our cheapest form of energy.

“We’re pleased to see the Federal Government recognise ARENA’s wealth of experience and close relationships with industry by

calling on us to deliver the Solar Sunshot program.

“To date, ARENA has invested more than $830 million towards 233 solar PV projects. We are ready to take on the next step

alongside others in the solar industry to create a domestic solar manufacturing industry,” Mr Miller said.

Solar Sunshot is intended to provide support across the solar PV supply chain, including the scaling up of module manufacturing

capabilities and exploration of other areas of the supply chain where grant funding can help kickstart the industry. This could include

polysilicon, ingots and wafers, cells, module assembly, and other parts of the solar supply chain, including solar glass, advanced



deployment technology, or other aspects identi ed through industry consultation.

ARENA funded the Australian Photovoltaic Institute’s (APVI) Silicon to Solar Report to investigate solar manufacturing capability and

potential in Australia. The report outlined a credible pathway for a domestic supply chain that could result in bene ts such as

securing access to solar PV components as Australia signi cantly scales up deployment of solar PV, creating local jobs, attracting

signi cant private investment and unlocking potential export opportunities.

ARENA and DCCEEW said they will publish a consultation paper outlining proposed speci cations for the program, including

objectives, funding mechanisms, timings, and draft eligibility and merit criteria.

“Australia has the opportunity to build high quality products across the solar PV supply chain. Although we have a very small

production capability today, we have the skills and the partnerships to establish a strong base that can be built on over the next

decade,” Mr Miller said.

“To unlock our renewable energy superpower vision, we need to be able to play a part in the whole supply chain, while also working

with international partners and leveraging learnings as we build our own capability to complement the global market.

“We’ll be consulting widely with industry and other stakeholders to hear their views and inform what will be a transformative scale up

of Australia’s solar PV manufacturing capacity.”

Following the consultation period, ARENA and DCCEEW will develop the  nal program design.

Industry comment

The Climate Council has welcomed the announcement and said that the initiative will cut climate pollution and create clean jobs for

generations of workers across regional Australia. 

Climate Council Head of Policy and Advocacy, Jennifer Rayner, said, “This is Australia’s time to shine. We’ve got some of the best

solar resources in the world and, as a nation, we love harnessing the power of the sun to electrify our lives. Already, more than three

million Australian households have put panels on their roofs to save money and reduce climate pollution. 

“Climate Council’s new Seize the Decade report highlights the importance of enabling millions more households to install solar. It’s

key to continuing the build out of our clean energy grid, cutting climate pollution and helping families take control of their energy

bills. This investment from the government is a welcome, practical step towards making that possible. 

“Manufacturing solar panels here at home will make this proven technology more accessible for all Australians, and create more

good, long-term jobs for our young people in regional energy hubs like the Hunter. This is what seizing the decade and securing a

safer, more prosperous future for our kids looks like,” Ms Rayner said.

Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said, “Today’s announcement by the Federal Government of the $1 billion Solar

Sunshot program to support the manufacturing of solar panels in Australia through production subsidies and grants is a major shot

in the arm that will underpin our future as a renewable energy superpower.


“Australia has led the rest of the world in the research, development and uptake of rooftop solar systems, but we have thus far
missed the opportunity to manufacture more of these components here at home. This is about to change.



“We are a country rich in renewable energy resources, such as land, coastline and sunshine that have yet to be harnessed to their full

potential.

“More than 3.7 million Australian homes have installed rooftop solar, with almost half a million new systems being installed every

year. This commitment will mean that more of these systems will contain products made right here in Australia.

“The missing piece of the puzzle here is establishing a strong sovereign manufacturing capability that captures this innovation and

expertise to meet more of the extraordinary demand, both here and overseas, for solar products.

“We look forward to working with the government on establishing a detailed design and timely implementation of this policy,” Mr

Thompson said.

Executive Summary 
The strong fundamentals that have underpinned Australia’s past economic success will continue 
to be fundamental to Australia’s competitiveness. However, the net zero transition and 
heightened geostrategic competition are transforming the global economy. These factors are 
changing the value of countries’ natural endowments, disrupting trade patterns, creating new 
markets, requiring heightened adaptability and rewarding innovation. 

Australia’s comparative advantages, capabilities and trade partnerships mean that these global 
shifts present profound opportunity for Australian workers and businesses. Our abundant 
natural assets and resource endowments create significant opportunities to foster new globally 
competitive industries that can boost our economic prosperity and resilience, while supporting 
decarbonisation. When combined with Australia’s strong trade partnerships, fair and 
competitive markets and commitment to open trade and international investment, this will help 
make Australia an indispensable part of global supply chains. 

The Future Made in Australia agenda takes steps to foster and encourage the significant private 
sector investment into priority industries necessary to harness these opportunities and ensure 
our future prosperity. In certain circumstances, targeted public investment can strengthen the 
alignment of economic incentives with Australia’s national interests and crowding-in private 
investment at scale to develop priority industries.  

In considering the prudent basis for public investment, the following factors have been 
considered: Australia’s grounds for lasting competitiveness, the role the industry will play in 
securing an orderly path to net zero and in building Australia’s economic resilience and security, 
whether the industry will build key capabilities, and whether the barriers to private investment 
can be resolved through public investment in a way that delivers compelling public value.  

These tests have informed the development of a National Interest Framework structured 
around two streams:  

•  The Net Zero Transformation Stream will include industries that will make a significant 

contribution to the net zero transition and are expected to have an enduring comparative 
advantage, and public investment is needed for the sector to make a significant contribution 
to emissions reduction at an efficient cost.  

•  The Economic Resilience and Security Stream will include industries where some level of 
domestic capability is necessary or efficient to deliver adequate economic resilience and 
security, and the private sector would not invest in this capability in the absence of public 
investment. 

The Government will also apply Community Benefit Principles in relation to investments in 
priority industries. These principles will have a focus on investment in local communities, supply 
chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and secure jobs. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  1 

 
 
This paper outlines the National Interest Framework that provides rigour to Government 
decisions on significant public investments in industry on the basis of the national interest, 
particularly when they are used to incentivise private investment at scale. In this way, this 
Framework complements existing Government investment processes and policy frameworks, 
adding rigour to relevant policy assessments without replacing complementary processes. 

To demonstrate its application, the paper also applies the Framework to the Government’s plan 
to make Australia a Renewable Energy Superpower, providing a point in time assessment of 
how renewable hydrogen, green metals, low-carbon liquid fuels, processing and refining of 
critical minerals and manufacturing of clean energy technologies align with the principles 
identified in this Framework. The findings of this assessment support the meaningful but 
targeted incentives for private investment included in the 2024–25 Budget Future Made in 
Australia package.  

The Future Made in Australia package also includes broader investments in the Government’s 
growth agenda, including critical technologies, defence priorities, skills in priority sectors, 
a competitive business environment and reforms to better attract and deploy investment. 
Treasury will be responsible for the operation of the Framework and further details will be 
made available and consulted on as part of the Future Made in Australia legislative package. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  2 

 
 
 
 
A Future Made in Australia 
The Government’s 2023 Intergenerational Report identified five domestic and global forces that 
will continue to shape the trajectory and composition of Australia’s economic growth over the 
next 40 years: population ageing; the rising demand for care and support services; technological 
and digital transformation; climate change and the net zero transformation; and geopolitical 
risk and fragmentation. The Government is acting across a range of fronts to respond to these 
forces and ensure our future prosperity, including through employment and industry policy. 

Investing in modernising and diversifying Australia’s industrial base is a core part of the 
Government’s plan to make Australians the beneficiaries of the changing global economic and 
strategic landscape. The 2023 Employment White Paper outlined how coordinated industry and 
regional policy, combined with a strong enabling environment, policy certainty and leadership, 
can deliver a dynamic and inclusive labour market. 

The Future Made in Australia package in the 2024–25 Budget delivers on this priority by 
attracting and enabling investment, making Australia a Renewable Energy Superpower, value 
adding to our resources and strengthening economic security, backing Australian ideas and 
investing in people and places. This includes targeted public investment to strengthen the 
alignment of economic incentives with Australia’s national interests and incentivise private 
investment at scale to develop priority industries.  

Achieving the global net zero transformation is a critical imperative. Policy decisions are needed 
to allow markets to internalise the negative externalities from emissions, drive efficient 
decarbonisation, spur long-term investment in clean, emissions-lowering technologies and 
industries, and seize the economic opportunities this transformation presents. This is a critical 
environmental challenge, but also provides a significant opportunity to attract private 
investment and ensure Australia becomes a more productive and competitive economy, by 
capitalising on our existing and emerging strengths and comparative advantages.  

Intensifying strategic competition and rising geopolitical risks, combined with recent events 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic and recent conflicts around the world, have heightened the 
focus on economic resilience and security in most nations. This has been met with a renewal 
of industrial policies in many major economies. As a medium-sized open economy, Australia’s 
economic prosperity is linked to the fortunes of the global economy, which is becoming 
increasingly fragmented. Strengthening critical global and domestic supply chains, including 
in some cases through a higher degree of domestic capability, will help to respond to these 
changes and improve our long-term economic security.  

In navigating these structural changes in the global economy, Australia will continue to benefit 
from the strong foundations and institutions that have supported the strength and resilience of 
our economy over recent decades. Since the mid-1980s, predictable macroeconomic policy and 
an ongoing focus on fiscal sustainability have supported strong and sustainable growth, with 
low inflation and low unemployment. Microeconomic reforms that have promoted healthy 
competition and a strong commitment to free trade have lowered costs for households and 
business, provided access to global goods and services, and driven productivity improvements.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  3 

 
 
Australia has clear advantages 
Australia is ideally placed to benefit from the global transitions underway, given our unique 
combination of strengths covering access to renewable energy sources, resources, research and 
development, human capital and strong international partnerships. 

Our abundant natural assets and resource endowments create significant opportunities to 
foster new globally competitive industries that can boost our economic prosperity 
while supporting both domestic and global decarbonisation. In particular, our vast renewable 
energy potential provides the basis for sustained comparative advantage in new 
clean-energy-intensive industries. 

Transforming Australia’s electricity grid to one powered by low-cost renewable energy is 
a pre-requisite for capitalising on Australia’s comparative advantage in producing cleaner, 
cheaper energy. The Government’s Capacity Investment Scheme is unlocking more than 
$65 billion of private investment in renewable energy generation and clean dispatchable 
capacity, helping to deliver the Government’s target of an 82 per cent renewable electricity grid 
by 2030. 

Australia is home to some of the world’s largest reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, 
cobalt and rare earths needed to diversify supply chains and support low emissions 
technologies. The global demand for critical minerals will need to increase by around 
350 per cent by 2040 as the world progresses towards its net zero commitments.i Australia is 
already the world’s largest producer of lithium and is well placed to meet future global demand, 
with exports projected to double over the next five years.ii   

Australia has the ability to leverage its track record as a trusted and reliable trade partner, with 
established links into key markets in North Asia, the United States and Europe, to be a reliable 
supplier into the growing markets of the future. Australia has been a strong advocate and 
champion of the multilateral trading system and a rules-based approach. We will continue to 
actively engage in the relevant international fora to uphold existing rules and develop new rules 
to address contemporary challenges.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  4 

 
 
 
 
Role for government 
The private sector is responding to these major structural changes and harnessing these 
new opportunities. In many instances, businesses and investors possess the skills, market 
information, risk-taking frameworks, agility and flexibility to make the necessary and 
appropriate long-term investments in new markets and technologies. However, there are also 
circumstances where economic incentives are not aligned with broader national interest 
objectives.  

Government plays an important role to create a positive investment and enabling environment 
in which businesses can take appropriate risks. This needs to be partnered with rigorous 
assessment of where there may be a case for public investment to incentivise private 
investment at scale in the national interest. 

Given the major forces shaping our external environment, more direct government 
interventions may be justified where particular market failures are present, such as:  

•  Where the negative externalities from more emissions-intensive production methods are not 

appropriately priced into global markets, so cleaner production methods that present 
cost effective abatement opportunities are not able to compete on a level playing field with 
existing industry. This ‘green premium’ will lead to an undersupply of products drawing on 
cleaner production methods. 

•  Where private firms fail to appropriately price in the required level of economic resilience 
and security in critical sectors and supply chains, resulting in unacceptable levels of risk to 
Australia’s national interest or broader economy.  

•  When technologies that are critical to the net zero transformation or broader national 

interest are nascent, and public investment in innovation can generate important learnings 
that help those that come later to produce at a lower cost. These learnings represent 
a positive externality that early movers cannot internalise in their decision making. Given the 
presence of positive externalities, without government support, there will be an 
underinvestment in cleaner production methods, which slows down the learning-by-doing 
process and prolongs the use of more emissions-intensive production processes.  

Deliberate and targeted policy actions to improve the investment climate and address market 
failures will help the private sector to navigate the risks and challenges posed by changes to the 
global landscape and build a stronger and more resilient Australian economy for the future.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  5 

 
 
 
 
A National Interest Framework  
The Government has committed to introduce a Future Made in Australia Act (the Act) that 
promotes and facilitates investment in the public interest. The Act will include a new National 
Interest Framework (the Framework) that clearly articulates how priority sectors will be 
identified. The Framework will be used to impose rigour on Government’s decision making on 
significant public investments, particularly those used to incentivise private investment at scale. 

In considering the prudent basis for public investment, the following factors have been 
considered: Australia’s grounds for lasting competitiveness, the role the industry will play in 
securing an orderly path to net zero, the role the industry will play in building Australia’s 
economic resilience and security, whether the industry will build key capabilities, and whether 
the barriers to private investment can be resolved through public investment in a way that 
delivers compelling public value.  

These five tests have informed the development of the Framework, which provides practical 
principles for identifying priority industries under two streams and guidance for assessing public 
support. Given that technology and global markets will continue to evolve rapidly, sectors 
prioritised under the Framework will be reviewed regularly.  

The Government will consult on the details of this Framework as part of the consultation on the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia legislative package. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  6 

 
 
 
 
The National Interest Framework 

Identifying priority industries in the national interest:  

There are two streams under which an industry may warrant Government intervention to 
attract private investment at scale.  

The Net Zero Transformation Stream will identify priority sectors where: 

•  Australian industry is expected to have a sustained comparative advantage in a net zero 

global economy; and   

•  Public investment is needed for the sector to make a significant contribution to 

emissions reduction at an efficient cost.  

An industry is more likely to qualify for support under this stream if the industry:  

• 

is energy-intensive and capable of substantially reducing its carbon emissions by taking 
advantage of our abundant renewable energy resources;   

•  has output that embodies low carbon emissions and can help contribute to 

decarbonisation in other areas of the economy;  

•  can leverage Australia’s highly skilled workforce, using technological improvements to 

reduce labour intensity;  
is able to achieve economies of scale in Australia; and 

• 
•  aligns with our international trading partners’ current or future needs and is 

complementary to actions taken by our strategic partners. 

The Economic Resilience and Security Stream will identify priority sectors where: 

•  some level of domestic capability is a necessary or efficient way to protect the 

economic resilience and security of Australia, and the private sector will not deliver the 
necessary investment in the absence of government support. 

Consideration under this stream will include factors such as:  

•  The global and domestic concentration of supply and supply chains;  
•  The vulnerability of supply to disruption; 
•  How critical the industry or product is to our security and resilience; and  
•  Whether the industry can prevent, absorb, adapt or transform processes to limit the 

consequences of a shock to our national interests.

The National Interest Framework (continued) 

Policy approach 

In certain circumstances, targeted public investment can strengthen the alignment of 
economic incentives with Australia’s national interests, and incentivise private investment 
at scale to develop priority industries. Common barriers to investment include:  

•  The failure of markets to price in externalities, such as emissions from production, and 

positive externalities from learnings generated by early movers; 

•  Non-financial barriers, such as uncertainty about approval processes, access to skilled 

labour and a lack of enabling regulation (i.e. certification and standards); and  

•  Financial barriers such as high up-front capital costs, requiring concessional financing, 

or the cost difference between a low emissions product and its incumbent 
emissions-intensive competitor, requiring temporary production support.  

Under both streams, the Framework recommends considering how industry-led solutions, 
trade partnerships, regulatory approaches, or supply agreements could be used to 
efficiently align these incentives. Government should consider whether the barriers to 
private investment can be resolved through public investment in a way that delivers 
compelling public value, relative to these complementary approaches.  

Public support should be designed in a way that complements Australia’s strategic 
partnerships and should be consistent with Australia’s obligations under its bilateral and 
multilateral trade agreements.  

Community benefit principles 

The Government will apply community benefit principles in relation to investments in 
priority industries. These principles will have a focus on building capability through 
investment in local communities, supply chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse 
workforces and secure jobs.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  8 

 
 
 
 
Net Zero Transformation Stream 
As outlined in the previous section, the Net Zero Transformation Stream of the National Interest 
Framework will be used to identify sectors assessed to have grounds for sustained comparative 
advantage in a net zero global economy, and public investment is needed for the sector to make 
a significant contribution to emissions reduction at an efficient cost. 

In a world of intensifying global competition for clean energy industries, Australia is expected to 
have several areas of comparative advantage. These include: 

•  An abundance of low-cost bulk renewable energy capacity;  

•  Access to, and abundance of, critical inputs and bulk raw materials; 

•  Existing strengths in research and development;  

•  Access to deep capital markets, low sovereign risk and a stable political environment; and  

•  Proximity to fast growing Indo-Pacific markets and a strong track record as a reliable and 

trusted exporter of energy and resources. 

Australia is more likely to be globally competitive without long-run support if the industry:  

• 

is energy-intensive and capable of substantially reducing its carbon emissions by taking 
advantage of our abundant renewable energy resources;   

•  has output that embodies low carbon emissions and can help contribute to decarbonisation 

in other areas of the economy;  

•  can leverage Australia’s highly skilled workforce, using technological improvements to 

reduce labour intensity;  

• 

is able to achieve economies of scale in Australia; and 

•  aligns with our international trading partners’ current or future needs and is complementary 

to actions taken by our strategic partners. 

Over time, the development of market mechanisms here and overseas are expected to increase 
demand for low- or zero-emissions goods and production methods, reducing barriers to 
investment in these sectors. Examples of where the Government has contributed to the 
development of market mechanisms in Australia include the Safeguard Mechanism, New 
Vehicle Efficiency Standards and the Guarantee of Origin scheme which accredits and certifies 
the emissions content of key industrial goods. The Government’s Sustainable Finance Strategy is 
also supporting the maturation of markets for sustainable products through improving disclosure 
of climate risks and opportunities, and enabling better labelling of sustainable finance products.

Energy Intensity: Australia’s Comparative Advantage 

Australia has a comparative advantage in the production of decarbonised energy intensive 
goods due to our abundant, low-cost renewable resources, particularly wind and solar. 
This is expected to support globally competitive renewable electricity prices as the world 
transitions to net zero. This reflects a range of factors including declining capital costs, 
ongoing technological improvement in solar and wind generation and storage, and 
abundant solar and wind resources that enable scale and better capacity utilisation.

Energy Intensity: Australia’s Comparative Advantage (continued) 

One example of where Australia is expected to have a comparative advantage because of 
our abundant sources of renewable energy and our endowments of raw materials is green 
iron for steel production. Steel production is currently responsible for around 10 per cent 
of global emissions because it uses coking coal for both the chemical reaction to strip 
oxygen from iron ore and to generate the heat needed to produce molten iron and turn 
iron into steel.iv  

Steel production can be decarbonised using zero-emission hydrogen for both the heat and 
the chemical reaction in the iron-making process, and renewable electricity to power 
steelmaking in an electric arc furnace. However, it can be challenging to transport 
hydrogen, making it more economic to produce green iron close to where hydrogen can 
be produced (further detail in Priority Sectors, Green Metals). 

The appropriate nature, scale and duration of support for emerging Net Zero Transformation 
Stream priority industries will depend on the maturity of the low- or zero-emissions technology 
available to the industry, the specific barriers to private sector investment and the expected 
contribution to domestic and global decarbonisation.  

For very nascent technology, research and development grants and support for demonstration 
or pilot projects may be the most appropriate way to support the sector, to help accelerate 
learning by doing and incentivise private companies to invest efficiently in innovation and 
diffusion activities that have significant public benefit.  

For more mature technologies, the barriers to private investment are more likely to include 
uncertainty around project approval processes and financial barriers, which may include: 

•  high upfront capital costs to install or retrofit zero emissions facilities, which are difficult to 

commit to given highly uncertain policy and technology pathways; and 

•  the cost differential between low-emissions products and incumbent emissions-intensive 

competitors (where markets are not pricing in the externalities from emissions). 

In these circumstances, capital grants and different forms of concessional finance may be 
appropriate to help overcome upfront capital cost barriers, while direct production support may 
be more appropriate to temporarily bridge the gap (or ‘green premium’) between low emissions 
products and incumbent competitors. These measures can help to de-risk priority projects and 
improve rates of return for investors, crowding in private investment.  

Policy support for industries identified under the Net Zero Transformation Stream should 
generally be time-limited, encourage early-movers and bridge the gap until an appropriate 
market signal is established or until the green premium in cleaner production costs shrinks. 
Over time, barriers to investment are likely to decline as certainty improves around global 
emissions reduction pathways and early-stage projects provide critical learnings for future 
investors. Providing temporary support will drive earlier decarbonisation activity within 
Australia while maintaining the international competitiveness of Australian companies.

Economic Resilience and Security Stream 
The Economic Resilience and Security Stream includes sectors where some level of domestic 
capability is necessary or efficient to deliver adequate economic resilience and security, and the 
private sector would not invest in this capability in the absence of public investment.  

To qualify under this stream, a shock or disruption to supply in the relevant sector would need 
to have unacceptably high impacts on safety, national security, economic stability or wellbeing 
in the absence of sufficient domestic capability and capacity. The importance of ensuring access 
to supply can also be considered for emerging sectors. To assess the materiality of these risks, 
consideration will be given to the following factors, among others:  

•  The global and domestic concentration of supply;  

•  The vulnerability of supply to disruption or other barriers to access; 

•  How critical the sector or product is to our security and resilience; and  

•  Whether the industry can prevent, absorb, adapt or transform processes to limit the 

consequences of a shock to our national interests.  

The Government regularly undertakes comprehensive scans of the economy to identify 
products and sectors that are both critical for economic resilience or security and face an 
elevated risk of disruption from international and domestic shocks. Some risk events, such as 
a disruption or shortage of non-critical goods or services, will have a relatively low impact, while 
other shocks may have an unacceptably high impact. Assessing the ability of the private sector 
to respond to potential supply disruptions requires data-led supply chain mapping and 
consultation across Government and with relevant industries to determine the capability of 
business to:  

•  Pre-emptively diversify its suppliers and develop stronger business-to-business links;  

•  Absorb or adapt to disruptions, such as through accessing alternative suppliers; and/or  

•  Transform production processes during disruptions. 

Where substantial risks to the national interest remain, a range of targeted responses – from 
‘light-touch no-regrets’ actions through to direct government intervention – can be considered 
to manage unacceptable residual risks at least cost. Industry-led solutions, hedging through 
financial market instruments, government-to-government supply agreements with strategic 
partners, or regulation, should be prioritised. Where these are not sufficient or appropriate to 
address risks to economic security and economic resilience, public investment should be 
considered if it can deliver compelling public value.

The enabling environment 
Building a stronger, more diversified and more resilient economy powered by clean energy will 
require Australia to attract significant private sector investment and establish an environment 
that supports new businesses to grow and new industries to develop lasting sources of 
competitiveness. The Government is focused on promoting a competitive and dynamic 
economy, supported by the National Competition Review, delivery of the Government’s 
five-pillar productivity agenda, and investment in a skilled and adaptable workforce, as outlined 
in the Employment White Paper policy roadmap. 

As part of the Future Made in Australia agenda, the Government is taking further steps to 
attract and facilitate investment, including establishing a new front door to facilitate private 
investment. This new front door will support investors with major transformational investment 
proposals by:  

•  providing a single point of contact for investors and companies with major investment 

proposals, 

•  delivering a joined-up approach to investment attraction and facilitation, 

• 

identifying priority projects related to the Government’s Future Made in Australia agenda, 

•  supporting strengthened and streamlined approvals decisions, and, 

•  connecting investors with the Government’s specialist investment vehicles. 

The Government is also streamlining approval processes in ways that strengthen standards. 
Through smarter use of data, better decision-making processes and appropriate resourcing, 
the Government is delivering faster pathways to better decisions on environmental, energy, 
planning, cultural heritage and foreign investment approvals. This will help to facilitate 
development of nationally significant projects in priority sectors, while also balancing protection 
of our environmental and cultural heritage.  

The Government is putting in place the financial system architecture necessary to ensure 
Australia can mobilise private capital towards the transition to net zero. Building on actions 
including mandating climate disclosure and issuing sovereign green bonds, the 2024–25 Budget 
funds the development of an investment product labelling regime, extension of the sustainable 
finance taxonomy to the agricultural sector and the development of best practice transition 
plan guidance for businesses. 

Continued collaboration across the Government’s special investment vehicles will crowd-in 
private investment in projects that are in the national interest, including through the 
National Reconstruction Fund. As part of the Future Made in Australia package, the 
Government will expand the scope of the National Interest Account to provide additional 
avenues for financing projects in the national interest, leveraging the investment expertise of 
Export Finance Australia. 

These initiatives complement foundational investments in Australia’s net zero transformation 
and strong trade partnerships in a changing international environment. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  13 

 
 
 
Other complementary frameworks 
The Government will continue to apply other industry policy and national resilience frameworks 
to complement the Framework and shape our future security and prosperity.  

For example, the Government will continue to invest in emerging critical technologies which 
will create opportunities to transform a wide range of sectors across the economy. In the 
Critical Technologies Statement, the Government has prioritised action on AI, robotics and 
automation and quantum technologies among other fields. The Government applies an 
integrated national interest model to evaluate economic security, national security and social 
cohesion implications and makes targeted interventions when required. This ensures that 
Australia’s development of, access to and choices in technologies are secure, reliable and cost 
effective. The Government’s recent investments in quantum computing are an example of this 
approach in action.  

The Government has chosen to invest directly to build domestic industrial capacity for key 
defence technologies and capabilities. Australia’s defence industry plays an integral part in the 
whole-of-nation preparedness uplift in response to the complex strategic circumstances we 
face. A capable, resilient, competitive and innovative sovereign defence industrial base is an 
important element, even though Australia’s defence industrial base will never be completely 
self-reliant. The recently announced 2024 National Defence Strategy outlines the Government’s 
approach to national defence, and the accompanying Integrated Investment Program sets out 
the specific capabilities the Government will invest in to give effect to the Strategy. The 
Sovereign Defence Industrial Priorities in the Defence Industry Development Strategy will also 
support industry’s ability to deliver Australian Defence Force priorities and contribute to 
broader industry and workforce resilience. 

The Government will also continue to provide programs and support to other sectors to achieve 
specific government priorities and objectives, such as through the Government’s National 
Reconstruction Fund or the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.  

Community Benefit Principles 
In addition to the Framework, the Future Made in Australia Act will outline Community Benefit 
Principles for decision makers to apply when designing policies or considering investment 
decisions that are designed to promote private investment at scale in industries aligned with the 
National Interest. These principles will have a focus on investment in local communities, supply 
chains and skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and secure jobs. They will be applied 
in ways that promote private investment that builds sustainable industries by broadening 
opportunity, investing in future workforce, and strengthening supporting supply chains, without 
limiting the competitiveness of emerging industries.  

The Government will consult on the details of these Principles as part of the consultation on the 
Government’s Future Made in Australia legislative package. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  14 

 
 
 
 
Priority sectors  
Initial work conducted across government as part of the Government’s plan to become 
a Renewable Energy Superpower identified a number of priority industries that align with the 
principles included in the National Interest Framework, under either the Net Zero 
Transformation or Economic Resilience and Security streams.  

These assessments illustrate how the National Interest Framework can inform consideration of 
where public investment may be required to strengthen the alignment of economic incentives 
with Australia’s national interests. In particular, they have contributed to Government 
consideration of whether public support is warranted to incentivise private investment at scale 
in these industries, and the most appropriate policy approaches to do so.  

Assessments have been made at a point in time and are subject to review as policy 
circumstances and market conditions evolve. Consistent with the purpose of the National 
Interest Framework, they are not intended to inform all government decisions or replace other 
policy frameworks. Treasury will consult on the details of this framework as part of the 
consultation on the Government’s Future Made in Australia legislative package.  

Net Zero Transformation Stream  

Renewable hydrogen 

There is a strong case for including renewable hydrogen as a priority industry under the 
Net Zero Transformation Stream. Most notably, it:  

• 

is highly energy intensive and can take advantage of our abundant renewable resources;  

•  can make a major contribution to decarbonisation in other areas of the economy; and  

• 

it aligns with our international trading partners current and future needs.  

Contribution to net zero 

Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in the net zero transformation as it can be produced in 
ways that have limited or no emissions and replace emissions-intensive fuels in other processes. 

Hydrogen is a flexible fuel, which is transportable and storable to varying degrees depending on 
the derivative. It can be used for high-temperature industrial processes and is a key feedstock 
for producing chemicals with diverse uses such as ammonia and methanol. When used as a fuel, 
the only by-product is water and there are no carbon emissions at that point.  

Renewable hydrogen is truly a zero or low-emissions fuel that can be produced at a commercial 
scale through electrolysis, which extracts hydrogen from water using electricity. If renewable 
electricity is used, this process produces no carbon emissions, and is known as either ‘green’ or 
‘renewable hydrogen’. Most hydrogen today is made using either gas (via steam methane 
reforming) or, less commonly, coal (via gasification). These processes are carbon intensive, but 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  15 

 
 
if the associated emissions are successfully captured and stored, this is called ‘blue’ or 
‘low-emissions hydrogen’, with more emissions than renewable hydrogen. 

Beyond decarbonising existing uses of hydrogen in the economy, such as in producing 
ammonia, renewable hydrogen is an enabler of green manufacturing, with the potential 
to underpin green commodity production in a range of sectors, particularly where 
electrification is not an option. This could include decarbonising fertilisers, opening up 
value-added export industries such as green iron, and as an input to emerging types of Low 
Carbon Liquid Fuel (LCLF).  

Key trading partners, such as Europe, India, Japan and the Republic of Korea see hydrogen as 
a critical part of their transition to net zero, making exports of Australian renewable hydrogen 
an important opportunity for facilitating global decarbonisation. The costs of transporting, 
converting and storing hydrogen and its derivatives are currently high relative to unabated fossil 
fuels. However, this is exacerbated by distance, which means that Australia may be 
a competitive source of supply for key trading partners such as Japan in the future (Chart 2). 
It is in Australia’s interests to position adaptively for a range of hydrogen-adjacent 
opportunities besides hydrogen export – for example, using hydrogen as a feedstock in 
clean-energy embodied goods, such as green iron, as a practical way to embed hydrogen in 
energy-intensive goods.

Comparative advantage 

Australia holds several key advantages that suggest that we will have a comparative advantage 
in producing renewable hydrogen. Principally, Australia has world class renewable energy 
resources at prices that should be internationally competitive (Chart 1). This provides Australian 
producers an advantage because energy costs make up more than half the cost of producing 
hydrogen using present-day electrolyser technology.  

There are costs involved in both storing and transporting hydrogen. While this presents 
challenges for exporting renewable hydrogen, using hydrogen where you make it avoids many 
of these costs. It may be more competitive to directly supply renewable hydrogen embodied 
products, like green metals and ammonia that other countries need but cannot produce as cost 
competitively as Australia. An adaptive National Hydrogen Strategy will allow Australia to 
position for a portfolio of opportunities depending on how markets and technologies develop. 

Our long history as a reliable and trusted energy exporter will be attractive for foreign 
investment and some of our closest trading partners have announced significant use and import 
targets for hydrogen, such as:  

• 

Japan is targeting using 3 million tonnes per year of hydrogen including 1 million tonnes of 
imports by 2030. 

•  Republic of Korea is targeting the use of 3.9 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2030, 

up from 220,000 tonnes in 2021. 

•  European Union is targeting the import of 10 million tonnes of hydrogen in 2030 

(plus 10 million tonnes of domestic production). 

Australia’s skilled workforce will also be advantageous to establish a domestic renewable 
hydrogen industry, but our clean energy workforce will need to be scaled up to meet the full 
potential of renewable hydrogen in Australia.  

Green Metals 

Australia has significant potential to become one of the lowest-cost producers of green metals. 
The industry:  

• 

Is highly energy intensive and can take advantage of our abundant renewable resources;  

•  Can make a major contribution to decarbonisation; 

•  Can achieve economies of scale in Australia; and  

•  Aligns with our international trading partners’ current and future needs.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  17 

 
 
 
 
Contribution to net zero 

Decarbonising metal production will play a critical role in the net zero transformation because 
metals are essential inputs into core infrastructure, current methods are emissions-intensive 
and the relative cost of abatement means green metals will make an important contribution to 
cost-efficient decarbonisation pathways.  

Significant quantities of iron, steel, alumina and aluminium will be required to support the 
energy transition, globally and domestically, because they are used in industries that support 
the net zero transformation including wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicles. They are 
also essential inputs to other sectors of the economy, including construction, manufacturing, 
infrastructure, energy and defence, that will need to decarbonise. According to Wood 
Mackenzie, global demand will increase by around 61 per cent for aluminiumvi, and 13 per cent 
for steelvii between 2023 and 2050 in a scenario that is consistent with a 1.5 degrees trajectory.  

Current production technologies are highly emissions intensive. Producing metals requires large 
amounts of energy, resulting in substantial carbon emissions if using traditional production 
methods. The global steel sector accounts for around 10 per cent of global carbon emissionsviii, 
and the aluminium and alumina industry accounts for around 3 per cent of global carbon 
emissions.ix As the world progressively targets net zero while prioritising least cost abatement, 
emissions from metals production will ultimately need to decline. 

Australia already has a significant metals industry, with the iron, steel, aluminium and alumina 
industries accounting for around 11 per cent of Australia’s emissions.x Reducing emissions from 
Australian metals production would make a key contribution to Australia’s net zero target and 
prevent ‘carbon leakage’, where emissions-intensive tradable activities shift production to 
regions with less ambitious emissions reduction targets. Australia’s metals producers are also 
large employers in regional areas. Supporting the decarbonisation of these industries will 
support the transition of these regions and the retention of highly skilled and specialised roles 
across the Australian economy. 

The private sector is already starting to invest in green metals technologies. Earlier this year 
Rio Tinto signed Australia’s largest renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) to date to 
supply its Boyne aluminium smelter.xi CSIRO, ARENA, universities, and the private sector have 
built extensive expertise in low-emission steel and aluminium technologies to guide future 
demonstrations and industry development. 

Green building standards are also creating demand for green metals, and around 85 per cent of 
Australian exports in 2020 went to countries that have net zero emissions pledges.xii 

However, markets that clearly differentiate low-emissions products are still nascent, demand 
for green metals at a price that incorporates the benefits of abatement is limited, and 
early-movers face significant capital risk and innovation costs. There is a role for government 
to improve certification and trade of low-emissions metals, promote demand at a price that 
accounts for the additional cost of efficient abatement, and to spread the costs and benefits of 
overcoming innovation challenges across the industry. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  18 

 
 
Comparative advantage 

Australia’s significant endowment of the ores used to forge metals underpins Australia’s current 
comparative advantage in metals production. Australia is the world’s largest producer of iron 
ore and second largest producer of bauxite – producing 39 per cent of global iron ore and 
26 per cent of global bauxite in 2023.xiii Supported by this foundational advantage, Australia’s 
green metals industry could operate at significant scale and leverage skilled workers and 
advanced technologies to deliver highly efficient operations.  

Australia has the potential to produce variable and firmed renewable energy at competitive 
prices (Chart 1). Combined with Australia’s natural advantages in the production of metallic 
ores, Australia’ comparative advantage is expected to strengthen as demand for metals shifts 
towards low-emissions products and favours countries with plentiful renewable energy. Some 
metal industries are also located in industrial precincts, some of which are proximate to 
renewable energy generation. Australia has potential to become one of the lowest cost places 
in the world to make green metals. In addition, Australia has an existing skilled workforce, 
strengths in research and development and proximity to fast growing Indo-Pacific markets.  

Low Carbon Liquid Fuels 

Australia is likely to have a comparative advantage in the production of some feedstocks used to 
produce LCLFs, or in the production of LCLFs, or both. The sector:  

• 

is energy-intensive and capable of substantially reducing its carbon emissions by taking 
advantage of our abundant renewable energy resources;   

•  has output that embodies low carbon emissions and can contribute to decarbonisation in 

other areas of the economy;  

• 

is able to achieve economies of scale in Australia; and 

•  aligns with our international trading partners’ current or future needs. 

Contribution to net zero 

LCLFs will play a key role as the global and Australian economies transition to net zero, offering 
viable decarbonisation pathways for many sectors. These fuels are expected to be utilised by 
hard to abate sectors where performance requirements are high and few alternative emissions 
abatement options are likely to become available, such as medium-long distance domestic 
aviation, heavy road vehicles, maritime and non-transport sectors. 

The Australian economy currently relies on liquid fuels for around half of its final energy 
demand. This is particularly the case for transport, which accounts for around 70 per cent of 
Australia’s consumption of refined liquid fuel products. Sectors of the economy reliant on liquid 
fossil fuels are starting to transition to lower carbon options to achieve emissions abatement 
targets, often through electrification. This is most apparent in passenger motor vehicles. 
However, other liquid fuel-dependent categories are less advanced and in some cases the 
decarbonisation pathway is not yet clear. These include medium-long distance domestic 
aviation, heavy road vehicles, maritime and non-transport sectors such as mining, agriculture 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  19 

 
 
and construction, which will represent close to 20 per cent of Australia’s emissions out to 
2030.xiv Current Government projections for these sectors suggest they will remain reliant on 
liquid fuels – particularly jet fuel and diesel (or their equivalents) – to 2050 (Chart 3).  

LCLFs provide an alternative option to start reducing emissions. LCLFs have low- to zero-net 
lifecycle emissions during their production and use, compared with the fuels they are displacing, 
and can currently be produced sustainably from waste materials and biomass. In the long term 
it may be possible to produce LCLFs by combining hydrogen from low- or zero-carbon 
feedstocks with captured carbon dioxide. LCLFs can be produced using a variety of technology 
pathways and feedstock inputs, each with different emissions abatement potential and cost. 
Depending on the fuel, some internal combustion engines in current use can tolerate 
100 per cent LCLFs as a full replacement for conventional fossil fuels, whereas others will 
require blending or gradual incorporation. 

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is approximately two to five times the cost of 
conventional jet fuel, but provides the cheapest available approach to abatement for the 
aviation industry.xv Renewable diesel is estimated to be more than twice as expensive as 
conventional diesel, though this estimate depends heavily on market movements and 
international supply. Technology costs for fuels with higher abatement are expected to 
decrease over time as production processes and scale improve. Early investments in this area 
can lay the foundations for a future LCLF industry.

Comparative advantage 

Australia’s landmass, temperate climates, advanced farming practices, access to renewable 
feedstocks, established supply chains and renewable energy potential are all assets in 
developing a range of feedstocks to support a domestic LCLF industry to operate at scale.xvi  

The CSIRO estimates Australia has enough biogenic feedstocks to produce 60 per cent of local 
SAF demand by 2025, growing to 90 per cent by 2050 as biogenic sources continue to grow and 
hydrogen production ramps up. This equates to $10 billion of fuel at production costs in 2025 
and $19 billion in 2050. Australia is already a competitive producer of feedstocks used for LCLFs, 
exporting 400 kt of tallow and approximately 3.4 Mt of canola seed to Europe in 2022. 
Competitiveness in this segment of the supply chain contributes to broader cost 
competitiveness as feedstock costs are a primary driver of the total costs of producing LCLFs.  

One of the principal challenges of achieving commerciality is aligning sufficient offtake 
agreements with feedstock providers with demand for sustainable fuels, at a scale that supports 
establishing a production facility. However, the Australian aviation industry is large enough to 
provide demand for commercial-scale refineries, provided there is broad adoption of SAF as 
part of the transition to net zero.  

The CSIRO analysis suggests Australia has significant potential to be a competitive producer of 
SAF over time if the industry scales up. CSIRO reports under a ‘high scenario’, that includes 
government policies to support a LCLF industry, that Australia could potentially produce 
9,794 million litres of SAF by 2050. This compares to 717 million litres for New Zealand, 
12,139 million litres for Indonesia, 5,803 million litres for Vietnam, and 4,221 million litres for 
Malaysia. There is currently less analysis about the prospects for other LCLF types, including 
renewable diesel. 

Government’s role in incentivising investment in net zero industries 

There is significant private sector interest in building new competitive, renewable hydrogen, 
green metals and LCLF industries in Australia. However, private investment has been limited by 
immature supply chains for key renewable inputs, innovation challenges, lack of differentiated 
product markets and the emerging nature of demand for green products.  

Immature supply chains for low-emissions energy and fuels 

In many cases, building new low-emissions industries at scale requires sustainable energy and 
fuels to be available at scale. Accelerating the delivery of low-cost, reliable renewable energy is 
foundational to realising Australia’s competitive advantages in energy-intensive, low-emissions 
industries. In this regard, there are also interdependencies between the sectors considered in 
this paper, with the availability of low-cost renewable hydrogen being a key enabler of 
commercial green metals operations.  

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  21 

 
 
Renewable hydrogen is currently substantially more expensive than unabated gas but is 
expected to become cost-competitive over time as the cost of producing hydrogen from 
renewable energy declines. Similarly, the majority of current green metals pathways require 
large quantities of cost competitive renewable hydrogen. Growing production and reducing the 
costs of renewable energy, renewable hydrogen and LCLFs will be key to enabling efficient 
investment in products that use these fuels and key inputs. 

Promoting innovation and technology diffusion 

Transforming industrial processes to be low in emissions will require significant innovation. For 
example, even if the required volumes were available, the current costs of processing iron ore 
and refining alumina using renewable hydrogen are far higher than what can be achieved using 
coal and gas. Cost reductions are expected as key technologies such as electrolysers improve, 
new industrial processes like low-emissions direct iron reduction are developed, and early 
movers improve the viability and efficiency of production at scale through learning-by-doing. 

Public investment should focus on establishing strong incentives for the private sector to invest 
in innovation activities that have broad public benefits, and supporting the diffusion of these 
technologies and capabilities. In many cases, effective innovation is linked to strong trade 
partnerships and international engagement, to ensure innovations developed overseas are 
efficiently transferred to Australian industries. The case for public investment in Australian 
innovation is particularly strong where innovation challenges and opportunities are 
Australia-specific – such as the case for research and development to support the prospects of 
processing ores more commonly available in Australia (such as haematite). 

Promoting efficient capital investment 

Developing large-scale net zero industries require substantial investment in infrastructure. 
This includes port infrastructure, electricity networks, water infrastructure, as well as broader 
transport and social infrastructure to support regional workforces. Many of these infrastructure 
requirements have common-use benefits so may require coordinated or public investment to 
justify efficient investment. In other instances, new net zero industries require bespoke 
commercial infrastructure. This includes dedicated pipelines to transport hydrogen and new 
commercial-scale green metals facilities.  

In some instances, these new capital needs are incremental and can be delivered within 
business-as-usual levels of capital expenditure. A recent report from the Australian Industry 
Energy Transitions Initiative found that around $625 billion of coordinated investment is 
required to decarbonise Australia’s industry and energy system, with around $400 billion of 
investment relating to capital that would have been replaced or upgraded over this period 
under business-as-usual conditions.xvii However, uncertainty around the timing and price of 
demand for green products can discourage early movers from making large capital investments. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  22 

 
 
Green premium and absence of strong markets 

The costs of net zero products are expected to decline over time as key inputs are produced 
more efficiently, innovation barriers are overcome and efficient infrastructure is established. 
However, some products that will play an essential role in delivering a low-cost net zero 
transformation are still expected to have higher production costs than high-emissions 
alternatives, as they include the cost of efficient abatement.  

As green markets mature, demand for green products is expected to grow and the ability for 
consumers to differentiate between products on the basis of their emissions intensity is 
expected to improve. Governments have an important role to play in developing these markets: 
creating demand for green products through standards and regulations, supporting the 
certification of products’ emissions intensity, promoting well-functioning markets that allow 
customers to preference green products, and promoting competitive trade that minimises 
carbon leakage and supports the achievement of global net zero emission commitments.  

However, during the period where these markets are maturing, the additional cost of 
low-emissions products that aligns with the emissions reduction benefits embedded in the 
product may not be sufficiently valued by the market. This can limit the efficient development 
of these technologies, with an absence of demand causing an absence of supply. In these 
instances, public investment that aligns with a cost-efficient ‘green premium’ may be justified. 

The role of government 

Government needs to take steps to help circumvent these barriers to enable these sectors to 
achieve their potential. 

From an enabling perspective, that means delivering renewable energy, supporting 
well-targeted innovation, and partnering with the private sector to deliver impactful 
infrastructure. It also means government should work to ensure regulatory and international 
trade settings work to build well-functioning markets and promote demand for products that 
deliver efficient abatement. Over time, this should establish efficient price signals. 

However, in the meantime, there may be cause for public support that aligns private price 
signals with broader public value, and helps sectors to bridge up-front capital cost hurdles. In 
some cases, this could include production support or contributions to the capital investments 
necessary to transition to green production processes.

Economic Resilience and Security Stream 

Critical Minerals Processing 

A stable and diversified supply of critical minerals is critical to the smooth operation of global 
and domestic supply chains, including to support the net zero transformation, defence 
industries and a range of other applications. However, currently:  

•  Global supply is highly concentrated and vulnerable to disruption;  

•  There is limited capacity for the industry to quickly adapt and respond to any shock; and  

•  The consequences of a serious supply disruption would be significant.  

Criticality to economic resilience and security 

Critical minerals are metallic or non-metallic elements that are essential inputs across a range of 
sectors that support the net zero transformation, economic resilience and security and defence, 
and underpin global supply chains that are vulnerable to disruptions.xviii The net zero 
transformation will increase the demand for critical minerals that are required for renewable 
energy technologies such as hydrogen electrolysers, batteries and solar panels (Chart 4).xix 
Under scenarios that achieve net zero emissions by 2050, global demand for critical minerals is 
expected to increase by around 350 per cent by 2040.xx  

Critical minerals are important to the economic resilience and security of countries because 
they enable a range of technologies required for the basic functioning of a modern society, 
including defence and communications technologies. The global race to secure supplies of 
critical minerals is accelerating rapidly.  

Critical mineral supply chains are also prone to disruption because mineral production and 
processing is heavily concentrated in particular locations, facilities or companies. Supply chains 
that are highly concentrated, are typically fragile, volatile and lack transparency. Under these 
conditions markets and their participants cannot adequately price and manage risks, making it 
hard for businesses to access commercial investment and compete on a level playing field.

Australia’s role in supply chain diversification  

Australia is well placed to help meet expected demand for critical minerals. The geographic and 
economic footprint of our critical minerals sector has grown, and we are becoming a globally 
significant producer of raw and processed critical minerals. Australia has some of the world’s 
largest reserves of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements (Table 1).xxi 
In addition to significant known reserves, Australia has potential for more undiscovered 
minerals, with around 80 per cent of the land mass largely under-explored.xxii 

Australia’s critical minerals and broader mining sector has long-standing expertise in extracting 
minerals and a track record as a stable, reliable and responsible exporter of resources to 
support the scale of investment required. Australia has a clear comparative advantage in the 
extraction and export of minerals and mining engineering and services, which has been 
developed through innovation, economies of scale and a skilled workforce. We also have 
long-standing relationships with key partners that has supported investment.

Global markets are increasingly placing emphasis on the provenance of minerals. Consumers 
and financiers want to have confidence that the minerals in their supply chains have been 
produced using high environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. Companies may 
need to increasingly engage with minerals provenance issues as policy settings evolve globally. 
This places Australia in a favourable position to capitalise on our high ESG standards, acting as 
a differentiating factor compared to some other countries.

Barriers to private investment and role for government 

Critical minerals producers face complex operational and market challenges. Projects often 
involve technical risks associated with complex mineralogy, the need for specialised processing, 
and the challenges of operating in remote areas and securing access to significant energy 
supply. These projects can also be difficult to finance and operate due to high capital 
requirements, opaque markets, volatile prices and a lack of recognition of ESG standards. 
Together, these factors can pose challenges for securing offtake, equity and debt finance.  

Well-designed government support can de-risk investment and crowd in private sector funding, 
including from international investors who value secure and reliable sources of supply. 
Common-use infrastructure can help first-movers achieve commerciality and help precincts 
achieve economies of scale. Tailored public financing arrangements can also help projects 
manage price risk over a long time period, and unlock further financing opportunities. 

Expanding a secure and sustainable supply of high quality refined critical minerals is also of 
geostrategic value to Australia and key trading partners. Private sector customers are not 
always well placed to manage the risk of supply chain disruption and may not account for the 
broader public costs of this risk. For this reason, strategic products such as critical minerals, with 
supply chains that are highly exposed to disruption and where there are few alternative sources 
of supply to support diversification, may require public support that accounts for the public 
value of prudent management of geostrategic risk and promotes private investment at scale. 

Clean energy manufacturing 

Clean energy products are critical for Australia’s transition to net zero and supporting energy 
security through that process. There may be a case for developing domestic capacity where:  

•  Global supply is highly concentrated and vulnerable to disruption;  

•  There is limited capacity for the industry to quickly adapt and respond to any shock; and  

•  The consequences of a serious supply disruption would be significant.  

Criticality to economic resilience and security  

Australia is undergoing a significant energy transition in response to the global decarbonisation 
imperative and the significant improvements in the economics of renewable generation. 
The success of this transition will be contingent on having a reliable supply of clean energy 
technologies to ensure Australia’s ongoing energy security, as a critical enabler of Australia’s 
economic prosperity and standard of living.  

The high concentration of supply chains of key clean energy technologies poses risks to energy 
security and economic resilience. More than 75 per cent of the supply of solar panel and battery 
technologies comes from one country (Chart 5). This creates exposure to trade disruptions, 
competition for scarce supply, and unexpected events such as natural disasters that could 
impact production in a particular location. Supply and demand imbalances across different 
clean energy technologies are already causing long delivery times for some critical components. 
For example, high voltage transmission cables are reported to have a seven year wait for supply, 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  27 

 
 
and hydrogen electrolysers are expected to require significant increased production beyond 
current capacity.

Strong trading partnerships will ensure Australia continues to benefit from low-cost 
technologies manufactured in countries with highly competitive manufacturing cost bases 
for reasons including economies of scale. For example, China’s global competitiveness in 
manufacturing and government investments over several decades has allowed it to develop 
significant scale and expertise in clean energy technology, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) 
supply chains. Access to these products reduces the cost of renewable energy production in 
Australia, strengthening Australia’s potential to become a renewable energy superpower.  

Australia’s role in supply chain diversification  

Globally, countries are responding to the extreme concentration of solar and battery supply 
chains by diversifying where clean energy technologies are manufactured. The United States’ 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  28 

 
 
 
 
Inflation Reduction Act provides significant tax incentives for clean energy technology 
manufacturing. Europe, Canada, France and India are implementing incentives likely to drive 
domestic manufacturing in areas such as solar PV and batteries. It is likely these subsidies will 
lead to lower geographic concentration for specific technology in the future, and Australian 
consumers will benefit from any improvement in supply chain diversity and competition, 
subsidised by international taxpayers. 

Accessing cheap clean energy technologies that are manufactured offshore supports Australia’s 
ambition to become a renewable energy superpower. Strong trade partnerships, such as those 
in place with jurisdictions such as the United States and India, can be used to diversify 
Australia’s supply and reduce supply chain risks.  

Australia is also making an important contribution to the development of clean energy 
technologies, leveraging our considerable capabilities in research, discovery and development. 
Developing and commercialising new technologies, especially those relevant to Australia’s 
unique conditions and comparative strengths, will continue to be an important area for private 
and public cooperation to reduce critical economic vulnerabilities, and an important 
contribution to Australia’s trade partnerships.  

Barriers to private investment and role for government 

The most significant barrier to private investment in clean energy manufacturing in Australia is 
the cost competitiveness of alternative manufacturing locations, and the fact that Australia has 
higher operating costs. The competitiveness of Australian producers is typically driven by their 
product differentiation and design innovations that attract a premium from particular market 
segments. 

Where some degree of domestic capability is assessed to be prudent, due to global 
concentration of supply and pronounced geostrategic risks, there may be a case for the 
Government to support the development of targeted domestic manufacturing capabilities.  

Where public investment is intended to reduce geostrategic risks, it should be done in a way 
that strengthens trading partnerships and encourages Australia’s integration into global supply 
chains. This should complement trade and resilience initiatives which improve Australia’s access 
to critical products in the circumstance of supply chain disruptions. 

Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework  |  29 

 
 
 
 
Conclusion 
The global environment is changing rapidly. The net zero transformation is a critical global 
challenge that requires clear market signals and consistent policy direction. At the same time, 
a more contested geostrategic environment and recent shocks have increased the value of 
resilient and diversified global supply chains.  

The strong fundamentals that have underpinned Australia’s past economic success will continue 
to serve us well in this changing world. Our natural advantages, most notably our abundant 
renewable energy resources and critical mineral deposits mean we are well placed to prosper in 
the years ahead and play a critical role in the net zero global economy.  

The private sector and government both have a critical role to play to seize these opportunities. 
The Future Made in Australia agenda takes steps to foster and encourage the significant private 
sector investment into priority industries necessary to harness the opportunities of this 
changing global environment.

These applicants are developing projects that involve deploying large-scale electrolysers of
at least 50 MW in size, making a signiﬁcant and faster impact on implementing a new
renewable hydrogen industry. The shortlisted applicants are developing projects in
Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and Western Australia.

Announced in the 2023-24 budget, the Hydrogen Headstart Program aims to catalyse

Australia’s hydrogen industry to take advantage of Australia’s unparalleled opportunity to be
a global hydrogen leader.

Under the Program, projects seeking to produce renewable hydrogen or derivatives, such as
renewable ammonia or methanol, at scale can apply for a production credit delivered over
ten years to bridge the commercial gap between the cost of producing renewable hydrogen

and the market price.

Hydrogen Headstart will boost conﬁdence in the emerging renewable hydrogen industry,
sending a strong signal that Australia is an attractive investment destination for renewable
hydrogen production and associated infrastructure for end use cases.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the strong interest in the program indicates that project
developers are gaining conﬁdence in Australia’s potential to host this important new industry.

“Hydrogen Headstart is a crucial step towards keeping Australia on the path to become a

global hydrogen leader, creating new export opportunities, while helping to decarbonise our

economy.”

“The applicants shortlisted for the next stage provide us with the best opportunity at fast

tracking our renewable hydrogen industry. It’s great to see the commitment from Australian

companies who are looking to invest in and utilise hydrogen in their own decarbonisation

eﬀorts,” said Mr Miller.

Hydrogen Headstart builds on ARENA’s success as a leader in renewable hydrogen, with the

Agency having already committed over $315 million to 48 renewable hydrogen projects

since 2017.

This funding is in addition to over half a billion dollars of Australian Government funding

administered by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water for

regional hydrogen hubs in places such as the Hunter, Gladstone and the Spencer Gulf.

ARENA has been instrumental in the early development of an Australian renewable hydrogen
industry. Support for renewable hydrogen spans early-stage research and development
projects through to ﬁrst-of-a-kind deployments including hydrogen refuelling and hydrogen
vehicles, hydrogen for producing renewable ammonia, hydrogen for use in alumina reﬁning

and remote power.

ARENA was impressed by the overall strength of applications to the Program and believes
this forms an encouraging base for the industry to grow from in the future.

“ARENA has long supported an Australian renewable hydrogen industry. Hydrogen
Headstart is the logical continuation of our work, providing further funding to support the

acceleration of renewable hydrogen,” Mr Miller said.

Minister for Climate Change and Energy, The Hon Chris Bowen MP said: “Renewable
hydrogen is crucial to reach net zero, while creating economic opportunities for regional
Australia.”

“We have the largest pipeline of renewable hydrogen projects in the world – Hydrogen
Headstart is about supporting these projects to become a reality, as Australia transforms into
a renewable energy superpower.”

Shortlisted applicants have until 27 June 2024 to submit their full application. The Australian
Government intends to announce funding recipients in late 2024.

Growing Australia's hydrogen industry

[]

Australia’s clean hydrogen opportunity

Australia has an ambition to be a global hydrogen leader. Alongside renewable electricity, hydrogen will play a significant role in decarbonising

our economy. It will support the export of hydrogen embodied locally manufactured products.

We can use hydrogen:

as a source of heat or chemical for producing green metals

as a fuel for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, buses, trucks, planes and shipping

as a source of energy storage and generation

as a chemical feedstock to make zero carbon chemicals, such as clean ammonia methanol, and low carbon liquid fuels

as a source of tradeable clean energy that other countries will need to decarbonise their own economies.

The global hydrogen market has been forecast to reach US$1.4 trillion in 2050. Australia has a range of comparative advantages in this market.

These include vast renewable energy resources, space and land. These advantages allow us to competitively manufacture clean hydrogen and its

derivative products for our own use, and to supply the world.

Australia has the largest pipeline of hydrogen projects of any country in the world. It has an estimated value over $225 billion. There are more

green hydrogen projects under development in Australia than in any other country.

Hydrogen is central to the Australian Government’s vision for a Future Made in Australia. There is an opportunity to grow the Australian

hydrogen industry sector. This will capture the significant economic, trade, export and investment opportunities that are becoming available.

National Hydrogen Strategy 2024

The Australian Government has released its 2024 National Hydrogen Strategy. The strategy provides the framework to position Australia as a

global hydrogen leader by 2030 with four overarching objectives and 34 specific actions.

The new 2024 National Hydrogen Strategy sets a growth trajectory through production and export targets with progress milestones. It identifies

the most prospective hydrogen use cases that will be the focus for ongoing government economic incentives and policy support.

The new 2024 National Hydrogen Strategy represents a comprehensive formal review  (https://consult.dcceew.gov.au/review-of-the-
national-hydrogen-strategy)  and update of the 2019 National Hydrogen Strategy

(/energy/publications/australias-national-hydrogen-strategy#2019-nhs). The new strategy focusses on accelerating clean hydrogen industry

growth. This will be achieved through increasing global cost competitiveness by supporting industry development at scale.

Find out more about the 2024 National Hydrogen Strategy (/energy/publications/australias-national-hydrogen-strategy).

[]

Improving cost competitiveness

Hydrogen is still an emerging industry. It will become more efficient as it learns from the first wave of hydrogen projects. The Australian

Government is delivering a range of policy initiatives that aim to support these early projects.

Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive

The government will establish a Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive  (https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/new-legislation/in-
detail/businesses/hydrogen-production-and-critical-minerals-tax-incentives) . This will encourage renewable hydrogen production for

eligible Australian resident corporations with a time-limited and uncapped refundable tax offset.

The incentive will provide a $2 incentive per kilogram of renewable hydrogen produced for up to 10 years, between 1 July 2027 and 30 June

2040.

Hydrogen Headstart Program

The $4 billion Hydrogen Headstart Program will support large-scale renewable hydrogen production projects. These large-scale projects will

accelerate scaling of Australia’s hydrogen industry. They will assist industry learning and experience by successfully delivering and operating

large scale clean hydrogen projects.

Find out more about the Hydrogen Headstart Program (/energy/hydrogen/hydrogen-headstart-program).

Building regional hydrogen hubs

The Australian Government has invested more than $500 million to support and co-fund common infrastructure investments and the formation

of hydrogen hubs in regional Australia. The hubs will co-host producers, users and potential exporters of hydrogen across industrial, transport,

export and energy markets.

Funding allocated under the Hubs Implementation scheme has been announced for the following areas:

enabling large scale projects to proceed

prove new commercial models

provide confidence to capital markets.

Concessional finance is provided through government special investment vehicles such as the National Reconstruction Fund
(https://www.nrf.gov.au/)  ($15 billion allocated) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation  (https://www.cefc.com.au/document?

 le=/media/bnqfczbg/cefc_invesmentinsights_hydrogenfund.pdf)  (CEFC).

The CEFC invests in hydrogen  (https://www.cefc.com.au/document? le=/media/bnqfczbg/cefc_invesmentinsights_hydrogenfund.pdf)

through its dedicated AUD$300 million Advancing Hydrogen Fund, as well as in hydrogen-related climate technology opportunities. Equity

and debt finance are used to support projects that align with the National Hydrogen Strategy. CEFC financing for hydrogen projects has totalled

more than AUD$40 million. This includes the CEFC investment of AUD$15 million in Hysata’s most recent Series B financing round

(https://www.cefc.com.au/media/media-release/cefc-backed-hysata-raises-us-111-million-in-series-b-round/) .

Grant funding

Under its own funding programs, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has committed over AUD$300 million to:

hydrogen R&D projects

feasibility studies

pilot and demonstration plants.

This includes grant funding allocated to 21 research and innovation projects as part of its 2024 Renewable Hydrogen Deployment Funding
Round  (https://arena.gov.au/news/funding-boost-for-hydrogen-and-low-emissions-iron-steel-research/) .

ARENA administered the Australian portion of the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (HyGATE) initiative.

Australia and Germany have respectively committed up to AUD$50 million and €50 million to establish HyGATE. In January 2023, ARENA
announced funding for four jointly funded projects under the HyGATE initiative  (https://arena.gov.au/news/recipients-announced-for-

australia-germany-hygate-initiative/) .

The Australian Government has announced the establishment of a AUD$1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund
(https://budget.gov.au/content/factsheets/download/factsheet-fmia.pdf) . This will fund the deployment of innovative technologies and

facilities linked directly to priority industries, including:

renewable hydrogen

hydrogen derivative industries (such as low carbon liquid fuels, low carbon metals such as green iron and green alumina).

The fund is to be administered by ARENA.

[]

Guarantee of Origin Scheme

We are working to design and develop an internationally consistent Guarantee of Origin scheme for Australia.

The scheme will issue digital certificates that allow producers, exporters and users to prove where a product was made, and the emissions

associated with its production and transport.

The scheme will commence with hydrogen and will then expand to include low carbon liquid fuels such as:

sustainable aviation fuel

green metals like steel and aluminium

biomethane and biogas.

Find out more about the Guarantee of Origin scheme (/energy/renewable/guarantee-of-origin-scheme).

Improving Australia's hydrogen regulation

Commonwealth, state and territory governments are working together to make regulations clearer for the hydrogen industry. The National

Hydrogen Regulatory Review will help grow the hydrogen industry by making regulations more consistent and easier to understand.

Governments have committed to delivering National Hydrogen Codes of Best Practice. These will address barriers to regulatory transparency

and efficient approval pathways for emerging hydrogen industry applications. They will also assist regulators and industry to understand and

manage regulatory frameworks for new hydrogen and ammonia projects. Thes codes will support:

safety

national consistency

transparent regulatory pathways

efficient regulatory approvals.

The National Hydrogen Regulatory Review, and the development of the National Hydrogen Codes of Best Practice, relies on broad stakeholder

engagement and consultation and ongoing co-design.  Previous and upcoming consultation and co-design workshop information is available at
Review of Hydrogen Regulation: Hydrogen Industry Consultation  (https://consult.dcceew.gov.au/review-of-hydrogen-regulation) .

We are engaged on wider processes relevant to regulatory frameworks for hydrogen, including relating to the use of hydrogen in the transport

sector and Australian and international standards development processes.

We have published the lists of legislation, and relevant regulators for 6 hypothetical hydrogen projects (/energy/hydrogen/regulatory-lists). It

is anticipated that states and territories will publish their own legislation lists.

Building international partnerships

We are setting the foundations for Australia to be a major hydrogen exporter. We are doing this by partnering with other countries:

to attract investment

build supply chains

advance research and development.

Annual State of Hydrogen

The Australian Government has committed to review progress and publish an annual State of Hydrogen report.

The most recent State of Hydrogen 2022 (/energy/publications/state-of-hydrogen-2022) report found Australia has the resources, technical

skills, and track record with international partners to seize the opportunity to become a global hydrogen powerhouse.

CEFC backs more clean energy with new
commitment to Golden Plains Wind Farm

19 June 2024

The CEFC has extended its focus on renewable energy with a further $127.5 million investment in

TagEnergy's Golden Plains Wind Farm  GPWF  to help fast track construction of Australia’s largest

wind farm.

The 1333 MW wind farm near Geelong is a key asset in Australia’s race to decarbonise the

electricity grid. When complete it will generate enough energy to power more than 750,000 homes

– the equivalent of every home in regional Victoria.

The CEFC commitment to Stage Two of GPWF takes its debt finance in the $4 billion mega project

to some $350 million, with the CEFC capital backing the delivery of a further 577 MW of clean

energy generation capacity to the grid. The CEFC previously invested $222.5 million in Stage One of

GPWF.

We are now in the critical decade to reduce emissions and Australia must
urgently develop the assets that will deliver more clean energy to the grid.
Golden Plains Wind Farm will play a significant role in helping Australia reach
net zero as well as replacing the energy supply that will be lost when Yallourn
coal fired power station retires in 2028.

Plains Wind Farm will play a significant role in helping Australia reach net zero as well as replacing

the energy supply that will be lost when Yallourn coal fired power station retires in 2028.

“The CEFC has now committed more than $3.6 billion to support the development of large scale

wind and solar assets since inception, building out almost 5.9 GW of new clean energy capacity,
helping deliver an energy system of the future for Australia’s 21st century, net zero economy.

“In a further demonstration of the success of our innovative ‘bridge to contract’ finance, CEFC

capital will enable construction to begin before Stage Two secures power purchase agreements,

ensuring faster deployment of clean, green power to Victorian consumers. This strategy helped fast

track construction of Stage One, which has subsequently contracted 60 per cent of its energy.”

TagEnergy Managing Partner – Australia, Andrew Riggs said: “We couldn’t be prouder to be working

closely with our valued partners and backers on delivering the next phase of the largest wind farm

in the Southern Hemisphere as we continue TagEnergy’s mission to speed the energy transition.

“We need to act urgently to reduce emissions. Golden Plains Stage Two will help do that by

contributing 577 MW to Australia’s renewable capacity while supporting the Australian Government

to achieve its renewable electricity targets and help the world reach net-zero carbon emissions

sooner.”

It comes as latest national data shows that investment in large-scale renewable generation

projects in Australia reached $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, representing total new
generation capacity of 895 MW1.

This is the second quarter in a row where investment figures have reached $1.1 billion but much

more work is needed, with around 6 GW of new large-scale generation required each year to reach

the targeted 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030 in the NEM.

GPWF Stage One is expected to produce energy at full scale in 2025. TagEnergy estimates that

Stage Two will employ 350 people during construction, and begin producing at full output capacity

in 2027.

In a landmark approach, TagEnergy will undertake extensive investigation of the carbon footprint at

the site and publish the embodied carbon calculations from the construction of Stage Two.

Community engagement measures at Stage One GPWF already include a TagEnergy community

fund that provides free green electricity to locals living within 3 kilometres of a turbine, and

engagement with First Nations peoples to develop Indigenous training scholarships. This program

will be extended as part of Stage Two, delivering additional money into the local community.

The CEFC investment is alongside Westpac, Denmark’s credit export agency EIFO, Mizuho Bank,

Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, Natixis and Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

CEFC Head of Wind Joe Harber said: “The CEFC has been working with the owners of Golden Plains

Wind Farm since 2019 to help bring a bankable financing solution to the market. We are pleased to

continue to support this industry leading transaction and build on the success of the multi-bank

merchant financing structure pioneered on Stage One.

“From Collector Wind Farm in NSW to Golden Plains Wind Farm Stage One and now Stage Two, our

third fully merchant wind farm financing demonstrates how critical CEFC capital is to the

renewable energy sector. Our support has helped crowd in commercial lenders and the Danish

credit export agency to accelerate the delivery of more clean energy to the grid.”

Danish wind farm manufacturer and supplier Vestas is delivering turbines on GPWF Stage One and

has been contracted to supply turbines on Stage Two. GPWF is its largest onshore wind farm under

construction in the world and once operational, will increase the amount of clean energy

generated by Vestas in Australia to more than 7 GW.

Senior Vice President, Country Head of Vestas Australia & New Zealand Danny Nielsen said:

“Through our best-in-class people, wind turbines and capabilities, Vestas is delighted to build and

service this landmark project. As the world’s largest provider of wind energy, we have always been

committed to Australia’s sustainable future and we thank our valuable partners for joining us in this

world-changing mission.”

This paper provides a critical evaluation of Australia’s new Renewable Energy Target (RET) program
with respect to its capacity to support wind power development. Four structural ﬂaws associated with
the RET which undermine its effectiveness as a catalyst for technological change in the electricity sector
are discussed: (i) the inclusion of waste coal mine gas (WCMG) as an eligible fuel source which acts as
an indirect coal industry subsidy, (ii) program duration which is too short and ill-structured, (iii) a
multiplier that is well-intended to support small-scale renewable technologies but which creates
‘‘phantom capacity’’, and (iv) the capped target of 45,000 GWh which will stymie long-term wind
power market investment. The paper concludes with recommendations which stress the importance of
passing effective Carbon Pollution Renewable Scheme (CPRS) legislation to offset the weaknesses
associated with the RET. If an effective CPRS cannot be implemented, the paper recommends that
amendments be made to the RET to (i) remove WCMG from the list of approved alternative energy
sources, and (ii) extend the RET targets to reach 120,000 GWh by 2030.

Introduction

December 3, 2007 was a watershed day for Australian politics;
a new government was sworn into power under the Labor Prime
Minister, Kevin Rudd. One of the regime’s ﬁrst acts was to ratify
the Kyoto Protocol, and in doing so, committed Australia to
meeting a greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement target amounting to
8% above 1990 levels for the period 2008–2012. Although
Australia will likely meet this liberal target for the ﬁrst Kyoto
Protocol emissions reduction period thanks to favourable changes
in land-use and forestry, any subsequent reductions will require
radical structural changes to how the nation uses energy, which
even the government realises is of a magnitude that few other
industrialised nations face (Government of Australia, 2009h).
Given that nearly 50% of the GHG emitted in Australia comes from
power generation (Government of Australia, 2008a), it should
come as no surprise that one of the ﬁrst policy initiatives directed
at mitigating GHG emissions was a fortiﬁed program to encourage
enhanced development of renewable energy capacity in the
electricity generation sector.

The ﬂagship program of these enhanced efforts is the Renew-
able Energy Target
(RET) which consolidates all state-level
Renewable Energy Target programs and legally requires
Australia’s electricity utilities to ensure that 45,000 GWh of

total electricity
electricity purchases (approximately 20% of
generated) will be from renewable energy technologies by 2020.
On the surface,
the new RET brings Australia’s renewable
energy development program in line with EU targets (Hindmarsh
and Matthews, 2008) and gives Australian renewable energy
development ﬁrms the requisite market window to establish
stronger market presence, thereby enhancing economies of scale
and the likelihood of
renewable-sourced
electricity.

reduced costs of

For wind power developers in particular, the RET potentially
represents an opportunity to establish a strategic beachhead in
Australia’s electricity sector by capturing the economies of scale
necessary to close the commercially corrosive cost gap that exists
between wind power and coal-ﬁred electricity. Actual cost
differentials are hard to pin down for electricity sources due to
technological, operational and regional factors which cause costs
to vary; and peer reviewed sources on this topic for Australia are
somewhat dated. However, as a general indicator of the current
cost disparity, data from the Australia Institute in 2006 estimated
that the cost range of coal-ﬁred power was A$31–40 per MWh
(megawatt hour) while the wind power cost range was A$60–80
per MWh (Macintosh and Downie, 2006). As of December 2009,
the cost of coal had increased by over 25% from December 2005
levels.1 Moreover, wind power generation costs, which improved

4–7 fold from 1981 to 2006 (Celik et al., 2007), are widely
expected to continue to improve (Wizelius, 2007; DONG Energy,
2008). Accordingly, it is possible to argue that the cost disparity
has narrowed in the three years since this report was released.
Moreover, a recent study by the Australian Academy of Techno-
logical Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) estimates economically
quantiﬁable externalities associated with coal range between
A$42 and A$52 per MWh while the cost of economically
quantiﬁable externalities associated with wind power amount
to only $1.5 per MWh (ATSE, 2009). Taking into account these
external cost disparities, the cost of wind power is actually much
closer to the cost of coal-ﬁred power than market prices indicate
and might in some cases be less expensive. As the RET commences
in 2010, wind power prospects are positive because wind power
has the advantage of being close to commercially competitive and
capable of immediate adoption (Kann, 2009).

Of other promising alternative energy technologies, engi-
neered geothermal, solar PV and solar thermal technologies hold
promise given Australia’s abundance of these resources; however,
these technologies are not yet commercially viable for wide-scale
application (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008). Geothermal hot
in terms of scale
rock technology possesses massive appeal
potential. Geoscience Australia contends that tapping just 1% of
the energy from hot rocks located within 5 km of the earth’s
surface would be enough to supply 26,000 times Australia’s
annual power consumption on a perpetual basis for 2.6 million
years (Clean Energy Council, 2009). However, it is still at an early
developmental stage with only one operational site as of 2009
(Government of Australia, 2009a). Overall, geothermal
is not
anticipated to contribute to Australia’s electricity supply until at
least 2015 and even then only at a marginal level due to cost
(Government of Australia, 2009b). Solar PV technology is still 3–4
times the cost of gas-ﬁred electricity (Gurney et al., 2007).
Consequently, despite signiﬁcant government support programs,
recent projections estimate solar PV growing at an annual rate of
only 15 MW (medium case) up to 2020 (CME, 2009). Utility scale
solar thermal technology is also at a developmental stage, albeit
closer to commercialization with a 10 MW demonstration plant
planned in Queensland for 2010 (Government of Australia,
2009a). As a stand-alone technology, large-scale solar thermal
remains an expensive proposition thereby limiting commercial
diffusion to subsidised programs such as the Solar Flagships
program which earmarks AU$1.6 billion over 6-years to support
construction and demonstration of
large-scale solar power
stations, with an ultimate target of 1000 MW (Government of
Australia, 2009c).

Other prominent alternative energy technologies face non-
commercial barriers that are equally as formidable. Waste to
energy biomass is currently cost effective but growth is limited by
the capacity of Australia’s sparse population to generate and more
effectively manage waste. Although on the surface, agricultural
biomass and combustible materials (i.e. wood and wood by-
products) appear promising thanks to surplus land to support
such initiatives, wide-scale adoption of these technologies is
impeded by environmental factors which include extreme water
impacts associated with wide-scale
shortages, environmental
harvesting of energy crops, seasonal harvests which produce a
feast–famine supply proﬁle and competing agricultural interests
(IEA, 2005; MacGill et al., 2006; Gerardi et al., 2007). Growth
potential for hydropower is limited by a dwindling number of
exploitable water sources and severe regulation of water utiliza-
tion (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008; Government of Australia,
2009b).

Meanwhile, research into carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS) technology to render fossil fuel technologies as alternative
‘‘clean’’ energy sources is still at the developmental stage (Gurney

et al., 2007). As of April 2009, no functional CCS and power plant
integration exists at an industrial scale anywhere in the world
(Government of Australia, 2009h). Furthermore, it was estimated
as recently as 2007 that utility-scale implementation of CCS
technology would increase generation costs by 38–44% for new
natural gas combined cycle plants and 44–65% for new pulverised
coal plants, thereby rendering both technologies competitively
uneconomical (Gurney et al., 2007).

Finally, despite indications of increasing pressure to revisit
existing nuclear policy, Australia is a nation in staunch opposition
to the development of nuclear power. Any policy changes in
support of nuclear power will likely face vociferous opposition.
Moreover, there is evidence that the cost of nuclear power in
Australia would exceed the cost of wind power and even if the
cost disparity were negligible, further evidence indicates that CO2
associated with the entire nuclear fuel cycle is comparative in
volume to emissions from gas-ﬁred power stations (Saddler et al.,
2007; Sovacool, 2008).

In summary, although all of the alternative energy technolo-
gies listed can and likely will have a role to play in Australia’s
transition away from carbon-intensive electricity generation,
wind power developers in Australia face an unprecedented
opportunity to snap up the majority of business generated by
the January 1, 2010 commencement of the RET, provided the RET
is structured in a way to support progressive wind power
development.

In order to effectively support progressive development of
wind power, two elements must be integrated into a policy
instrument. The ﬁrst element is that support policies must be
designed to simultaneously encourage utilities to make the
investments necessary to operationally support enhanced levels
of wind power. For example, in Japan, despite the existence of
government subsidies to encourage wind power development,
utilities purportedly place undue storage demands on wind
power developers due to concerns that the existing grid will be
destabilized due to the ﬂuctuating nature of wind power
(Englander, 2008). Although wind developers are keen to take
advantage of government inducements to sell wind power into
the existing system,
Japanese utilities are not making the
investments necessary to support a progressive presence of wind
power (Valentine, in press). The second element is that any
support policies must encourage wind power developers to
commit the investment necessary to render wind power com-
mercially competitive when the support policy is removed. For
example, in Taiwan, the feed-in tariffs provided to wind power
developers are viewed as insufﬁcient for encouraging in-land
wind farm development; and as a result, a situation is emerging
wherein wind power developers are exploiting only the most
ﬁnancially attractive sites in Taiwan before moving on to other
countries. Once all the ﬁnancially attractive sites have been
exploited, it is highly likely that wind power development in
Taiwan will stall (Valentine, 2010).

This study ﬁrst aims to evaluate Australia’s new RET on the
basis of these two elements in order to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
this new program to support progressive wind power develop-
ment. The analysis highlights a number of ﬂaws in the RET which
may signiﬁcantly undermine progressive development of wind
power; therefore, this paper also seeks to put forth recommenda-
tions on how to improve the RET.

The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a
proﬁle of
the Australian electricity industry and discusses
recent developments and trends in regard to wind power
development. Section 3 evaluates the new RET in the context of
supporting progressive wind power development. Section 4
provides some concluding thoughts on how to improve the
effectiveness of RET.

2. The Australian electricity industry and wind power
development

With the exception of the Northern Territory and Western
Australia, Australia boasts an integrated national energy market
(NEM) which was established in 1998 to enhance electricity grid
security and provide a more competitive market for the supply of
electricity (NEMMCO, 2005). The NEM which serves about 90% of
Australia’s population (MacGill et al., 2006) is a ‘‘compulsory gross
pool market’’ in which bids to sell electricity are collected en
masse and electricity dispatches are sequenced according to the
price (Owen, 2009). Australia is the only major economy to have
introduced and maintained this type of mandatory wholesale
electricity trading market (Chester, 2007).

Australia is blessed with massive stores of coal, laying claim to
24.1% of the world’s economic demonstrated reserves of brown
coal and 5.4% of the world’s economic demonstrated reserves of
black coal (ABARE, 2009). Consequently, it should come as no
surprise that coal plays a dominant role in the Australian
electricity generation industry. To get a feel for the signiﬁcance
in Australia’s electricity mix, Table 1 summarizes
of coal
In 2005–06,
electricity generation by fuel type in 2005–06.
brown and black coal accounted for 75.6% of Australia’s
electricity generation (ABARE, 2008).

One energy technology that is conspicuously absent from
Australia’s electricity generation mix is nuclear power. Although
national uranium reserves account for 40% of total economically
accessible uranium stocks (Wesley, 2007), Australia does not
produce any electricity through nuclear power. Although there is
considerable public opposition to the prospects of nuclear power
(Falk et al., 2006), there has been renewed political discussion
over nuclear power development as a possible solution to CO2
emission abatement (Schlapfer, 2009).

Table 1 also highlights how important it is for the Australian
government to facilitate a transition away from coal. Per capita
emissions of CO2 from fuel combustion in Australia are amongst
the highest in the world and 43% above the average for Inter-
national Energy Agency countries (IEA, 2005). Of the 576 Mt
(CO2 equivalent) of GHG that Australia emitted in 2006, 47% was
from electricity generation (Government of Australia, 2008a) and
the vast majority of that was from coal combustion (IEA, 2005).
Moreover, under ‘‘business as usual’’ practices, Australia’s green-
house gas emissions from electricity generation are expected to
increase by 37% between 2004 and 2050 (Gurney et al., 2007).
Clearly if the new Labor government is to achieve marked
progress in reducing domestic CO2 emissions, a radical realign-
ment of Australia’s electricity industry will be required. The
trouble is that the low price of coal in Australia along with the
apparent security that huge stores of this resource provides
portends a rocky road for a transition to renewable energy.

Wind energy, as the most commercially viable utility-scale
renewable technology, is expected to be the largest contributor to
Australia’s new RET targets (Government of Australia, 2009b).
Wind power is rapidly expanding in Australia thanks in large part
to former national and state-level
initiatives to encourage
enhanced uptake of renewable energy by Australia’s utilities.
According to the World Wind Energy Association, Australia
possessed 1494 MW of installed wind power capacity at the end
of 2008, which represents the 14th highest level of installed
capacity in the world. In 2008, Australia’s installed wind power
capacity grew by 83% which was the third-highest growth rate
in the world (WWEA, 2009). A study commissioned by the
Australian government in 2005 projected an increase in installed
wind power capacity in Australia of at least 7360 MW by 2029/30
(Akmal and Riwoe, 2005). This would represent a ﬁve-fold
increase over current levels. However, statistics pointing to the
success of wind power development in Australia can be mislead-
ing because when Australia’s total installed wind power capacity
is compared to the wind power potential which exists in the
country, it becomes evident that a signiﬁcant opportunity to abate
the national dependency on coal-ﬁred power generation is being
missed.

With the exception of Australia’s northern coast, coastal areas
throughout Australia boast average annual wind speeds in excess
of 8 m/s (at 10 m) and are considered to be excellent locations for
wind turbine placement (Coppin et al., 2003). Furthermore, there
are huge tracts of land in the southern portion of Western
Australia and throughout the states of Southern Australia and
Victoria with average annual wind speeds in excess of 7 m/s (at
10 m) which would constitute ‘‘good’’ wind conditions for wind
turbine sites (Coppin et al., 2003). Mark Diesendorf estimates that
long-term wind power potential in Australia may be as high as
20,000 MW (Diesendorf, 2003, 2007). Assuming a capacity factor
of 35%, harnessing this potential would generate 60,000 GWh of
electricity annually, which represents about 28% of Australia’s
projected supply of electricity in 2020.

Although the theoretical potential of wind power in Australia
is sufﬁcient to provide all of Australia’s current electricity
requirements, there are technical constraints that dampen the
prospects of a virtually carbon-free electricity system. The
stochastic nature of wind power makes it necessary at higher
levels of electricity grid integration for wind power to be
integrated with storage or back-up reserve in order to avoid
destabilizing electricity grid operational security (Ackerman,
2005). As Saddler and colleagues (2007) point out,
‘‘currently,
the limitation is not the wind resource, but rather the transmis-
sion infrastructure, which has evolved for large centralised power
stations’’. Nevertheless, the Australia Institute, drawing from
international experience with wind power
integration into
electricity grids, has estimated that spare capacity in Australia’s
existing electricity grid can accommodate up to 20% wind power
before the stochastic nature of wind power begins to pose a
technical threat to grid security (Macintosh and Downie, 2006).

It might be tempting for critics to argue that the Australia
Institute’s estimate may be overly optimistic given the dominant
role that coal plays in the national energy mix and the relatively
low levels of installed capacity in hydropower and gas-ﬁred
power plants which are essential technologies for responding
effectively to the type of load ﬂuctuations associated with wind
power. However, there is also a counter-argument to such
criticism that the addition of electricity storage technologies or
enhanced reserve peak-load generation capacity could enable the
integration of wind power levels that extend well-beyond the 20%
benchmark (Diesendorf, 2007). As a testament to the technolo-
gical feasibility of incorporating high levels of wind power with
enhanced back-up support, electricity grids in two towns in

Western Australia (Denham and Hopetoun)
incorporate as
much as 70% electricity from wind energy (supported by diesel
generation), with an average wind power contribution of approx-
imately 40%.

Enhancing reserve capacity comes at a cost. One study
estimates that the additional cost of backup generation (i.e. gas
ﬁred power plants) necessary to allow wind power to reach high
contribution levels (i.e. 40%) in Australia would increase the cost
of wind generated power by approximately 25% on top of existing
wind power generation costs (Diesendorf, 2003), constituting a
premium of only 1–2b per kilowatt hour. Aside from these
technical costs of supporting high levels of
installed wind
power capacity, there are grid connection costs that need to be
considered in order for Australia’s wind power potential to be
better exploited. In many cases, grid connections would need to
be extended into remote areas where the absence of competing
land uses enhances the commercial viability of wind farms. One
estimate of
the cost of new transmission and distribution
infrastructure is at least AU$50 per meter for laying the cabling
and AU$35 per meter for any necessary access roads (Wizelius,
2007). This can amount to a 10% or higher premium on wind
power project costs (Wizelius, 2007).

Although in aggregate the economic costs associated with
additional reserve capacity and grid connection signiﬁcantly
increase wind power generation costs at high levels of installed
capacity, there are also economic savings associated with CO2
reductions that offset these additional costs. Many of the external
costs referred to earlier (A$42–A$52 per MWh (ATSE, 2009))
represent real costs that the nation is currently incurring even if
the nation’s citizens have not yet been forced to pay for some of
the more insidious economic impacts that are ineluctably bound
to progressive global warming. Furthermore, the ATSE external
cost estimates fail to take into consideration environmental
impacts such as damage to ecological habitats that temperature
change will bring because the ATSE projection only considers
impacts that can be economically quantiﬁed.

Irrespective of the barriers to full exploitation of Australia’s
technical wind power potential, evidence presented to this point
in the paper suggests that achieving a target of 20% or greater
contribution from wind power is both technically feasible and less
economically damaging than critics contend. A study by the
Australia Institute estimates that adding approximately 5% of
wind power to the existing grid by 2010 would only cost
consumers AU$15–$25 per year extra (Macintosh and Downie,
2006). The study further points out that if the costs of pollution
fuel power generation were fully
associated with fossil
internalized, the additional costs (including generation cost
disparity) to the homeowner would be fully offset (Macintosh
and Downie, 2006). These conclusions are supported by the study
into the externalities associated with coal by Australian Academy
of Technological Sciences and Engineering, referred to earlier
(ATSE, 2009).

In terms of assessing the impact that a 20% or greater
electricity supply contribution from wind power would make to
CO2 abatement in Australia, the New South Wales government
estimates that each MWh of power produced by wind farms can
displace 0.929 tons of CO2 which would otherwise be generated
through coal-ﬁred generators (Macintosh and Downie, 2006).
Employing this metric, if wind were to supply the 45,000 GWh of
electricity which is projected to account for 20% of the electricity
supply in 2020, wind power would displace approximately 42
million tons of CO2, which represents a 16% reduction of 2006
national CO2 emissions attributed to electricity generation.

In symbiotic fashion,

three notable developments have
appeared in the policy sphere to indicate that a path is being
created for encouraging greater uptake of wind power in

Australia. First, over the past decade, Australia’s state-owned
electricity grids have been integrated to form a national grid (the
NEM). Now, all regions except for the state of Western Australia
and the Northern Territory have interconnected electricity grids
(Owen, 2009). For wind energy, grid inter-connectivity delivers a
number of notable beneﬁts. For example, an interconnected
electricity grid allows states to integrate higher levels of wind
power without the risk of stochastic ﬂows destabilizing the grid
(Ackerman, 2005). It also allows wind farms to be geographically
dispersed which further dampens the adverse effect of wind
intermittency (Coppin et al., 2003). Second, the market liberal-
ization initiatives that accompanied grid inter-connection have
signiﬁcantly improved the prospects for wind energy developers
to sell energy into the grid (Owen, 2009). Third, the RET artiﬁcially
enhances market prospects by mandating enhanced purchases of
electricity generated from renewable technologies. Given that a
bill for a new CO2 emission trading system – the CPRS (Carbon
Pollution Reduction scheme) – which the government sought to
implement in conjunction with the RET was defeated in Parlia-
ment, the RET is currently the centerpiece of the government
strategy to facilitate a transition to renewable energy. Accord-
ingly, assessing the pros and cons of this legislation warrants
further attention.

3. The efﬁcacy of the RET for supporting wind power
development

The Renewable Energy Target (RET) announced in August
2009 builds on the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET)
program of 2001 which aimed to encourage 9500 GWh of
electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2010
(Government of Australia, 2009e). This MRET target was pre-
maturely achieved in 2006 (Kann, 2009). As mentioned earlier,
the new RET aims to encourage 45,000 GWh of electricity
generation from renewable sources by 2020 and consolidates all
existing state and territory renewable energy schemes into a
single national scheme which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the planning
process for renewable energy developers (COAG, 2009). Moreover,
the 2009 amendment increases the penalty levied on electricity
retailers who fail to reach their 20% quota of renewable electricity
sales from A$40 to A$65 (Government of Australia, 2009f).
This penalty is not tax deductible (Gerardi et al., 2007); therefore,
the punitive value of this penalty to the ﬁrm is approximately
A$90 (Government of Australia, 2009g), which serves as a robust
incentive for electricity providers to meet their quotas. On the
surface, the RET appears to be a bold initiative that places
Australia’s climate change response efforts on equal footing as
that of the EU, both aiming to ensure that 20% of electricity
generated will be delivered via renewable energy technologies by
2020 (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008). However, there are four
speciﬁc features of the RET that indicate it may under-deliver
both in terms of meeting its intended goal of
facilitating
45,000 GWh of renewable energy generation and encouraging
enhanced commercial viability of wind power.

The ﬁrst feature of concern relates to the treatment of waste coal
mine gas. When the government was designing the RET program, it
did so under the assumption that the CPRS would also be legislated
and the RET would gradually be phased out. Under this assumption,
the government agreed to a political concession to allow waste coal
mine gas (WCMG) to be included in the RET as an ‘‘eligible energy
source’’ to differentiate it from the ‘‘renewable energy sources’’. The
concession allows WCMG-ﬁred power plants to apply to obtain
renewable energy credits (REC) for electricity generated using this
fuel source. The government capped the number of RECs available
to WCMG projects (at 425 GWh in 2011 and 850 GWh every year

from 2012–2020) and increased the aggregate RET by these
amounts to avoid eroding the market for RECs attached to
renewable energy projects (Government of Australia, 2009d).
Unfortunately, there is a ﬂaw with this treatment of WCMG in
the absence of a CPRS. WCMG is a by-product of the coal mining
process. Accordingly, any wholesale price of captured WCMG that
is above the marginal cost of capture represents additional proﬁts
to coal mining ﬁrms. If WCMG were not included in the RET
mandatory purchase program, it is unlikely that there would be
much proﬁt in capture for sale of WCMG because the cost of capture
makes the technology commercially unattractive. However, in the
presence of a mandatory purchase program, WCMG can be
captured and sold at a proﬁt. In short, the policy as it now stands
is a form of subsidy to coal mining ﬁrms which if passed on through
the coal value chain will reduce the cost of coal and widen the
gap between the costs of coal-ﬁred power and wind power.
Any progress made during the course of the RET in closing the
economic divide between the costs of coal-ﬁred power and wind
power will potentially be usurped by proﬁts accruing to the coal
mining industry as a result of WCMG capture for sale. It also
incentivizes the commercialization of a technology that is far
from a clean energy source because methane combusted for
electricity generation produces CO2 emissions. This subsidy to
WCMG power facilities along with a proposed AU$270 million ‘‘Coal
Sector Adjustment Fund’’ which the government proposes
establishing within the Climate Change Action Fund to provide
funding for coal sector abatement projects and capital grants
(Government of Australia, 2009c), represents a level of ﬁnancial
assistance to a dirty energy source that should be taxed rather than
subsidised.

A second feature of concern related to the RET involves the
duration of the program. As it stands now, the program is
designed to expire in 2030 with annual targets ﬁxed in the
manner outlined in Table 2 (Government of Australia, 2009f). The
renewable energy targets increase steadily over the ﬁrst decade to
reﬂect a cumulative increase in installed capacity. To illustrate,
the annual target of 14,400 GWh in 2011 conceptually consists
of 12,500 GWh of pre-existing renewable energy generation
and 1900 GWh of new generation to be added in 2011. Accom-
modation is made for adding annual capacity up to 2020 when the
annual target of 45,000 GWh of total generation is slated to be
met. No additional capacity has been targeted beyond 2020
because the CPRS was expected to be enacted at the same time as
the RET and it was felt that emissions trading under the CPRS
would become robust enough to level the technological playing
ﬁeld and render the RET moot (COAG, 2008; Government of
Australia, 2008b). Unfortunately the CPRS Bill was defeated in
Parliament and this has signiﬁcantly weakened the efﬁcacy of the
RET as originally planned. As it now stands, in the ﬁnal 10 years
of the RET program, there will be diminished incentive for
electricity retailers to add additional renewable energy capacity
beyond that which was established in the ﬁrst ten-year period.
Barring any amendments to this target post-2020 or the imple-
mentation of other CO2 emission reduction policies, one can
expect a signiﬁcant drop-off in renewable energy growth once the
target of 45,000 GWh of generation is reached (cf. IEA, 2005).
An additional complication arising from the manner in which the
targets have been laid out over the 20-year period is that there

likely be heavy competition amongst renewable energy
will
developers in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of
the scheme because
establishing renewable technology capacity in the early years of
the program ensures that renewable energy developers will be
able to compete for 15–20 years of guaranteed purchases.
Long-term revenue earning capability is essential to renewable
energy developers who typically extend debt ﬁnancing and
amortize investments over 15-year periods (Gerardi et al., 2007;
Wizelius, 2007). Conversely,
renewable energy developers
bidding for the 4600 GWh of new electricity supply between
2019–2020 will only have 10 years of certain business prospects
before the program expires. Consequently, assuming there is no
emergent supplemental policy to regulate GHG emissions, one
can anticipate reduced competition for renewable energy sales in
the latter part of the program and; therefore, comparatively
higher renewable sales prices. In short, the current structure of
the RET works counter to the goal of encouraging an acceleration
of renewable energy demand to support the economies of scale
to facilitate further reductions in renewable energy prices.
It supports the process half way and then allows the market to
drop out.

A third feature of concern relates to a multiplier scheme
established to support small electricity generators. Essentially
under this mechanism, renewable electricity credits produced by
small-scale (rated output under 1500 KW) solar PV, solar thermal
(water), wind and hydro electricity systems will be multiplied by
a pre-established ’’multiplier’’ for electricity output as outlined in
Table 3 (Government of Australia, 2009f). Under this system,
10 MWh of electricity generated by an approved small-scale
technology will receive REC credit for 50 MWh of generation,
thereby reducing the RET pool by that inﬂated amount. In short,
the program creates phantom credits that exaggerate the real
amount of renewable electricity generated. Moreover, although
this will catalyze robust sales in early years for solar thermal
heaters and household-scale electricity generators, the added
competition from small generators might be signiﬁcant enough to
impair the development of utility-scale renewable electricity
projects during the 2010–2015 period, which is speciﬁcally when
wind power and other larger utility-scale developments need to
be initialized in order to provide 10–15-years of revenue to allow
developers to proﬁtably amortize investments.

Finally, as a fourth feature of concern, the strategic decision to
design a capped target system for renewable energy as opposed
to offering renewable energy developers a feed-in subsidy or
production tax credit
for unlimited amounts of electricity
generated is arguably a questionable strategy if the goal is to
nurture the emergence of a commercially viable domestic
renewable energy industry. For wind power developers to be
successful in any given market over a sustained period, two things
must exist. First, the wind power developers must be able to make

a proﬁt in order to support the type of investment (i.e. capital
investment, R&D initiatives, capacity expansion, etc.) that is
essential for reducing future costs and enhancing the long-term
commercial viability of wind power. Second, revenue ﬂows need
to be cumulative, the current year’s revenues building on past
years. This provides wind power developers with increasing
economies of scale which further help reduce costs and further
enhance the long-term commercial viability of wind power.
Under a capped target system, especially one with relatively mild
targets at the front-end such as that exhibited by the RET, neither
of these two criteria are likely to be met. First, wind power
developers will see proﬁts squeezed by heated competition in the
thermal water heaters
early years (with small-scale solar
complicating the competitive mix); and therefore, wind devel-
opers will have diminished capacity to ﬁnance capital expendi-
tures and other investments to stimulate cost reduction. Second,
the capped target system disrupts revenue ﬂow predictability and
undermines strategic planning. Under the RET, unless there is a
drastic change in market economies or additional policies to
support a transition to renewable energy, it is likely that market
demand for new renewable energy capacity will diminish in 2020.
This means that established wind power ﬁrms that have gained
momentum over 10 years of progressive revenue increases will
suddenly ﬁnd themselves mired in a contracting market with the
bulk of revenue being provided by an asset base is gradually aging
toward obsolescence.

4.

Improving the RET

Methods for improving the RET will differ depending on
whether or not an effective emission trading scheme (ETS) is
eventually enacted.

The four weaknesses of the current RET which were outlined
earlier could be offset by the beneﬁts a robust cap and trade
regime can provide. First, the ﬁnancial beneﬁts to the coal
industry that the waste coal mine gas (WCMG) subsidy provides
would be signiﬁcantly minimised if the WCMG project developers
had to purchase CO2 emission permits and still generate WCMG-
ﬁred power at competitive rates. Second, an ETS that effectively
taxes CO2 emissions would level the competitive playing ﬁeld
between coal-ﬁred power and wind power and enhance long-
term revenue prospects for wind power that extend beyond the
duration of
the small generator multiplier
intended to give a boost to small-scale technologies would be
less of a threat to wind power market development because the
business lost to small-scale generators in early years would be
compensated for through business taken away from carbon-
intensive power plants in ensuing years (once the multiplier
program expires) as the electricity industry evolves in response to
the positive market signals that an ETS would convey. Finally, the
cap of 45,000 GWh would no longer be an issue of concern
regarding progressive wind power market growth because once
the ETS begins to reﬂect international values for CO2 emissions
credits (as the Australian CPRS was intended to achieve), wind

Proposed renewable energy capacity targets post-2020.

power would become cost competitive and render the RET cap
moot. In summary, under a scenario which includes enactment of
an effective ETS, the RET as it now stands is sufﬁcient for
supporting wind power development.

Obviously, this presupposes that any ETS (such as the CPRS)
would set annual emission ceilings at a level that would signiﬁcantly
alter the comparative costs of electricity sources. A weak cap and
trade system would do little to level the competitive playing ﬁeld in
the manner necessary to provide wind developers with long-term
market growth prospects. Indications are that the proposed CPRS is
designed to be an aggressive program under which annual permits
would be restricted over time to achieve the national 60% GHG
reduction target (based on 2000 levels) by 2050 (Government of
Australia, 2008b). This implies a robust program where the value of
carbon credits would substantially increase the overall cost of fossil
fuel-based electricity and signiﬁcantly alter market dynamics.

In a ‘‘business as usual’’ scenario where an effective ETS is not
enacted, the RET is not currently sufﬁcient to improve commercial
viability of wind power. As such, all four of the weaknesses
identiﬁed earlier need to be amended.

First, if the goal is to wean the nation off a dependence on
coal-ﬁred electricity, the WCMG should not be eligible for RECs.
Any part of the coal value chain that is subsidised in this way
strengthens the economic case for continued reliance on coal-
ﬁred power and makes it harder for utility-scale alternative
electricity sources (such as wind power) to compete on a level
basis. Already, alternative energy technologies face an uphill
battle when competing against coal-ﬁred electricity providers due
to disproportional government support. For example, the coal
sector beneﬁts from two programs – COAL21 which is a 10-year,
AU$1 billion public–private partnership program to ﬁnance
research into reducing emissions from coal (Government of
Australia, 2009g) and the CCS Flagship program which is a
9-year AU$2.4 billion program to support carbon capture and
sequestration research (Government of Australia, 2009c) – while
the main renewable energy support program under the Clean
Energy Initiative provides just AU$465 million to be shared across
numerous renewable energy technology platforms. Although
other renewable energy support initiatives exist, they pale in
comparison to the R&D expenditures in the coal industry. If the
release of methane from coal mines is a concern, ﬂaring or capture
for energy use should be regulated, not subsidised.

Second, the government should consider formally extending
the RET program to facilitate a measured expansion of installed
renewable energy capacity from 2020 onwards in order to
encourage the scale of transformation necessary to meet the
government’s 2050 target of 60% GHG reduction (based on 2000
levels). Table 4 provides a quantiﬁed recommendation in this
context. If the targets outlined in Table 4 were adopted, renew-
able power developers would have a high degree of ﬁnancial
certainty past the 2020 period and would be incentivized to make
the investments necessary to aim for an entrenched market
position beyond 2040. Although it can be argued that such long-
term security can inadvertently encourage commercial apathy

electricity ensures
renewable energy
that even amongst
providers, a high degree of cost competition will ensue as ﬁrms
vie for long-term market share leadership. The ﬁnal target of
120,000 GWh recommended in Table 4 would represent
approximately 50% of Australia’s electricity supply and as such
the dynamics of load balancing would likely catalyze coordinated
initiatives to support the most commercially viable renewable
technology (wind power) through highly responsive technologies
such as geothermal power (the renewable technology that holds
the most potential for providing peak load supply) and natural
gas-ﬁred power. Not only would the extension of the RET
encourage the development of two technologies that are key to
a carbon-free electricity sector (wind power and geothermal
power), the achievement of the targets outlined in Table 4 would
place Australia ﬁrmly on track to achieving the 60% reduction on
GHG emissions levels (based on 2000 emission levels) by 2050
(Government of Australia, 2008b) and position Australia to
achieve the type of aggregate deep emission reductions (in the
range of 80% from 1990 levels) that each nation will have to
make to offset the worst impacts associated with global warming
(Stern, 2006; IPCC, 2007). Obviously, setting such bold wind
power targets would beneﬁt from advances in storage technology.
Therefore, the government should consider ramping up funding
support for storage technology research. This is arguably a more
sustainable use of the AU$2 billion in government funding that
has been earmarked for carbon capture and sequestration
research (Government of Australia, 2009c).

An additional beneﬁt of extending renewable energy generation
targets beyond the 2020 period is that the new targets would
mitigate the threat posed by the multiplier system for small-scale
generators and negate the fourth concern associated with the
current RET that a capped target system does not encourage long-
term market investment. Although, under the proposed target
extensions in Table 4 a cap is still in place, the cap comes into play
far enough into the future to provide the long-term purchase
guarantees (15 years +) necessary to entice wind power develop-
ments (after the incentivization of solar water heaters runs its
course) and provides more time to allow research in renewable
energy technology to yield the cost-saving innovations needed to
compete without market support.

In summary, the best approach for the government is to push for
the passage of the failed CPRS bill provided that the CPRS is robustly
structured to force electricity generators to internalise the external
costs of CO2 emissions – at least to a level that parallels notable
international carbon taxation efforts such as the ETS in the EU.
However, in lieu of an effective ETS, eliminating WCMG from the
RET list of eligible energy sources and extending the RET targets to a
2040 target of 120,000 GWh will enable wind power developers and
other renewable energy developers to achieve the scale of activity
necessary to support the type of radical transition that the nation
acknowledges is necessary in the face of the threats posed by global
warming (Government of Australia, 2009h).

At the end of the day, it comes down to the political will and
capacity of the new Labor government to ﬁght the battles
necessary to infuse the RET with the transformational impact it
was intended to exhibit. In the absence of such political will, like
so many other national governments in states where wind power
is underperforming, it ends up being the governing party in
Australia that is responsible for ‘‘braking wind’’ in Australia.

Making good on Australia’s hydrogen
headstart

Article | Australia | 2024-07-26

The Federal Government is doubling down on its Hydrogen Headstart initiative, which aims

to fuel the growth of Australia’s green hydrogen energy industry. 

With the most recent federal budget, more than $3.3 billion is now going towards
investments to accelerate the nation’s embrace of the future fuel . But Australia already has a
head start on hydrogen energy. 

1

In fact, in 2022, Australia became the first nation to ever export liquid hydrogen. ABB
provided end-to-end engineering and project management support for the Hydrogen Energy

Supply Chain (HESC) pilot, helping liquify hydrogen at the Port of Hastings in Victoria before
shipping it to Kobe, Japan. 

It was a pioneering effort to demonstrate the viability of international, mass-scale hydrogen
transportation networks, and ABB was excited to be involved, supplying everything from
instrumentation and electrification solutions through to automated systems. 

HESC demonstrated that Australia could become a hydrogen energy superpower, but that
does not mean dominance of this new energy market is inevitable. 

Even with other natural advantages, such as renewable energy capacity, proximity to major
Asian export markets and a workforce with highly relevant skills and experience building a
world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry, we still have a way to go  to win
the race. 

Developing a competitive industry that can place Australia at the forefront of becoming a
hydrogen superpower will require coordination of disparate economic actors and integrating

complex supply chains. Partners with broad capabilities will be essential to navigating the
new zero-emissions hydrogen ecosystem.   

Hydrogen energy competition 

The Headstart program has shortlisted six projects for potential share of funding  that
together represent a total electrolyser capacity of more than 3.5 GW – not far off double the
existing global electrolyser capacity. 

2

In addition, a hydrogen production tax incentive worth $6.7 billion will support renewable
hydrogen produced from 2027, while a further boost arrives via the Future Made in Australia
initiative, which seeks to increase investment in hydrogen capacity and green metal
production. 

But this effort is part of a race to hydrogen dominance being fought internationally.

Australia’s measures are competing, for instance, with the US’s Inflation Reduction Act,

which contains the most generous hydrogen subsidies in the world.  Tax credits of up to

3

US$3 a kilogram for green hydrogen mean that the US has already made it cost-competitive

with grey hydrogen.

4

Why hydrogen experience matters 

Of course, creating a green hydrogen ecosystem starts with producing green hydrogen.  

With most green hydrogen production not yet cost-competitive with traditional approaches
to hydrogen production, maximising the efficiency of the plant – such as the electrolysers

green hydrogen production depends on – is vital for the success of green hydrogen energy. 

The faster the industry can drive up overall efficiency, the quicker it becomes cost
competitive not just with grey hydrogen, but with other fossil-fuelled energy sources as well. 
In the French city of Auxerre, an ABB energy management system has reduced energy costs
by up to 16% at a low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution station. 

The station uses ABB’s Optimax software to increase the efficiency of the energy-intensive
electrolysers that are used in green hydrogen production. By providing data to determine
optimal energy consumption levels during the production process, while minimising waste,
the technology improves efficiency at every step of the plant’s lifecycle, from design and
engineering through to operation. 

Optimax also considers such factors as asset availability and price variation, and the
hydrogen produced from the improved electrolysis processes at the plant is used to supply

buses, light commercial vehicles and trucks in the local transit network, saving thousands of
tonnes of carbon emissions each year.    

ABB is also making efficiency gains with modular green hydrogen plants in Italy, using
automation, electrification, and digital leadership in industrial operations to lower the
carbon footprint and reduce operating costs. Leveraging this domain expertise is helping to
minimise the total cost of running the plant, enabling widespread uptake of hydrogen in the
future. 

Energy now, energy later 

The hydrogen ecosystem depends upon more than production, however. A key advantage of
green hydrogen is its ability to store and relocate green energy, but it also comes with some
challenges. 

Hydrogen in gaseous form is three times less energy-dense than methane, making it much
costlier to transport. While it requires less energy to transport hydrogen if it is first
converted to ammonia, this adds environmental risks, and the ammonia will still need to be

converted back to hydrogen at its destination. Although hydrogen can be transferred

through existing pipeline infrastructure, these connections must be retrofitted if they are to

carry a hydrogen blend that exceeds 20%. 

ABB’s transportation technology seeks to address these inefficiencies and technical

challenges by incorporating containerised, modular automation infrastructure; tank farm
automation; and compressor and pumping stations. 

It was ABB technology like this that brought Australia’s HESC pilot into reality. Although

pipelines are suitable for inland transport of bulk quantities of hydrogen, the trans-oceanic
distances involved in HESC require the gas to be converted into a higher density form, such

as liquid. 

Significant costs can be involved in both this conversion process and the transportation.       It is

estimated that the cost of converting and moving hydrogen 1500 km by ship comes to US
$0.6/kg for liquid organic hydrogen compounds, US$1.20/kg for ammonia and US$2/kg for

liquid hydrogen.  Managing collecting systems and tanking facilities in a safe way also
requires specialised technology and deep expertise.

ABB’s support for HESC incorporated electrification and instrumentation solutions, along

with services for production and liquefaction in Australia, as well providing automation for
the regasification plant at the Japanese end.    

Fuelling up 

Once transported, hydrogen needs the right systems and processes in place at the

consumption end before it can be used effectively. Existing infrastructure such as gas

turbines and household appliances can handle a mixture of methane and varying amounts of
methane and hydrogen (5% to 30 %, depending on what is used for), and new designs could

increase the viable concentration of hydrogen.  

Fuel cells are already available in cars and suitable for other transportation systems, and
they’re widely used to provide heat and power for critical infrastructure such as hospitals.

There is potential, too, for residential scale use, although current costs in this sector are
high.  ABB’s domain expertise and understanding is doing much to refine the downstream

processes that make hydrogen consumption more viable. Hydrogen is a highly flexible form
of energy storage, and ABB initiatives have demonstrated how it can be used in small and

large projects on water and on land. 

ABB is working with Hydrogene de France to build megawatt-scale fuel cell systems suitable
for large ocean-going ships, while a 2021 pilot program had fully hydrogen-powered vessels

operating in the Rhone River under the EU’s Flagships initiative. For this, ABB provided fuel
cell-based power and propulsion, which drew entirely on emission-free, shore-based power. 

Another vessel included in the initiative is a self-propelled barge designed to operate on the

Seine in Paris. Originally designed to use diesel-electric power, the barge was reconfigured to
store 350 kg of hydrogen at a pressure of 300 bar, fuelling 200 kW fuel cells supported by

lithium-ion batteries that adjust their power supply to ensure optimal performance. 

On land, the US’s first hydrogen-powered train will operate along a 15 km stretch of track in
San Bernardino, California, as part of the Redlands Passenger Rail Project. The locomotive is

supported by ABB traction systems in the form of a traction converter, a DC/DC converter,
three 28 kWh battery packages, and a battery thermal management system.    

Building partnerships 

The nascent green hydrogen sector needs partners with broad capability across power

systems and process control to simplify the project by reducing the number of cooks in the

kitchen, particularly when managing complex projects spanning sectors such as pipelines,
renewable power and shipping. 

Space for renewable energy generation and supportive government policies are two key

ingredients for building a thriving green hydrogen sector, but there is a third as well –
effective partnerships, to ensure the inputs create quality outcomes. 

As ABB has demonstrated, its expertise has already taken pioneering hydrogen projects from

conception to reality, showing a concrete way forward for a fuel source that is seeing rapid
take up and significant investment. These are the factors helping to take Australia’s innate

strength as a potential player in the green hydrogen ecosystem and make it into a sophisti-
cated and lucrative industry.

and place-based Regional Workforce Transition Plans.

These policies complement the Governmentʼs broader growth
agenda, including our competition reforms, investments in

infrastructure, housing, human capital and defence industry, and

support for small businesses.

The Future Made in Australia agenda will be guided by a new

National Interest Framework to better align economic incentives

with our national interests, which will be established under a Future
Made in Australia Act.

Under the Framework, priority industries will be identified under two

streams. The ‘net zero transformationʼ stream will identify sectors

that can make a significant contribution to achieving net zero,
where Australia has grounds to build enduring sources of

comparative advantage. The ‘economic security and resilienceʼ
stream will identify sectors that are critical to our resilience, are

vulnerable to supply disruptions and that require support to unlock
sufficient private investment.

This Framework will guide Government decision making on

significant public investments, particularly those used to incentivise

private investment at scale. Further detail is outlined in the National
Interest Framework supporting paper published today by the

Treasury.

The Government will also apply Community Benefit Principles to
significant investments in priority industries, which will have a focus

on boosting investment in local communities, supply chains and
skills, and the promotion of diverse workforces and secure jobs.

The Albanese Government recognises that the best opportunities

for Australia and its people lie at the intersection of industry, energy,
resources, skills and our ability to attract and deploy investment.

The Future Made in Australia plan improves our investment

environment and encourages new industries that put us on a path to
net zero and strengthen our economic resilience.

Both developed and developing countries have committed to reduce their emissions through the
increased use of renewable energy. This paper aims to compare renewable energy deployment in
developed and developing countries represented by Australia and China. The paper ﬁrstly argues the
validity of comparison of renewable energy deployment in Australia and China. Then, the governance
structures in both countries are compared; the paper also compares management mechanisms in terms
of funding and incentive support, renewable energy grid-connection and coordination between different
levels of governments in both countries. Moreover, the current status of renewable energy development
in two countries is summarized. From the study, it can be concluded both countries have set a Renewable
Energy Target and promulgated legislation and regulations to enlarge the scale of renewable energy;
China shows a stronger commitment to renewable energy than Australia. However, Renewable Energy
Certiﬁcate mechanism is implemented more effectively in Australia than in China. The paper suggests:
augmenting and rebuilding the electricity network and strengthening coordination between different
levels of governments for both countries; enhancing manufacturing facilities and incentives for the solar
and wind industry for Australia, while developing more-detailed implementation legislation and
renewable power quota system for China.

1. Introduction

Increasing energy demand, security of energy supply and
reduction of emissions are the essential challenges for the world
[1]. Energy consumption which accounts for 60% global greenhouse
gas emissions has mainly contributed to climate change [2]. How
best to combat climate change and global warming while satisfying
the world's energy consumption, without impairing the global
economy is an urgent problem for every country.

Reduction of carbon intensity of energy is important for dealing
with climate change in the future [2]. Renewable energy is an
appropriate way to satisfy energy consumption without environ-
mental degradation. Many countries' governments have committed
to decreasing their emissions and respond actively through pro-
moting renewable energy.

Therefore, in recent years, there are different levels of legislation

and policies promulgated to encourage renewable energy devel-
opment not only in developed countries, but also in developing
countries. By the year of 2013, there were at least 144 countries
which had made different renewable energy targets and policies to
support renewable energy development at the national
level
compared with only 55 countries in 2005. There are also a large
number of state/provincial level and local level policies in different
countries [3].

In 2012, there was $244 billion of total investment in renewable
energy which increased by 8% compared to the 2010 level globally.
Renewable energy supplied approximately 19% of the world's en-
ergy consumption in 2012 [3]. In recent years, renewable energy
has increased strongly in both developed countries and developing
countries.

2. Validity of comparison of renewable energy deployment in
Australia and China

Firstly, comparison can be used as a legitimate and signiﬁcant
method to scientiﬁcally explain and explore how political processes

work [4]. Hill [5] argues it is essential to compare policies for
development of policy theory since comparative analysis could look
at more than one situation which are separated by policy issues,
time and space rather than a particular case occurring at the same
time even in the same place. In a comparative study, it is important
to observe the extent of policy learning between different countries
and over time. Therefore, comparison of renewable energy policies
between different countries would contribute to the worldwide
renewable energy policy study.

achievement

Furthermore, considering the Human Development Index (HDI)
that is a composite index reﬂecting average national human
basic dimensions-
development
knowledge, a decent standard of living and a healthy and long
life. Australia belongs to the group of Very High Human Develop-
ment countries with an HDI of 0.933 and China belongs to the High
Human Development group of countries with an HDI of 0.719.
Australia and China rank at 2 and 91 across the world respectively
[6]. HDI sometimes is used to distinguish whether a country is a
developed or a developing country [7]. Thus, Australia is a devel-
oped country which is in the Very High Human Development
ranking and China is a developing country. Comparative analysis of
renewable energy policy in Australia and China could be the typical
example of renewable energy policy between developed and
developing countries.

Australia is endowed with abundant fossil fuel resources,
which gives Australia a comparative advantage in relatively cheap
electricity. However, high reliance on coal-ﬁred electricity gen-
eration has caused Australia to become the highest per capital
emitter globally [8]. The GHG emissions from fossil fuel produc-
tion and combustion sectors account for 78% of total Australia's
GHG emissions [9]. The electricity generated from fossil fuel, such
as coal, oil and gas accounts for 90% of the total Australian elec-
tricity of which coal provides 68% of total Australian electricity
[10]. The Australia Government pledged it will reduce its
emissions by 5% with unconditional commitment and by 15% or
25% with conditional commitment based on 2000 level by 2020
[11].

On the other hand, Australia is also abundant in renewable
energy resources and it is the sunniest country in the world [12].
Therefore, Australia has potential to develop its renewable energy
to meet increasing energy demand meanwhile reducing the GHG
emissions to respond to climate change proactively.

Compared with Australia, China is a manufacturing and devel-
oping country and therefore the energy demand has risen rapidly in
recent years due to its speedy economic growth and moderniza-
tion. On the other hand, China has become not only the largest
energy consumer but also the largest CO2 emitter in the world [13].
Likewise, the Chinese Government pledged to reduce the amount
of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) by 40%e45% by 2020 based on
2005 level.

Fortunately, China is also rich in renewable resources, such as
solar, wind, hydro, which supplies an opportunity for China to
integrate renewable energy into Chinese energy mix to meet the
energy demand and emission reduction goals.

As discussed above, renewable energy has become a viable
option for both developed and developing countries. Investigating
the governance and management of renewable energy develop-
ment in Australia and China is a meaningful task so that they may
learn from each other and seek co-operation to contribute to
global emission reduction together. There are some similarities
and also differences in the process of development of renewable
energy in both countries. This article will ﬁrstly compare the
governance and management mechanisms in both countries and
then illustrate the status of renewable energy development in
Australia and China.

3. Governance structures and their inﬂuences on renewable
energy development

There are several similarities of renewable energy governance
between Australia and China. Firstly, in order to meet the increasing
energy demand and respond to climate change actively, both
Australia and China have set renewable energy targets at national
level and promulgated national legislation and regulations to pro-
mote renewable energy. Secondly, the state/provincial govern-
ments in both counties set their own renewable energy targets and
released the state/provincial renewable energy legislation and
regulations considering their regional renewable resources. How-
ever, they must comply with pertinent national legislation and
regulations to ensure their own targets can be reached within the
required time. In the light of different political systems in Australia
and China, the following sections discuss the detailed governance
structure in both countries respectively.

3.1. Governance structure of renewable energy development in
Australia

In 2000, the Australian Government issued the Mandatory
Renewable Energy Target (MRET) which set 9500 GWh by 2010 to
encourage renewable energy investment through tradable renew-
able energy certiﬁcates (RECs, 1 REC ¼ 1 MWh of electricity). This
legislative target was met ahead in 2007. In 2009, the Australian
Government implemented the Renewable Energy Target (RET)
which was expanded from MRET. This target was designed to
guarantee renewable resources will supply 20% of total Australian
electricity by 2020 including meeting the 45,000 GWh renewable
energy target. In January 2011, the RET was divided into two parts:
the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) and Small-scale
Renewable Energy Target (SRET). This change aims to create sepa-
rate incentives for large-scale renewable energy projects and small-
scale technology which can decrease the competition with each
other in the RET scheme [14].

In order to facilitate the implementation of RET scheme, the
Australian Government promulgated national acts to ensure the
target can be met in future. There are some legislations, such as
Renewable Energy (electricity) Act 2000, Renewable Energy (Elec-
(Small-scale Technology shortfall Charge) Act 2010,
tricity)
Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Large-scale Generation Shortfall
charge) Act 2000 and Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulation
2001. This legislation establishes the liability framework, identiﬁes
the means of creating certiﬁcates and administration of arrange-
ment and imposes the large-scale generation and small-scale
technology shortfall charge at $65 per MWh. These Acts place a
legal obligation onto the liable entities. This means the electricity
retailers and other large buyers are required to purchase renewable
energy certiﬁcates (RECs) from accredited renewable energy pro-
viders [14]. If these entities cannot meet the required quotas, they
would get ﬁned at $65 per MWh for shortfalls. The RECs can be
used to demonstrate the liable entities' compliance with require-
ment of RET as a ‘currency’ form [15].

The Carbon Price commenced from 1 July 2012. To some extent,
it has enhanced the competition of renewable energy with fossil
fuel through increasing the cost of fossil fuel generation and make
renewable energy more viable. This is because cost is the major
barrier for renewable energy development which requires much
higher up-front capital cost compared with fossil fuel generators.
Another reason is that cost and risk of fossil fuel electricity are
historically externalized, which leads to the lower private costs but
higher social cost compared with renewable energy, and further
decreases the competitiveness of renewable energy [16]. Carbon
Price in Australia aimed to internalize environmental costs of fossil

1046

fuel due to its emission. However, following a change in Govern-
ment in 2013 the current government, as one of its ﬁrst legislative
changes, repealed the Carbon Price from 1 July, 2014. In addition a
review of the renewable energy target, RET, was undertaken and
recommended in August 2014 that the target be signiﬁcantly
reduced. As yet no agreed decision has been made on what the RET
reduction should be. This has caused a great degree of uncertainty
in the renewable energy market and investment has signiﬁcantly
declined, with some investors leaving the country and employment
in renewables dropping. This will weaken the competitiveness of
renewable energy again in future if the Government does not
introduce other support policies. Therefore, in Australia, instability
of current support policies that may change with whichever po-
litical party is in power, causes renewable energy deployment to
suffer with stop-and-go situations inﬂuencing Australian renew-
able energy development [17e19].

The RET implementation is overseen by the Clean Energy
Regulator (CER) which also administrates the compliance with
associated requirement by legislation. National policy and the legal
framework are managed by the Department of Industry (DOI). The
other responsible governmental agency is Australian Renewable
Energy Agency (ARENA) which commenced operation in 1 July
2012 to supply funding support for renewable energy project,
research and development activities together with knowledge
capturing and sharing activities. ARENA had a $2.5 billion budget
[20]. However, after the 2014 Budget funding for ARENA was
reduced to $331 million in 2014e15, and $15 million in 2015e16
and 2016e17. This is a massive reduction in funds.

Renewable energy policy in Australia is subject to regulations
and inﬂuenced ﬁscally by all three spheres of governments which
are the federal, state and local governments. These three Govern-
ments are coordinated by the Council of Australian Government
(COAG) [21]. In Australia, the State government plays a signiﬁcant
role in renewable energy utilization.

Additionally,

the Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial
Research Organization (CSIRO) is a federal government funded
national science agency researching and developing solar, wind,
geothermal and other renewable technologies. The National Solar
Energy Centre that is located in the CSIRO Energy Centre specializes
in R&D of the advanced solar technologies including concentrated
solar thermal, photovoltaics and solar cooling [22]. CSIRO also in-
ﬂuences the decision-making of the renewable energy policies and
the commercialization of
renewable energy technologies in
Australia as well.

3.2. Governance structure of renewable energy development in
China

In China, the Chinese central government plays an important
role in renewable energy development and deployment. To enlarge
the scale of renewable energy application while meeting the 40%e
45% of emissions reduction by 2020, the Renewable Energy Law
(REL) of People's Republic of China, was put into effect on 1 January
2006. The purpose of the Renewable Energy Law is promoting the
development and utilization of renewable energy, diversifying
energy supplies, safeguarding energy security, improving energy
structures, protecting the environment and considering the eco-
nomic and socially sustainable development. The priority of energy
development was given to the renewable energy promotion and
utilization. Moreover, solar, wind, hydro, biomass, geothermal,
ocean and other non-fossil energy were all deﬁned as renewable
energy in the law [23]. The renewable energy law was created as a
framework for renewable energy development in China. Renewable
Energy Law was amended in 2009 in which there were some
important changes to improve the implementation of the REL

including enhancement of mandatory connection and purchase
policy; streamlining renewable energy fund and strengthening the
central governments' oversight of provincial and local govern-
ments' renewable energy planning and implementation [24]. The
amended law was effective from 1 April 2010.

In order to implement and complement the REL effectively, in
August 2007, the Mid- and Long-term Development Plan for
Renewable Energy (MLDP) was released, in which the Chinese
Government set the target for future renewable energy application.
The target is e renewable energy will supply 15% by 2020 of total
energy consumption in China. In addition, the China 12th Five Year
Plan for Renewable Energy Plan (2011e2015) set speciﬁc targets for
different renewable sources. Comparing with China, Australia has
no primary energy reduction target but an electricity reduction
target of 20% by 2020 and a greenhouse gas reduction target of 5%.
In China, there is no special government authority that is in full
charge of renewable energy deployment [25]. Instead, more than
ten regulations are in place and several national agencies are
involved in renewable energy policies-making. The National
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released The
Regulation on Administration of Power Generation from Renewable
Energy (NDRC Energy [2006] No.13); the State Electricity Regula-
tory Commission (SERC) which is responsible for regulating and
overseeing China's electricity industry published the Measures on
Supervision and Administration of Grid Enterprises in the Purchase
of Renewable Energy Power (SERC [2007] No. 25). These regula-
tions and measures were designed to remove the barriers to China's
renewable energy development and ensure the reasonable return
of renewable energy producers and provide an incentive to the
market-based renewable energy industry. There is another gov-
ernment agency, the National Energy Administration (NEA) sitting
within the NDRC which is responsible for energy planning. The
large-scale application demonstration area scheme for distributed
photovoltaic power generation has been proposed by NEA.
Furthermore, taking into consideration of restrictions in suitable
conditions, such as geographical location, power grid and resources
and so on, the combination of the large scale mass exploitation and
distributed development will be applied in renewable energy
development. Therefore, the distributed electricity will become the
main route for future Chinese renewable energy application [26].
Additionally, NDRC Pricing Bureau is in charge of setting the price
for energy,
including setting renewable energy feed-in tariff;
Meanwhile, Ministry of Finance is in charge of providing funds for
renewable energy programs. Besides, Ministry of Science and
Technology (MOST), the Ministry of Environmental Protection
(MOEP), the Ministry of Housing and UrbaneRural Development
(MOHURD),
the General
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA),
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine
(AQSIQ) are also involved in renewable energy policy making.
However, it is very difﬁcult to coordinate different governmental
authorities due to undertaking various functions [25]. As a result,
regulatory system of renewable energy is inconsistent and regula-
tions from different government authorities are heavily overlapped
in China [27]. A separated political and regulatory authority that is
fully in charge of renewable energy is recommended for China in
future.

In addition,

there are also non-government organizations
involved in renewable energy development in China which can be
categorized as academic research associations, industrial associa-
tions and the organizations conducting special activities in relevant
area of renewable energy. The Chinese Renewable Energy Society
(CRES) has been involved in drafting and research on renewable
energy laws, regulations and technical standards and is one of
many organizations taking part but it might be the most important
non-government organization of renewable energy in China [28].

4. Compare management mechanisms between two
countries

Both Australia and China have made great efforts to promote
renewable energy deployment through different policy supports
under their governance structure. There are several similarities and
differences regarding to various aspects between two countries.

4.1. Funding and incentive support

Both countries have supplied funds to promote renewable en-
ergy. In Australia, Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has
been established with a budget of $10 billion which provides the
ﬁnancial support for renewable energy, low emissions technologies
and energy efﬁciency projects over 5 years from 1 July 2013;
However, the new Government wishes to abolish the CEFC and will
do so if it has the opportunity. ARENA has $2.5 billion to be
administered for renewable energy deployment, research and
development, commercialization and demonstration although the
fund has been reduced from $3.2 billion due to $435 million
funding cut by the Abbott Government and an announced $370
million deferral by Labor in 2013 [20]. Launched by the Gillard
Government in the early 2012 to accelerate transition to a cleaner
future, the Clean Technology Program included $200 million Clean
Technology Innovation Program for clean technology research and
development, $200 million Clean Technology Food and Foundries
Investment Program and $800 million for the Clean Technology
Investment Program for incentivizing manufacturers to reduce
pollution and improve energy efﬁciency. However, currently, the
Abbott Government has announced they intend to discontinue
funding for the Clean Technology Program with abolishment of the
Carbon Price. Therefore, these three programs have been closed to
new applications [29]. Unfortunately in Australia, as in many other
countries, when there a change in Government occurs, some
existing programs are terminated.

There were also renewable energy rebate schemes deployed by
the Australian Government, such as the Solar Homes and Com-
munities Plan, Residential and Medium-scale sub-program,

These past funding initiatives and programs have effectively
promoted renewable energy development in Australia. However,
the most effective scheme to increase residential roof top solar in
Australia was the state-based feed-in tariff. A scheme introduced
and administered, with slightly differing ﬁnancial programs, by the
States. It was a highly effective initiative as shown in Fig. 1, although
it was so effective that the scheme was stopped at the end of 2013.
However, as a result of it 2% of Australia's electricity is now from
residential roof top solar and in States like South Australia almost
25% of households have PV on their roofs in 2014.

As there was never a national feed-in-tariff scheme in Australia
and the State based schemes were only applied to small-scale
systems and mostly for solar PV [21], the large-scale renewable
energy application is impeded in Australia. Furthermore, Courvi-
sanos & Effendi [31] argued that renewable energy gains less
ﬁnancial support from the Australian Government compared with
fossil fuel sector. Riedy [32] estimates that most of the $10 billion
annual subsidy to energy sector ﬂowed into the fossil fuel sector;
and only 4% went to renewable energy sector in 2005e2006
ﬁnancial year. There are also substantial funds from the Australian
Government supporting clean coal research design and develop-
ment (RD & D) [33]. Byrnes et al. argue the government funding
prefers mature technologies and this may cause signiﬁcant in-
vestment to ﬂow to gas which is considered as a scalable and
reasonably mature technology. According to Byrnes et al. [16], there
was only 50% of $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation are
committed to support renewable energy application (including
hybrids). However, once the CEFC closes down it is not known how
much funding will exist for large-scale renewable. This is mainly
because fossil fuel plays an important role in Australia's economy. It
is difﬁcult to change the current situation in which fossil fuel
cannot be challenged by renewable energy.

Compared with Australia, China has more speciﬁc funding
support programs to different stakeholders and shows more ﬁrm
conﬁdence in renewable energy development. This might be due to
the huge annual energy consumption and a lack of fossil fuel re-
sources in China.

There are economic incentive policies carried out by the Chinese
Government, such as tax preferential policy for enterprises which

engage in renewable energy projects, price preferential policy that
ensure the renewable producer can cover costs and gain reasonable
proﬁt through setting national feed-in-tariffs with differing values
depending on the type of renewable source and for different sized
generator, and investment subsidy policy which has been imple-
mented through different programs [34].

In 2009, in order to assist Chinese photovoltaic industry devel-
opment under the circumstance of its high dependence on export
and aggravated by trade frictions with the United States and the
European Union, the Chinese Government rolled out two programs.
One is Solar Roofs Program which aimed to supply subsidy to build
integrated photovoltaic system with 20 RMB/W and rooftop system
with 15 RMB/W in 2009 [35]. With the decrease of the price of solar
PV modules, the subsidy has been decreased to 7.5 RMB/W for
rooftop system and 9 RMB/W for BIPV system later [36], (on 31 July
of 2014, 1 AUD ¼ 5.74 RMB). In July of 2009, in order to further
develop the solar energy application, the Chinese Government
implemented the “Golden Sun Pilot Project” which aims to subsidize
50% of the total cost including transmission and distribution net-
works to the projects that meet relevant criteria. If the project is in
rural areas without grid coverage, the supplied subsidy can be as
high as 70% of total investment [37]. Moreover, the ﬁrst 108 Green
Energy Demonstration Counties have been approved by the Chinese
Government in the mid of 2011 [38]. 200 Green Energy Counties
construction will be ﬁnished in the end of 2015 in China. In addition,
100 New Energy Demonstration Cities will be built in future [26].

With respect to renewable energy manufacturing, China is
committed to developing a strong renewable energy industry
contrary to the Australian Government's attitude. According to Liu
et al. [13], currently, China has become the largest producer and
consumer of solar water heaters in the world which accounts for
50% of global production and 65% of global total installation; China
also supplies 30% of world's PV panels and ranks second in wind
power production. Compared with China, Australia has world-class
renewable technologies, but it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd suitable local
manufacturers which have capability and interest to transformed
commercialized technology into the real product under govern-
ment funded programs [39]. There is a lack of manufacturing fa-
cilities for solar and wind industry in Australia [21], since with a
population just 1/60 that of China Australia does not have the local
market that China has.

4.2. Renewable energy grid-connection

Renewable energy grid-connection is a major issue in both
countries. There are some similarities between Australia and China.
As renewable electricity increases, insufﬁcient electricity network
capability is reported in both countries. It is urgent and necessary to
extend and upgrade the present electricity network, to meet the

renewable energy target in Australia [40]. In China, there is a
bottleneck between the increasing renewable energy production
and inadequate electricity grid-connection facilities [37]. Therefore,
augmenting and rebuilding a network that has sufﬁcient capacity
and ﬂexibility to facilitate renewable energy grid-connection is
suggested for both countries.

There is also a difference related to this issue between the two
countries. The Australian Government implements RET through
Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs) which place a legal obligation
onto electricity retailers and other large wholesale buyers to source
a proportional share of the target from eligible renewable energy
sources (1 REC ¼ 1 MWh). RECs are a tradable commodity and,
depending on the price received aid the competitiveness of
renewable electricity. Currently, with the aid of RECs, both wind and
roof top solar are most competitive with fossil fuels. Compared with
Australia, China's renewable energy grid-connection is operating at
a lower efﬁciency level, although Renewable Portfolio Standard
(RPS) which was introduced by NDRC in 2007 in MLDP requires
electricity retailers to purchase a certain quantity of renewable
energy [41]. Grid companies were assigned to have 1% and 3% non-
hydro of renewable energy by 2010 and 2020 respectively and
generators were assigned 3% and 8% non-hydro by 2010 and 2020
respectively in their generation mix [42]. However, there are some
grid ﬁrms that are reluctant to connect renewable energy into
network [43]. It was reported that none of six largest generators met
the 3% of renewable energy requirement and there is no report
about imposing penalties for non-compliance grid companies in
China [24]. On one hand, due to a lack of monitoring and compliance
requirement and the grid companies' consideration of the possible
destabilization to networks by accidents occurring, the grid com-
panies are reluctant to accept the renewable electricity in some
places [24]. Qiu & Li [27] argue current renewable energy laws are
too ambiguous to enforce and more-detailed implementation
legislation is recommended for better enforcement. Contrary to the
situation in China,
in Australia, the substantial barrier is the
connection cost rather than technical issues [44]. On the other hand,
focus of installed capacity rather than generation is another reason
of poor integration of renewable energy into grid. Thus, the
renewable power quota system and developing technical standards
for renewable energy grid-connection should be suggested for
China. Fortunately, the Draft Renewable Power Regulation has been
issued for public discussion now in China. It is reported that
Renewable Power Regulation will be promulgated in 2015, which
will hopefully increase renewable energy integration into grid.

4.3. Coordination between different levels of governments

Jones [39] argues that there is a lack of coordination between
in Australia.

the federal government and state government

Y. Hua et al. / Renewable Energy 85 (2016) 1044e1051

the mix of energy consumption.

When it comes to the electricity generation by fuel type in both
countries, as shown in Table 2, in 2011e2012, the total electricity
generation in Australia is about 2.54 * 105 GWh in which there are
2.4 * 104 GWh from renewables. This accounts for 9.4% including
5.5% from hydro of total electricity generation in Australia. Mean-
while, in China, in 2012 as shown in Fig. 3, the Chinese electricity
generation is about 4.98 * 106 GWh,
in which there are
1.007 * 106 GWh from renewables. This shares about 20.2%
including 17.4% from hydro of total electricity generation in China.
Therefore, the percentages of non-hydro renewable electricity in
both Australia and China are similar (3e4%), which is considered
very small.

On the other hand, there is another similarity of status of
renewable energy in both countries. This is the percentages of
electricity from all renewables (9.4% in Australia; 20.2% in China)
are higher than the percentages of energy consumption from re-
newables (4.3% in Australia; 9.0% in China). This means the elec-
tricity generation is the dominated form of renewable application.

6. Conclusion and recommendation

Development of renewable energy has been considered as a
viable option to meet the increasing energy consumption and
reduce carbon emissions effectively in both developed and devel-
oping countries. Both Australia and China have set renewable en-
ergy targets to enlarge the scale of renewable energy application,
introduced legislation and regulations at national and state/pro-
vincial level, implemented different governmental programs and
provided incentives and funding to ensure their targets can be met
in required time. A uniﬁed and top-down approach is applied to
implement renewable energy programs and policies in China
whereas there are more strong decision-making and diversity of
renewable energy policies among the state governments in
Australia.

The Chinese Government is now confronted more severely with
conﬂict about energy supply and environmental protection so that
it shows more conﬁdence in renewable energy development
compared with the Australian Government.

The Chinese Government shows a stronger commitment to
renewable energy than Australia, though both countries still have a
very low penetration of non-hydro renewable energy in their pri-
mary energy mix. China also supplies signiﬁcant incentives for
renewable energy manufacturers to boost relevant industries while

Sometimes state schemes are not coordinated with the federal
schemes. This causes barriers for renewable energy development in
Australia. Schuman & Lin [24] report that in China provincial
renewable energy planning and development lacks coordination
with the central government as well. Hence, strengthening coor-
dination between federal/central government and state/provincial
government is suggested for both countries.

5. The status of renewable energy development in Australia
and China

As shown in the following table and ﬁgures, Table 2, Figs. 2 and 3
show the energy consumption and electricity generation by fuel
type in Australia and China respectively.

In terms of energy consumption, as shown in Table 2, during
2011e2012, the total energy consumption in Australia was about
1.72 * 106 GWh, in which there are 7.36 * 104 GWh from renewables.
The energy from renewables accounts for 4.3% of total energy
consumption in Australia, including 0.82% from hydro. Compared
with Australia, Fig. 2 shows in China, in 2012, the total energy
consumption is about 9.05 * 106 GWh (3620 million tce,
1 GWh ¼ 400 tce), in which there are 8.25 * 105 GWh from re-
newables. This constitutes about 9.0% including 7.8% from hydro of
total energy consumption in China. Therefore, if hydro power is
removed, renewable energy shares more of total energy con-
sumption in Australia than China, though much of Australia's
renewable energy is from biomass. In China, as a percentage of total
energy, non-hydro renewables play a very small part, only 1.2% in

Fig. 2. 2012 China's total primary energy consumption.

manufacturing industry although it has world-class renewable
energy technologies and resources. However, with respect to
renewable energy integration, Australia's Renewable Energy Cer-
tiﬁcate mechanism is implemented more effectively than China's
due to guaranteeing renewable energy can be purchased by elec-
tricity companies by legislation. Furthermore, both countries are
suffering the dilemma in which their electricity network has lagged
behind the renewable energy development. Additionally, both
countries lack coordination between the central/federal govern-
ment and provincial/state governments.

Therefore, augmenting and rebuilding the electricity network to
and
the renewable energy integration requirement
meet
strengthening coordination between federal/central government
and state/provincial governments are recommended for both
Australia and China. Enhancing manufacturing facilities and in-
centives for the solar and wind industries is recommended for
Australia while promulgating more-detailed implementation
legislation for better enforcement and developing a renewable
power quota system and technical standards for renewable energy
grid-connection is suggested for China. Moreover, for both coun-
tries, developing cost effective and environmentally benign storage
technologies and systems and integration technologies to deal with
future high penetration of intermittent power generation in the
electricity network will be areas of future importance.

Hydrogen Headstart program

The Australian Government has announced a further $2 billion for an additional round of Hydrogen Headstart. This funding was

announced in the 2024-25 Federal budget. 

Register your interest in Hydrogen Headstart Round 2  (https://arena.gov.au/funding/hydrogen-headstart-round2/) .

The Australian Government is investing $4 billion in the Hydrogen Headstart program. Headstart will provide revenue support for large-scale

renewable hydrogen projects through competitive hydrogen production contracts.

This investment will:

accelerate development of Australia’s hydrogen industry

catalyse clean energy industries

help Australia connect to new global hydrogen supply chains.

Headstart will take advantage of hydrogen's immense jobs and investment potential.

It will help bridge the commercial gap for first mover projects.

A further $4 million will be provided to help First Nations communities engage with hydrogen project developers.

Unlocking a vibrant domestic hydrogen industry is critical to our vision of being a Renewable Energy Superpower and for a future made in

Australia.

How will it work?

The program uses a competitive process to select large Australian-based projects. It focuses on projects producing hydrogen from renewable

energy, or derivative products (for example ammonia or methanol).

Successful projects will have the opportunity to receive funding as a production credit. This funding credit will cover the current commercial

gap between the cost of producing renewable hydrogen and its market price. This should enable producers to offer hydrogen to users at a price

that will encourage its use.

The Australian Government announced (/about/news/hydrogen-headstart-applicants-are-potential-world-leaders) shortlisted projects on 21

December 2023.

The Solar Sunshot program, announced by the federal government earlier

this month as a way “to supercharge Australia’s ambition to become a

renewable energy superpower at home and abroad,” will see the

government funding production subsidies and grants under the auspices

of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

The $1 billion (USD 650 million) initiative aims to support manufacturing

facilities in Australia across the solar supply chain, including polysilicon

production, production of ingots, wafers, solar PV cells, and solar module

assembly. The program may also support complementary aspects of the

PV supply chain such as solar glass, module frames and deployment

technology.

ARENA, which will design the program in collaboration with the

Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water

(DCCEEW), has now published a consultation paper outlining a proposed

structure for the package that could see it delivered through a series of

funding rounds supporting targeted stages of the supply chain.

Under the program, production-linked payments are proposed to be the

primary form of  nancial support. ARENA said it will also assess how

capital grant funding or other forms of concessional support can be used

to complement production-linked payments to achieve the program

objectives.

ARENA is seeking information on prospective projects under development

or project concepts that could fall under the Solar Sunshot umbrella. The

agency said this will enable it to better understand overall readiness and

appetite of the market to develop projects in di erent areas of the supply

chain and will be used to develop  nal design parameters for the program.

ARENA Chief Executive Darren Miller said the agency will work closely

with industry to shape a program that supports “innovative and

competitive solar PV manufacturing that is critical to securing Australia’s

role in the transition to a net zero world.”

“The scale at which solar needs to be deployed to meet our climate targets

means that we cannot rely solely on importing solar panels from

overseas,” he said, adding that Australia can drive a greater role in PV

production to make the supply chain less vulnerable.

“There is a credible pathway for building a solar manufacturing industry in

Australia,” he said. “A collaborative and committed approach from

government and the private sector gives us the best chance at tackling this

challenge.”

The consultation remains open until 31 May 2024 with ARENA accepting

written submissions through online forms and also hosting two

consultation webinars.

The Hon Anthony Albanese MP, Prime Minister of Australia

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Australia is a step closer to manufacturing more reliable renewables at home, with the Albanese Government’s $1 billion Solar

Sunshot program now open.

Australia has always been a solar powerhouse – the ideas invented here have lit the way for the global energy transformation

underway. 

But while one in three Australian households have solar – the highest take-up in the world – only one per cent of those solar panels

have been made in Australia.

That’s why we’re investing in Australia’s solar capability with targeted funding to support a Future Made In Australia, create quality

jobs for Australian workers and a more resilient supply chain.

The International Energy Agency estimates 1300 manufacturing jobs for each gigawatt of solar PV production, meaning a

supercharged domestic industry will create thousands of jobs in Australia.

Initiatives like Solar Sunshot will build  capability in the energy supply chains of the future, and support more manufacturing

opportunities across the country driven by our renewable transformation.

The first $550 million, administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), will support the commercialisation of

Australian solar photovoltaic (PV) innovations and scale up Australian solar PV manufacturing. This includes: 

Round 1A: $500 million to support solar panel manufacturing, here in Australia, with a focus on modules, inputs to modules,

and deployment systems.

Round 1B: $50 million to fund solar PV manufacturing studies, including feasibility and engineering.

As the Treasury’s National Interest Framework sets out: the high concentration of supply chains for critical energy technologies

poses risks to Australia’s energy security and economic resilience.

These technologies are critical to Australia’s energy security through the net zero transformation.

We know there is strong interest from business to work with the Government to make more critical energy hardware here including

high tech Australian start-ups, local fabricators and material suppliers, and international investors.

Community benefit principles – including for supply chains, diverse workforces and secure jobs – are central to Government

investment through Future Made In Australia.

The Solar Sunshot program reflects this intent and will encourage investment in the people, communities and regions that will drive

solar PV supply chains and the broader net zero transformation.

Quotes attributable to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese:

“I want a future made in Australia. And I want a future made in our regions. Places like the Hunter, Gladstone, Rockhampton and the

Spencer Gulf.

“Because Australia can do what other countries cannot. We have that combination of resources, skills, workers, space and sunlight to

co-locate those links in the value chain.

“Solar Sunshot is about building on those strong foundations, building resilience into Australia’s renewable energy supply chains,

and building a Future Made in Australia.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen:

“When it comes to powering Australia’s future nothing will beat our sun and our solar knowhow. That’s why bringing solar

manufacturing to our shores is so critical for unlocking our future as a renewable energy superpower and securing the job of the

future.

“Diverse, secure and resilient supply chains – supported by more onshore manufacturing across more of the value chain – are too

important to our security and success to leave to hope.

“Now is the time to take advantage of some of the best solar resources and renewable energy expertise in the world.

“Only the Albanese Government is backing businesses across the country to seize the opportunity of a Future Made in Australia,

powered by reliable renewables.”

The Solar Sunshot program is seeking to revamp Australia's solar panel manufacturing
industry by facilitating a transition from extracting and exporting materials to full scale

industry by facilitating a transition from extracting and exporting materials to full-scale
solar panel production, a strategy it has dubbed “pit to panel.”

With abundant reserves of metals and minerals like aluminium, phosphate, silica-bearing
quartz and copper, Australia is looking to establish a robust domestic supply chain for solar
panels.

“Historically, Australia has been good at going from the mining pit to port, and long may
this continue. But the Australian Government will also invest in the path from pit to panels
and capture more value for our economy and workforce,” said Australian Prime Minister
Anthony Albanese in a March 28 press release.

The initiative comes as the nation grapples with economic shifts following the closure of
coal- red power stations.

By investing in strategic manufacturing capabilities and promoting innovation, the
government wants to create a competitive solar panel manufacturing industry that
contributes to job creation and regional development.

It also wants to boost the local solar panel manufacturing industry in response to growing
demand. Currently, over 3.7 million Australian households have installed solar panels, but
only 1 percent of those were made locally.

Although it has acknowledged the dominance of Chinese solar panel manufacturers, the
Australian government is con dent in the competitiveness of its own solar panel
manufacturing sector.

By providing subsidies, grants and support through agencies like the Australian Renewable
Energy Agency, the government hopes to nurture domestic companies and enhance
Australia's footing in the renewable energy sector.

The Solar Sunshot program is also aligned with broader initiatives aimed at achieving net-
zero emissions and fostering economic transformation, speci cally the establishment of
the Net Zero Economy Authority.

Regions like the Upper Spencer Gulf stand to play a signi cant role in driving the nation's
transition to a net-zero economy. With increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), the
South Australian government is tapping into the region’s rich copper reserves and other
critical minerals, such as magnetite iron ore, through the State Prosperity Project.

This will be supported by the planned Northern Water project, which involves the
construction of a 600 kilometre pipeline connected to a large-scale desalination plant for
ease of mineral delivery.

Chinese solar panel makers could be sti  competition

Albanese emphasized that Australia's strong mineral endowment positions Solar Sunshot
for success.

“We have every metal and critical mineral necessary to be a central player in the net zero
transformation and a proven track record as a reliable energy producer and exporter,"" he
said, adding, ""We can also invest in strategic manufacturing capability, particularly in
components critical to the energy and economic transition.""

Even so, some experts see challenges ahead for the Solar Sunshot initiative given that the
solar panel industry is dominated by overseas giants with advanced manufacturing
capabilities.

Tony Wood, the Grattan Institute's energy program director, cautioned that Australia faces
cutthroat competition in a Chinese-dominated manufacturing industry. With just one
domestic manufacturer, Adelaide-based Tindo Solar, Australia's solar panel production
capacity falls far short of meeting the surging demand for solar panels, particularly
compared to industry leaders like Tongwei (SHA:600438) and JA Solar (NASDAQ:JASO).

While breakthroughs in solar panel technology are encouraged, he warned against

overzealousness in an attempt to jumpstart large-scale production, particularly in an
investment as big as Solar Sunshot.

“Every now and again there are people who will make breakthroughs to improve the
e ciency of solar. That’s a good thing and should be encouraged, possibly with small
research grants, but not a $1 billion backstop,"" Wood said.

“This is a very dangerous place for young, commercial players.""

CEFC targets biggest emissions
abatement in largest wind farm
investment

30 November 2022 

The CEFC has announced a market-leading wind investment, with its single largest investment in a wind project – which is also targeting its single largest
emissions abatement.  

Critically, the CEFC investment in Victoria’s Golden Plains Wind Farm also draws in substantial new investors at a time when Australia is accelerating its
renewable energy ambitions. 

The CEFC has committed up to $175 million* to develop Stage 1 of the Golden Plains Wind Farm, near Geelong. The project will include 122 wind turbines
and generate 756.4 MW of clean energy to replace coal-fired generation. The estimated annual emissions abatement is an average 770,000 tonnes CO2-
e, or more than 23 million tonnes CO2-e over the project’s 30-year lifetime.  

Golden Plains Wind Farm is the first fully merchant wind farm in Australia to be financed by commercial lenders, with the CEFC commercial debt
package crowding in an additional $1.8 billion of private sector capital. This includes 100 per cent equity from clean energy investor TagEnergy, in its first
Australian investment. Debt providers include Westpac, Bank of China, Mizuho, German state-owned investment bank KfW, the Commonwealth Bank,
and Danish Credit Export Agency EKF.  

TagEnergy, part of the Impala SAS Group, has acquired Stage 1 of Golden Plains Wind Farm from WestWind Energy, which will manage the development
for 30 years and work to bring Stage 2 to fruition. TagEnergy now has close to 1 GW of wind and storage assets in construction and operation globally,
among a portfolio of almost 4 GW of wind, solar and battery storage projects in five countries. 

Danish wind farm manufacturer and supplier Vestas will supply the turbines, in what will be its largest onshore wind farm in the Asia Pacific region.  

CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth said: “COP27 reminded the world that we must act urgently to reduce emissions. As Australia galvanises its efforts to
decarbonise, CEFC capital is driving a material increase in our clean energy generation capacity to help reach net zero emissions by 2050.  

“Large scale wind developments like Golden Plains Wind Farm enable Australia to capitalise on our abundant natural resources so we can decarbonise
our energy grid and fill the gap in energy supply caused by the accelerated exit of coal fired power stations. 

“This landmark project demonstrates the ongoing evolution of the CEFC after 10 years of investment. Our investment expertise is helping the clean
energy sector overcome significant headwinds, including supply-chain issues, rising prices and higher interest rates. As a critical contributor to the

Australian Government’s Rewiring the Nation strategy, the CEFC is helping build a 21st century grid that will deliver clean energy to homes and
businesses around Australia.” 

TagEnergy CEO Franck Woitiez said: “We are delighted to work with the CEFC in our first investment in Australia. The CEFC’s ten years of experience
developing Australia’s wind farm sector, combined with our deep expertise, enthusiasm and commitment to this market, will bring long term benefits to
Australia, through clean energy generation, emissions reduction and economic opportunities.” 

CEFC Head of Wind Investment Joe Harber said: “The investment reflects the long term and successful CEFC investment strategy of supporting clean
energy projects ahead of securing power purchase agreements. By offering a financial bridge between development and contracting, we can fast track
the construction of these vital assets and make a meaningful contribution to emissions reduction.   

“We are particularly pleased to enable these commercial banks to reach financial close on their first fully merchant wind farm. By filling this significant
financing gap for developers, CEFC capital is supporting the accelerated development of critical clean energy projects essential to our decarbonisation.” 

TagEnergy estimates that when complete, the 1,300 MW Golden Plains Wind Farm will generate enough clean energy to power more than 750,000
homes, the equivalent of every home in regional Victoria.  

Golden Plains Wind Farm will be built in the South West Victoria Renewable Energy Zone, which AEMO has identified as having good access to existing
network capacity, system strength and resource potential. Construction is expected to begin in early 2023, with operations due to commence in 2025. 

*The CEFC has committed a total of $350 million to Stages One and Two of the Golden Plains Wind Farm

Australian Government

www.cefc.com.au (https://
www.cefc.com.au/)

The  CEFC  was  established  under  the  Clean  Energy
Finance  Corporation  Act  2012  (CEFC  Act),  passed  by
the Parliament of Australia on 22 July 2012.[1] It was established on 3 August 2012[2] and commenced
making investment commitments from 1 July 2013.

The  organisation  did  not  always  enjoy  the  support  of  Government.  In  2013  Opposition  leader  Tony
Abbott wrote to the CEFC asking it to stop making new loans and to cease assessing new projects.[3]
CEFC  chair  Jillian  Braodbent  later  told  ABC  radio  the  new  government  should  ""break  an  election
promise"" and keep the CEFC in operation, citing a 7% profit. Coalition Senator Arthur Sinodinos said
that  if  it  is  making  a  profit,  it  should  survive  without  the  government  and  essentially  confirmed  the
government  would  shut  the  corporation  down.[4]  Legislation  to  abolish  the  CEFC  and  transfer  the
CEFC's existing assets and liabilities to the Commonwealth was blocked by non-government senators.
In July 2015, Abbott said he would ban the CEFC from investing in wind power[5] and rooftop solar.[6]
Prime  Minister  Malcolm  Turnbull  lifted  the  ban  in  2015,  reportedly  directing  the  CEFC  to  focus  on
innovative and emerging technologies, reversing the position of his predecessor Abbott.[7]

Ian  Learmonth  was  appointed  CEO  in  March  2017.[8]  In  August  2017  Steven  Skala  was  appointed
chair of the board.[9]

An  independent  statutory  review  of  the  CEFC  Act  found  that  the  CEFC  had  facilitated  the  flows  of
finance  into  the  clean  energy  sector,  successfully  enabling  projects  that  would  not  have  otherwise
proceeded,  attracting  substantial  private  co-investment  to  projects.  The  statutory  review  was
conducted  by  Deloitte  and  tabled  in  Parliament  on  14  December  2018.[10]  The  CEFC  submission  to
the Statutory Review of the Corporation is also publicly available.[11]

Then Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison subsequently said ""The fact Australia leads the world
in per capita investment in clean energy, we have the world's most successful green bank in the Clean
Energy Finance Corporation, and that we're on track to have around a quarter of our electricity needs
met by renewables by 2020, all underscores the work underway to reduce our global emissions.""[12]

In  mid-2022,  the  Australian  Parliament  approved  the  first  material  change  to  the  CEFC  Act,
expanding the role of the CEFC in driving investment towards the achievement of Australia's net zero
ambitions. In parallel, the Government made the first increase in the organisation's capital allocation
since 2012, empowering the CEFC to drive investment across priority areas critical to the clean energy
transition  with  an  additional  capital  allocation  of  $20.5  billion.[13]  After  10  years  of  investment,  in
2022 CEFC surpassed lifetime investment commitments of A$10 billion. Minister for Climate Change
and Energy Chris Bowen, described the CEFC as ""the proud legacy of Labor in government"" and said
it would be essential in order to achieve of Australia's net zero emissions ambitions.[14]

Chairman  Steven  Skala  noted  in  a  2022  address  at  Parliament  House,  Canberra  that  the  CEFC
enjoyed  political  support,  observing  that  the  cornerstone  of  a  strong  economy  was  stable  and
affordable energy.[15]

Legislative requirements

The  Clean  Energy  Finance  Corporation  Act  2012  establishes  the  CEFC,  sets  out  the  organisation’s
purpose and functions, and establishes arrangements for the Board, CEO and staff. Under the CEFC
Act, the Australian Government can provide directions to the CEFC by issuing it with an investment
mandate on matters set out in the Act. The CEFC Board is consulted in a process set out in the Act.
Directions contained in the Investment Mandate must be consistent with the CEFC Act.[16]

The  CEFC  is  a  corporate  Commonwealth  entity  under  the  Public  Governance,  Performance  and
Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act).[17]

Investment mandates

A  series  of  Clean  Energy  Finance  Corporation  Investment  Mandate  Direction  have  been  legislated
since 2013,[18] the latest as of March 2024 being the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Investment
Mandate Direction 2023, enacted on 21 July 2023. This provides direction on the $19 billion Rewiring
the  Nation  Fund,  the  $1  billion  Household  Energy  Upgrades  Fund,  and  the  $500  million  Powering
Australia  Technology  Fund,  all  of  which  were  created  in  2023.  The  Mandate  also  provides  for  the
continuation of the Advancing Hydrogen Fund and the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. The Mandate

also adjusts the CEFC Portfolio Benchmark rate of Return (PBR) for the CEFC General Portfolio to an
average of 2-3 per cent above the five-year government bond rate per annum over the medium to long
term, down from 3-4 per cent previously stipulated.[19]

Governance

As of March 2024 Steven Skala is chair,[20] and Ian Learmonth is CEO of CEFC.[21]

Mission and aims

Operating  as  a  green  bank,  the  government-owned  financial  institution  invests  in  clean  energy,
alongside  private  investors,  innovators  and  industry  leaders,  in  the  clean  energy  sector,  to  help
achieve Australia's national goal of net zero emissions by 2050.[22]

As  of  2023  the  CEFC  is  responsible  for  investing  more  than  $30  billion  on  behalf  of  the  Australian
Government in economy-wide decarbonisation opportunities, including renewable energy and natural
capital  to  energy  efficiency,  alternative  fuels  and  low  carbon  materials.  It  is  also  focused  on
transforming  the  Australian  energy  grid,  backing  sustainable  housing  and  supporting  the  growth  of
climate tech innovators.[23]

Investment strategy

The CEFC works with businesses, institutional investors, and entrepreneurs to increase investment in
Australia’s transition to net zero emissions. The CEFC is mandated by law to anticipate and respond
to  the  environment  and  market  conditions  in  which  it  operates,  which  may  include  increasing  its
investment activities to fill market gaps where the private sector is absent.[24] It is obliged to operate
in  a  way  that  delivers  a  positive  return  for  taxpayers  across  its  portfolio,  and  publishes  quarterly
reports on its website about its investment commitments.[25]

Investment performance

The  CEFC  completed  30  new  and  20  follow-on  transactions  in  the  2022-23  year,  confirming  $1.9
billion in new investment commitments. Its total transaction value was $11.7 billion, which included a
record $1.2 billion in renewable energy and grid-related commitments. The lifetime total transaction
value reached $48.8 billion. As of 30 June 2023, the CEFC portfolio of on-risk investments was $7.7
billion. The CEFC also invested a record $54.5 million in new and ongoing commitments via the Clean
Energy  Innovation  Fund.  Each  dollar  of  Innovation  Fund  capital  attracted  an  additional  $6.47  in
private sector capital in the 2022-23 year, delivering a combined $407.3 million to emerging climate
tech businesses.[26]

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has opened the  rst

phase of the AUD 1 billion Solar Sunshot program aimed at advancing PV

manufacturing innovation in Australia and creating a more resilient

renewable energy supply chain.

ARENA Chief Executive O icer Darren Miller said the Solar Sunshot

program o ers production subsidies and grants to Australian businesses

and aims to uncover and support innovation to drive scale and diversity in

a critical industry.

“Solar electricity will be the foundation of Australia’s future energy supply

and the key to our net zero and renewable energy superpower ambitions,”

he said. “We need to build on our history of innovation and extend this

into manufacturing across the solar supply chain. The demand for solar

required to meet our net zero and renewable energy superpower goals is

immense and Australia has the opportunity to build resilience and unlock

long-term economic opportunity.”

The  rst AUD 550 million will support the commercialiuation of Australian

PV innovations and scale up the manufacturing of Australian solar panels.

This will include AUD 500 million in Round 1A to support solar panel

manufacturing in Australia, with a focus on modules, inputs to modules,

including solar glass and frames, and deployment systems like racking.

Round 1B will comprise AUD 50 million to fund solar panel manufacturing

studies, including feasibility and engineering studies.

Australian Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the Solar Sunshot

program will let Australian technology, innovation, know-how, and skills

compete against international players. He noted that only about 1% of the

solar panels installed in Australia are manufactured domestically.

“That’s why bringing solar manufacturing to our shores is so critical for

unlocking our future as a renewable energy superpower and securing the

job of the future,” he said. “Diverse, secure and resilient supply chains,

supported by more onshore manufacturing across more of the value chain,

are too important to our security and success to leave to hope. Now is the

time to take advantage of some of the best solar resources and renewable

energy expertise in the world.”

Heidi Lee, chief executive of independent think tank Beyond Zero

Emissions (BZE), said the Solar Sunshot initiative marks a signi cant step

toward building a robust and sustainable domestic solar industry, but

claimed that more needs to be done.

Lee said local content incentives within government contracts and

schemes are needed to provide demand certainty for Australian-made

clean tech, and to keep more of the bene ts of the initiative circulating in

our communities.

“China makes the lion’s share of the solar panels which go onto Australian

rooftops, and we can instead manufacture these parts and panels in

regions such as the Hunter, the Latrobe Valley, Illawarra and Central

Queensland,” she said. “These are all regions BZE has suggested can host

renewables-powered industrial and manufacturing hubs. These clean

industry hubs are the best investment locations for new manufacturing

facilities with existing infrastructure, transport logistics and skilled

workforces.”

The International Energy Agency estimates 1.300 manufacturing jobs for

each GW of solar PV production.

Applications for the  rst round of funding are now being taken with

ARENA saying proposals will be assessed against merit criteria on an

individual basis.  Applications for Round 1A are due by April 30, 2025.

while applications for Round 1B are to close on Nov. 12, 2025.

Future funding rounds under the Solar Sunshot program are expected to

be announced from mid-2025.

CEFC confirms record renewables
investment as race to net zero gathers
momentum

CEFC Investment Update: 2022-23 

21 August 2023 

The CEFC has confirmed $1.9 billion in new investment commitments in the 2022-23 year, including a record $1.2 billion in renewable energy and grid-
related investment commitments by Australia’s ‘green bank’, delivered despite challenging market conditions.  

CEO Ian Learmonth said: “In making a record $1.2 billion in renewables investment commitments in the 2022-23 year, we have worked with investors and
project developers to help bring forward 14 large-scale solar, wind and storage projects with a total transaction value of $5.7 billion.  

Investment of this scale is critical to our national goal of reaching 82 per cent renewables by 2030. With Australia’s renewables sector responding to
complex global economic and supply chain pressures, we have confirmed our important role in using our capital to fill market gaps in the face of a
difficult market for investors and developers.

Ian Learmonth
CEO, CEFC

Investment Update 2022-23 

In its Investment Update 2022-231, the CEFC completed 30 new and 20 follow-on transactions in the 12 months to 30 June 2023, committing an additional
$1.9 billion to transactions with a total value of $11.7 billion. Lifetime CEFC commitments reached $12.7 billion across more than 300 large-scale
transactions, taking lifetime total transaction value to $48.8 billion, with Australia’s ‘green bank’ driving public and private investment in net zero
ambitions.  

Significantly, private sector leverage for CEFC investment commitments in the 2022-23 year reached an all-time high, with each $1 of CEFC capital
attracting an additional $5.02 in private sector capital. This strong leverage reflects CEFC investments in large-scale transformational investments,
including a $100 million commitment to the NSW Waratah Super Battery, one of the largest standby network batteries in the world. The CEFC also made
its single largest investment in a wind project, committing up to $222.5 million to Victoria’s 756 MW Golden Plains Wind Farm.  

The CEFC also invested a record $54.5 million in new and follow on commitments via the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which is managed by fund
manager Virescent Ventures. Each $1 of Innovation Fund capital attracted an additional $6.47 in private sector capital in the 2022-23 year, delivering a
combined $407.3 million to emerging cleantech businesses.  

Renewables and grid 

CEFC investments in large-scale renewables and transmission-related projects since inception have contributed to transactions with a total value of $18.8
billion at 30 June 2023.  

Mr Learmonth said the 2022-23 year had been characterised by supply chain shortages and grid constraints for the renewables sector, with the CEFC
working closely with investors and project proponents to deliver a continued flow of capital to eligible projects.  

He added: “This has included responding to market headwinds in capex, interest rates and foreign exchange, with our capital accelerating project
delivery and underpinning offtake agreements to aid proponents in navigating challenging market conditions. Our finance is also backing larger
projects, in terms of capital and generation capacity, a positive signal of investor and developer appetite in the required large-scale investments.  

“These investments have occurred alongside important early work on the Rewiring the Nation program, laying the foundation for critical grid investments
to unlock additional renewable generation in identified locations. On the back of strong investment in 2022-23, we are looking forward to announcing our
first Rewiring the Nation investment transactions.”  

Economy-wide benefits and opportunities 

Mr Learmonth said the CEFC was seeing the national ambition to deliver net zero emissions by 2050 adopted by an increasing number of participants
across the economy, particularly in managing energy demand. 

“A defining feature of the net zero transition is the flow on economic benefits, in terms of new investment in infrastructure, property and natural capital,
alongside the development of new energy sources, such as hydrogen and alternative fuels,” he said. “These trends are in evidence across CEFC
transactions in 2022-23, where Australian and international capital is underpinning economic and sustainability gains in diverse areas of our economy.  

“CEFC finance is driving greater ambition at the asset owner level across multiple sectors, including exciting mid-market infrastructure and
infrastructure-like businesses in areas from healthcare and energy to transport and data centres. Notable examples include our $50 million investment in
a new sustainable agricultural platform with Canadian investors CDPQ and a $20 million commitment to innovative car leasing company Splend to help
convert the rideshare market to electric vehicles.” 

Investment approach 

Mr Learmonth said the CEFC maintained a rigorous approach to its investment decisions, reflecting its commitment to deliver a positive return across its
portfolio. Capital returned to the CEFC in 2022-23 was $1.2 billion, taking lifetime repayments and returns to more than $4.5 billion. At 30 June 2023, the
CEFC portfolio of on-risk investments was $7.7 billion. 

“We are pleased to report repayments and refinancings have averaged close to $1 billion for each of the past four years, reflecting the strength of the
CEFC model,” he said. “This demonstrates the crowding in of private sector banks and investors allowing us to continue to reinvest capital from our
original $10 billion allocation, alongside new commitments drawing on the additional $20.5 billion allocation announced in the reporting year.” 

CEFC role substantially expanded 

The 2022-23 year saw important developments for the CEFC at the start of its second decade, with an amendment to the CEFC Act extending the object
of the CEFC to include a specific reference “to facilitate the achievement of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets”.  

The Australian Government also approved an additional $20.5 billion capital allocation to the CEFC, the first increase since the CEFC was established in
2012. The new capital includes $19 billion to transform the Australian energy transmission grid through Rewiring the Nation, $1 billion to help householders
reshape their energy use, and $500 million to back the ongoing growth and development of projects and companies in the climate tech sector. The
CEFC expects to make investments drawing on the additional capital allocation from the 2023-24 year. 

Mr Learmonth said: “The CEFC was established to drive investment in our clean energy transition, reflecting the essential role of both public and private
sector capital in cutting emissions across our economy.  

“Working alongside co-investors, we have seen our initial $10 billion capital allocation deliver almost $50 billion in total transaction value. We are proud of
the positive economic impact of these investments, as well as their contribution to the urgent task of lowering our emissions.  

“The recent increase in our capital allocation to $30.5 billion substantially expands the role of the CEFC as Australia’s ‘green bank’. We begin our second
decade with a clear focus on driving new investment through the Rewiring the Nation program, the new Household Energy Upgrades Fund and Powering
Australia Technology Fund, alongside our ongoing core businesses.”
