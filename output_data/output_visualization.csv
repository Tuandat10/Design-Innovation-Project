The Haber-Bosch process is arguably the most important industrial process ever developed (used primarily for the production of fertilizer) and it relies on hydrogen that currently comes from natural gas at a huge carbon cost. And even when it is an electricity alternative, it has an energy density 175x that of li-ion cells. Yes, batteries won the 'format war' for cars, but ships? airplanes? Hydrogen will be important there because of that energy density unless there's some miracle battery breakthrough which seems unlikely. As for cost, green hydrogen is expensive now... but that's largely because it's not produced at scale because there's no demand yet. It also looks like hydrogen is poised to be the dominant 'power-to-X' commodity. In a fully renewable world, there will be lots of curtailment. If electric demand is low, and the wind is blowing, you can either shut your wind turbine off, or use the excess power to make 'free' hydrogen.

I'm an electrical power engineer, clean energy accredited designer, and have more than a passing interest in the stuff. We absolutely 100% need green hydrogen.... BUT... Hydrogen hopium is strong but the physics aren't as enthusiastic as the fossil fuel industry backers of it. Without a doubt green hydrogen has a part to play in a zero emission future, but in my estimations it's future will be limited to using it as a molecule and NOT an energy source or fuel. Green Steel may fit into the former. What I mean by that is we will need green hydrogen to replace the approximately 100 million tons of fossil-derived hydrogen that we currently use in the world, for things like making ammonia for fertiliser, and syngas etc. We absolutely must displace these with green hydrogen but it doesn't account for a huge amount of the world's overall emissions so we need to focus on the big pieces of low hanging fruit first, as we have finite resources, finite money, and not much time to keep kicking the can. Hydrogen is NOT a source of energy. It is a STORE of energy. So you have to make hydrogen from something. You can either reform methane (natural gas) using steam (""black"" or ""blue"" hydrogen), or you can use renewable electricity and water to make ""green"" hydrogen. You can burn the hydrogen for heat energy, or you can run it through a fuel cell to turn it back into electricity. The latter being the most commonly pushed technology. This is an awfully inefficient process. You have to convert electricity into hydrogen gas, compress it to a liquid, transport it, store it, then turn it back into electricity. You lose around two-thirds of the original energy context of the renewable electricity. Its also expensive. As a practical example, what this means is a Tesla 3 BEV is 3 to 4 times more energy efficient, and costs around 5 times less to ""fuel"" per km, than a Toyota Mirai HFCV. This approximate benchmark applies to most other applications where people are pushing green hydrogen as a solution to green energy. If we use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries, we will need to generate THREE TIMES as much renewable electricity. This is not small beans. Look at who is backing most of the big hydrogen projects worldwide. Its largely fossil fuel companies. If they were doing it with their own capital I wouldn't care, but they're all seeking public money to do it. Forgive me for being cynical, but it seems like one big bait & switch scheme - sell us the sizzle of green hydrogen, but actually sell us black or blue hydrogen. If it looks like a duck... TLDR: we need to directly electrify whatever we can as quickly as we can, and at the same time building out our grid with solar, wind & hydro. I would say nuclear but I don't think we have time and it's too expensive. But I remain open to the possibility. We need green hydrogen but we need it to replace the existing dirty hydrogen.

Hydrogen storage has a parasitic relationship to energy we have already made. For example, hydrogen NEEDS energy in order to produce hydrogen. Once that energy is made, hydrogen needs a huge amount of that energy and then less than half of it coverts into usable energy. You need specialized equipment to make hydrogen. It is expensive. You have to be trained on how to operate it. You need a large facility. You need special permits to produce it. You need special permits to store it. You special equipment to store it. It must be stored at very cold temperatures. This costs money and energy. It must be stored in specialized equipment. Over time, the actual hydrogen itself breaks down the equipment. This is called EMBRITTLEMENT. Up to this point in the process, you have lost almost 30% of all the hydrogen you have just made. Hydrogen is really small. So it escapes into our environment, even with our best-known equipment ever made. Letâ€™s say you have a buyerâ€¦ you need a special license to sell it. Expensive!! The buyer will be charged for you to deliver it to them. (This is passed on to whomever they sell it to) And whoever buys it, needs specialized equipment to keep it cold and to not let it escape.

The requirement to fill this edge case comes after the other options along the continuum of grid storage technologies towards 'expensive box that's cheap to fill' are used (batteries are a good example here).

If we're talking purely economic terms, then of course renewables have an advantage over nuclear, but I dont get why everyone here discusses this as if they're an econ major without highlighting we do a tonne of things that is not economically rational, we build car dependent sprawls and toll roads instead of medium and higher density housing and improving public transport, we do everything possible to inflate our speculative housing bubble, we keep coal plants running far longer than necessary to keep jobs, we buy nuclear subs when diesel electric will suffice etc. Not saying nuclear is the right approach but I do worry about the impending climate catastrophe, i dont believe it should be nuclear or renewables, I think both have their parts to play when it comes to switching away from fossil fuels.",Infrastructure,Australia,Nuclear Energy

899,Very Positive,4.8936,"The reasons for powering submarines with nuclear power are due to operational needs. The point is to be able to have the submarine stay hidden underwater for a very long time. Other power sources can't do that. Diesel electric subs can only stay under for a couple of weeks before having to come up for air. Whether that is a necessary expense or not is a different question, but there is a specific need for that type of power source for that type of application. We don't need power for the Australian grid to be able to be generated underwater for 4 months in a row. So it doesn't make sense to invest a huge amount of time and money in investing in nuclear energy when we can get more energy and quicker by investing in renewables. The idea of wasting a lot of money to build nuclear power plants in order to develop a domestic pool of talent to manage nuclear power plants doesn't make sense, if we didn't need the nuclear power plants in the first place. If you want to waste money on developing skills we don't need, then how about we replace a portion of our digital phone switchboards with manual ones, and then train a pool of talent as phone switchboard operators so that we have that skill handy to operate the unnecessary manual phone switchboards that we installed just so we could have a pool of talent to operate them.",Infrastructure,Australia,Nuclear Energy

That short term being defined by both needing to reduce carbon output and the end of life of existing coal & gas systems. Firstly there is no international capability to produce reactors in bulk or in any form of modular way. Every reactor is designed and built to custom spec. The net outcome of this is that individual power stations are expensive and slow to build. In comparison you can buy off the shelf coal furnaces, boilers and turbines and then just assemble them. If you look at reactors built recently in the western world the time scales of those builds are eye watering. The Vogtle power station is the latest reactor to come online in the US. This was an expansion of an existing plant, so much of the infrastructure was already in place, and yet it took 11 years from the start of construction to commissioning. The second is that we don't have the domestic skillset to build and operate the plants effectively. We have the capacity to learn those skills, but it is a workforce we don't have. This will add into the time to build, and the mistakes that will be made in the build that will need significant rectification. So if you said ""GO!"" right now, I genuinely believe we would be looking at 15 years before the first plant would be online. By which a vast number of our coal plants would have collapsed, and we would have had to build other solutions to keep things running anyway.

(There were a few options at the time in terms of sustainable projects and residential rooftop solar was picked as the one which would have the most enduring impact). The WA state government provided a pretty sizeable rebate on solar panels, and then also the feed-in tariff was huge. It was a massive cost to the government, but it was done deliberately to create a market for solar and drive down the prices over time. It was incredibly successful, and as the goal was met, the feed-in tariffs were reduced more and more.

We're a house of 4, with ""high"" energy usage, WFH, ducted AC and an EV. The EV uses about 250kwh a month - or about $15 to charge from solar for a month! There are some other considerations too, like our hot water runs on another circuit at night so can't currently take advantage of solar, so a few more things to be done to improve our usage. Cooking and AC at night are still our main usages.",Cost,Australia,Solar Energy
1187,Very Positive,4.5928,"Ours started in 2015 and simple cash back six and a bit years later. It cost $6700 for 4.2 kW and we saved around $1100 per year. I kept a detailed spreadsheet and learned a few lessons. You have to use $ per per-kW usage rate, not your average (e.g. $ paid divided by kWh used) because the daily service charge doesn't change. You use less electricity, so the price per kW for purchased electricity goes up a little, again, because of the service charge. Expected behaviour change because of being more aware of your consumption? Lucky dip. Some people use more total power because they reckon cheaper now, I'll take the comfort. As far as the economics, I used solarquotes.com.au and nothing on that website turned out to be incorrect, including the various calculators there. His output calculator matched at around 96% of what we're actually getting across multiple years. That impressed me. There's lots there and he's started to cover electric cars as well. With hindsight, you could say our system should have been bigger, but it was based on likely usage. It was based on our usage figures which was best practice at the time. Nowadays, provided you get approval for your area, maximise use of roof space, and I wouldn't put up less than 6.6 kW for a 4-bedroom house. Otherwise our system has been worry-free zero-maintenance, up until a couple months ago. Our system has been topping out at 2.5 kW lately. In past years I would see 3.3, 3.4 on good days, occasionally even 3.5. Called the company and they said $330 for a tech visit and assessment. We'll see how it goes. Panels are clean so it's not that. Hoping for a nest under one of them causing a hot spot or something else easy to fix. One bad panel could be doing it, and that could be disconnected. Hail damage? We've had the worst of hail (6cm) totaling cars on our road and didn't cause any issue for the panels, years ago. Inverter should last 12 years, and it's only 8, but ya never know, maybe it's a dud.

If you have a smart meter you should be able to see your usage by the hour or half hour on line (depending on your biller). So you can see your own family's specific usage by time of day. My biggest winter users are the ducted aircon - set to heat from 5am to 7am every day. Followed by cooking the main evening meal - 4.30'ish to 6.30'ish (oven being the biggest user) - and the dishwasher 8pm every night (after the peak time period). Sure I could use the dishwasher when the solar power is being generated but TBH I would find that pretty inconvenient. So the 3 biggest winter power consumers in my house are used when there is no solar generation - so solar would not benefit me at all for the Big 3 - unless I had a battery - which there is no way I could afford. The same Big 3 for summer usage - the aircon - cooling at various times depending on the temperature, by far the biggest summer user. And yes - there would be an opportunity to use some solar generated power for the aircon. But most days there is no way we could turn off the aircon when the panels stop generating solar power and expect our home to stay cool for hours after that so we could sleep in a cool house - as I have seen in some comments - our house would heat up again in no time! And yes we have roof insulation - and have draught proofed our home etc. Our main cooking would still be 4.30 to 6.30'ish and dishwasher 8pm - both when no solar power would be generated. Note: I have LPG instant HWS - which will probably be replaced with electric when it dies. My cooktop is one gas ring (used infrequently) and 2 induction . I thoroughly researched solar about 4 months ago. Our roof space is not large - and we do not have the space for a vast array of panels to be installed. We were being quoted on 6.6 'ish systems. All the salesman's cost benefit analysis were based on some type of average usage, not truly specific to when I actually use the most power. When I did my own analysis using my specific usage times my results were very different to what the salesmen were telling me! I decided against solar - could not justify the expense for such a small system (without storage) at my age. The feed in tariff is low and will only go lower. Plus there is a real risk that my single level home will be in the shadow of a high rise within the next 5-10 years.

Panels are well worth it (around 15% to 20% internal rate of return) unless you have serious shading issues. Domestic storage batteries do not yet have a positive return. There are more options today, such as switching water heating to daytime only (provided tank is large enough), so as to consume more of your own power. Domestic water heating is the most cost-effective form of surplus energy storage from solar panels. Some installers will upscale to include battery and show a positive return. It will be less than panels alone, essentially using the great return on panels to make the battery look good. They'll emphasise that being away during the day you must have battery. All flat-out crap to make a bigger sale. Don't fall for it. You'll probably use the timers on your appliances to run dishwasher and laundry when you're out. Your aircon likely also has a timer, so you can turn it on before you get home. Plus hot water as mentioned. Other options open up but may be too much bother.

Effectively, they point out that nuclear can be built cheapely and economically. The US model of building nuclear with a private industry is not viable.

A new government run large infrastructure entity is not acceptable to the Liberal party. Or they will sell it at a discount as soon as practical.

So, with LESS than the total cost, coal is still more expensive. We wont know the ""exact"" cost to humanity of CO2 emissions until its too late. There is actually a section of legislation in Australian state laws called the Precautionary Principle, which basically says: in situations of uncertain impacts, we must act with what we DO know to prevent as much environmental damage as possible, rather than waiting around indefinitely for better info (while everything goes to shit). From what is known about fossil fuels and wind power, environmental damage costs in the long term for FF are much greater than wind. Also, on this ""cheap (fossil fuel) energy"" argument: the world will run out of cheap (in the short term costings) fossil fuel energy, so alternatives must be introduced to enable a transnational period. A gradual transition is needed for predictable energy prices, predictable prices encourages economic investment(lower risk investment), which leads to growth and jobs etc. Switching suddenly to another energy generation method when we run out of fossil fuels requires shittonnes of research and development and investment in unproven things etc which causes economic instability(high risk investment) which discourages investment.
