80,Australia,FMAA,"A large group of economists has backed the federal government’s Future Made in Australia policy, accusing critics of consigning the country to an “extract and export” business model while ignoring the potential for hundreds of thousands of well-paying industrial jobs. The economists and policy experts, from institutions including the universities of Sydney, Melbourne, NSW, Monash, Western Australia and Newcastle, have signed an open letter declaring Anthony Albanese’s $23 billion budget plan represents a chance to rebuild the manufacturing sector and support regional jobs while slashing greenhouse gas emissions. In last month’s federal budget, the government unveiled a suite of measures, including production credits to support the development of critical minerals and green hydrogen, plus direct investment in quantum computing. Key elements of the policy have been criticised by some economists, including the Productivity Commission, as a possible waste of money due to the government in effect “picking winners”. But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation’s economic development. Loading Accusing the Productivity Commission and other critics of knee-jerk responses predicated on “outdated laissez-faire thinking”, the economists say the world of economic statecraft is changing rapidly, which threatens to leave Australia behind. “Australia faces a vital choice. Decades of policy neglect for manufacturing, combined with support (including subsidies) for mineral extraction and export, have left Australia with a distorted and unbalanced economy,” they wrote. “Among all OECD nations, Australia has the smallest manufacturing base (relative to overall GDP and employment) and is most reliant on net imports of manufactures to meet its own growing needs for manufactured products. “This exposes Australia to a wide range of economic, social, environmental and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, powerful corporate interests keep pressuring to extend and expand their extract and export business model.” Among those to sign the letter are the University of Sydney’s Lynne Chester and Bradon Ellem, Monash University’s Svenja Keele and Nick McGuigan, the University of NSW’s Bronwen Morgan and Elizabeth Thurbon, and Australian National University’s John Falzon. In the budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the Future Made in Australia package would help the country become an “indispensable” part of the global economy by attracting investment in key industries and making the nation an energy superpower. The Coalition has attacked the production credits aspect of the package, which offers up to $7 billion of tax support for the processing and refining of critical minerals, describing them as “billions to billionaires”. Several high-profile economists, including long-time independent analyst Chris Richardson, have raised concerns the program will in effect amount to smoking “$100 notes”. But one of the organisers of the letter, the chair of discipline for political economy at Sydney University, Gareth Bryant, said it was important to show there was support for a policy that recognised the changed global economic environment. “We decided to organise this letter to put on record our support for Australia joining the emerging global consensus around the need for governments to actively drive and steer the green transformation of our economy,” he said. “We support the Future Made in Australia agenda as an important step in this direction, but we also want to push the government to make sure it is getting a return on its investments for workers, regions, and the environment, rather than handing out a blank cheque to the private sector.” The economists said Australia had become overly dependent on raw resources that had diverted labour and investment into one small area that led to an overvalued Australian dollar, distorted fiscal policy and added to regional imbalances. They said Australia, without a policy such as that proposed by the federal government, risked missing a “historic opportunity” to rebuild the economy. “We could continue exporting raw minerals (including critical minerals like lithium). But we would squander opportunities to add value to those minerals and develop a more diversified and sustainable industrial mix,” they said. “We would remain on the losing end of lopsided trade relations, selling unprocessed resources to buy back more expensive value-added products (like transmission equipment, batteries and electric vehicles). “Our future prosperity would be jeopardised by failure to seize the economic and industrial opportunities of the global energy transition.”",4.9304,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost, Infrastructure"

199,Australia,HHS,"I'll start with a throat-clearing so I am not accused of being a nay-sayer or a hater of hydrogen. I'm an electrical power engineer, clean energy accredited designer, and have more than a passing interest in the stuff. We absolutely 100% need green hydrogen.... BUT... Hydrogen hopium is strong but the physics aren't as enthusiastic as the fossil fuel industry backers of it. Without a doubt green hydrogen has a part to play in a zero emission future, but in my estimations it's future will be limited to using it as a molecule and NOT an energy source or fuel. Green Steel may fit into the former. What I mean by that is we will need green hydrogen to replace the approximately 100 million tons of fossil-derived hydrogen that we currently use in the world, for things like making ammonia for fertiliser, and syngas etc. We absolutely must displace these with green hydrogen but it doesn't account for a huge amount of the world's overall emissions so we need to focus on the big pieces of low hanging fruit first, as we have finite resources, finite money, and not much time to keep kicking the can. Hydrogen is NOT a source of energy. It is a STORE of energy. So you have to make hydrogen from something. You can either reform methane (natural gas) using steam (""black"" or ""blue"" hydrogen), or you can use renewable electricity and water to make ""green"" hydrogen. You can burn the hydrogen for heat energy, or you can run it through a fuel cell to turn it back into electricity. The latter being the most commonly pushed technology. This is an awfully inefficient process. You have to convert electricity into hydrogen gas, compress it to a liquid, transport it, store it, then turn it back into electricity. You lose around two-thirds of the original energy context of the renewable electricity. Its also expensive. As a practical example, what this means is a Tesla 3 BEV is 3 to 4 times more energy efficient, and costs around 5 times less to ""fuel"" per km, than a Toyota Mirai HFCV. This approximate benchmark applies to most other applications where people are pushing green hydrogen as a solution to green energy. If we use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries, we will need to generate THREE TIMES as much renewable electricity. This is not small beans. Look at who is backing most of the big hydrogen projects worldwide. Its largely fossil fuel companies. If they were doing it with their own capital I wouldn't care, but they're all seeking public money to do it. Forgive me for being cynical, but it seems like one big bait & switch scheme - sell us the sizzle of green hydrogen, but actually sell us black or blue hydrogen. If it looks like a duck... TLDR: we need to directly electrify whatever we can as quickly as we can, and at the same time building out our grid with solar, wind & hydro. I would say nuclear but I don't think we have time and it's too expensive. But I remain open to the possibility. We need green hydrogen but we need it to replace the existing dirty hydrogen.

The resulting hydrogen is basically free (What else you gonna do with the excess? really, what else could you reasonably do on demand at any time?) Hydrogen is useful as you can; A) Store it for winter energy B) Combine it with nitrogen (Air is mostly nitrogen) = Ammonia Ammonia is an industrial feedstock for many profitable things like making fertiliser, bombs, etc We already handle, store, process large amounts of ammonia, it's fairly stable, can be liquified and transported easily, procedures, policies already exist, CSIRO came up with cool membrane which if you push Ammonia through splits it back into Hydrogen and Nitrogen Ammonia is cool C) Use the Hydrogen in other Industrial process, namely Steel making  Hydrogen is a waste by-product of renewable energy.

220,Australia,HHS,"There are 2 main elements to energy, electricity and other forms of energy, and each of those is split into domestic and commercial applications. Hydrogen is more associated with commercial applications and is less a renewable energy form, but a store of energy derived from renewable energy sources. But herein lies the dilemma in renewable energy in that its manufacture rate is limited and thus we have to choose whether more of it goes into domestic supply or commercial utilisation. The problem arises if more goes into commercial usage and less into domestic as domestic is largely fed by electricity and that can only be generated by renewable sources or fossil fuel power stations. If we close fossil fuel power stations down asynchronously with demand, there will be blackouts and with less renewable energy allocated to domestic demand, the possibility of blackouts increases; whilst commercial applications will simply continue to use fossil fuels if green hydrogen isn't available, which only impacts on emissions and not their ability to keep operating. Essentially, domestic and commercial demand are competing for a limited quantity of renewable energy production, when domestic demand potentially suffers more from loss of supply than commercial. Green Hydrogen development potentially siphons off more of that renewable demand, leaving less for domestic supply of electricity. The Australian government would do better to invest in more renewable energy on top of investment in green Hydrogen and the best way to do this would be to directly invest in an accelerated implementation of solar panels and batteries on domestic and commercial properties, that can best make use of the energy available and reduce losses by better co-locating generation and consumption, whilst also not requiring additional investment in transmission and distribution systems. It may not be practical to replace domestic gas consumption with hydrogen because of containment issues with existing infrastructure, however, perhaps government could consider development of renewable energy to be used to convert carbon emissions into ""natural"" gas to replace mined natural gas, thus leading to a net zero carbon cycle and not requiring replacement of existing gas energy infrastructure with its attendant energy consumption in the manufacture of replacement electrical infrastructure. It seems a waste to dispose of the energy embodied in existing gas infrastructure merely to replace it with electrical equipment (as it also does in the replacement of ICEV with EV). I think we have to be careful we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater in our eagerness to replace fossil fuel energy with renewable energy.",4.9404,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost, Infrastructure"
221,Australia,HHS,"Acknowledging that it is a huge infrastructure spend, we should be going straight to domestic electrification. As you note, it is unlikely we can use hydrogen directly for domestic heating and cooking without a similarly large investment in infrastructure, and blending a tiny fraction of hydrogen into our existing natural gas networks isn't going to make much of a difference. More crucially, the pathway Electrical generation ? Hydrogen ? Domestic heating is very inefficient when compared with using that electrical power directly for cooking or with heat pumps for heating. Hydrogen is not great for grid storage because again, it's really inefficient when compared with pumped hydro (if you have some handy mountains, which we do) or admittedly still immature options such as redox flow batteries. Using the hydrogen to make methane (or ammonia, or methanol, ...) is an option, but still terrible for grid storage and still inefficient for domestic heating.

So much for the theory. The reality is that the electrolyzers built now, need to run 100% of the time to become 'profitable', which is still at way higher prices than natural-gas based H2. With this application, H2 production will be consuming much needed electricity for heat pumps, electric cars and other assets much needed to replace fossil-fuel based solutions.

Arguably at small scale trying to find a fuel cell large enough to augment my home inverter, and keep a larger amount of stored energy over days, and not a day like my lithium battery. What I found at least at small scale was: The really efficient (95%) electrolysers like Hysata are not available to average consumers yet. I could not find anyone that could even cost a decent fuel cell for me. They are rare at the smaller scale. There are really promising methods for storing hydrogen in fixed applications like metal hydrides, which are heavy, but really efficient, safe, and low pressure with low explosive risk. These are not readily available for consumers though, and very expensive still. Fuel cells still have a way to go in efficiency (<50%) but my use case didn't really care (using my excess solar capacity that would go to waste). My hope was to be able to store a week worth of energy at a fraction of the cost (the fuel cell stays the same size, and you just add tanks). Didn't pan out though, and I think we are a way off still before it becomes more popular. The question is whether it will always be behind battery tech tho? Sodium ion batteries... flow batteries... all of these technologies may actually mature and bring cost down quicker than fuel cells, especially because they are very low complexity (no pipes or compressors).

328,Australia,Hydro Power,"I'll start with a throat-clearing so I am not accused of being a nay-sayer or a hater of hydrogen. I'm an electrical power engineer, clean energy accredited designer, and have more than a passing interest in the stuff. We absolutely 100% need green hydrogen.... BUT... Hydrogen hopium is strong but the physics aren't as enthusiastic as the fossil fuel industry backers of it. Without a doubt green hydrogen has a part to play in a zero emission future, but in my estimations it's future will be limited to using it as a molecule and NOT an energy source or fuel. Green Steel may fit into the former. What I mean by that is we will need green hydrogen to replace the approximately 100 million tons of fossil-derived hydrogen that we currently use in the world, for things like making ammonia for fertiliser, and syngas etc. We absolutely must displace these with green hydrogen but it doesn't account for a huge amount of the world's overall emissions so we need to focus on the big pieces of low hanging fruit first, as we have finite resources, finite money, and not much time to keep kicking the can. Hydrogen is NOT a source of energy. It is a STORE of energy. So you have to make hydrogen from something. You can either reform methane (natural gas) using steam (""black"" or ""blue"" hydrogen), or you can use renewable electricity and water to make ""green"" hydrogen. You can burn the hydrogen for heat energy, or you can run it through a fuel cell to turn it back into electricity. The latter being the most commonly pushed technology. This is an awfully inefficient process. You have to convert electricity into hydrogen gas, compress it to a liquid, transport it, store it, then turn it back into electricity. You lose around two-thirds of the original energy context of the renewable electricity. Its also expensive. As a practical example, what this means is a Tesla 3 BEV is 3 to 4 times more energy efficient, and costs around 5 times less to ""fuel"" per km, than a Toyota Mirai HFCV. This approximate benchmark applies to most other applications where people are pushing green hydrogen as a solution to green energy. If we use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries, we will need to generate THREE TIMES as much renewable electricity. This is not small beans. Look at who is backing most of the big hydrogen projects worldwide. Its largely fossil fuel companies. If they were doing it with their own capital I wouldn't care, but they're all seeking public money to do it. Forgive me for being cynical, but it seems like one big bait & switch scheme - sell us the sizzle of green hydrogen, but actually sell us black or blue hydrogen. If it looks like a duck... TLDR: we need to directly electrify whatever we can as quickly as we can, and at the same time building out our grid with solar, wind & hydro. I would say nuclear but I don't think we have time and it's too expensive. But I remain open to the possibility. We need green hydrogen but we need it to replace the existing dirty hydrogen.

The resulting hydrogen is basically free (What else you gonna do with the excess? really, what else could you reasonably do on demand at any time?) Hydrogen is useful as you can; A) Store it for winter energy B) Combine it with nitrogen (Air is mostly nitrogen) = Ammonia Ammonia is an industrial feedstock for many profitable things like making fertiliser, bombs, etc We already handle, store, process large amounts of ammonia, it's fairly stable, can be liquified and transported easily, procedures, policies already exist, CSIRO came up with cool membrane which if you push Ammonia through splits it back into Hydrogen and Nitrogen Ammonia is cool C) Use the Hydrogen in other Industrial process, namely Steel making  Hydrogen is a waste by-product of renewable energy.

It still leaks. And it still explodes. Australia has no local advantage in its production (green hydrogen) because all it needs is power and water. Every country has access to power and water.

382,Australia,Hydro Power,"OP u/Aquatic-Enigma, Hydrogen storage is extremely inefficient. In this new age of efficiency competition for basically anything, no one wants to go backwards! Hydrogen storage has a parasitic relationship to energy we have already made. For example, hydrogen NEEDS energy in order to produce hydrogen. Once that energy is made, hydrogen needs a huge amount of that energy and then less than half of it coverts into usable energy. You need specialized equipment to make hydrogen. It is expensive. You have to be trained on how to operate it. You need a large facility. You need special permits to produce it. You need special permits to store it. You special equipment to store it. It must be stored at very cold temperatures. This costs money and energy. It must be stored in specialized equipment. Over time, the actual hydrogen itself breaks down the equipment. This is called EMBRITTLEMENT. Up to this point in the process, you have lost almost 30% of all the hydrogen you have just made. Hydrogen is really small. So it escapes into our environment, even with our best-known equipment ever made. Let’s say you have a buyer… you need a special license to sell it. Expensive!! The buyer will be charged for you to deliver it to them. (This is passed on to whomever they sell it to) And whoever buys it, needs specialized equipment to keep it cold and to not let it escape. Hydrogen is single-use. It isn’t renewable. Bottom line: hydrogen is inefficient, it relies on energy already made, it is extremely costly just to make, it is expensive to transport, it is extremely expensive to keep stored, it is single-use.

386,Australia,Hydro Power,"Up till quite recently the challenge was to get a clean energy source that would be cheaper than fossil fuels, the attention went towards that. It's only as renewable energy has grown that the question of balancing and thus of storage has gained prominence. Hydrogen is the 'cheap box that's expensive to fill' of grid storage technologies. You use it to fill out the final edge case as renewable energy penetration on the grid progresses towards being concerned with the 'rare event requiring deep reserves'. The requirement to fill this edge case comes after the other options along the continuum of grid storage technologies towards 'expensive box that's cheap to fill' are used (batteries are a good example here).

H2 is a bitch to store, that much is true, but that's mostly because it leaks from even the tiniest gaps, even completely leaking through some solid materials. You also want to use either extremely cold temperatures or very high pressures to achieve reasonable storage densities. Then there's what you probaly misinterpreted as corrosion: Hydrogen embrittlement. When diffusing through some materials, hydrogen will embed in their structure, making them more brittle. This doesn't affect all materials, only some metals, like steel and titanium. Stainless steel, copper and aluminium are much less affected by this. Composite materials, afaik, are not at all affected by this. The real answer is, we figured storage out a while ago, plus you don't even need to store it, as chemical industry will take the stuff off your hands anyway.

As a simple example, today we earn around $78 billion in revenue from iron ore exports. If we refined that and exported it as steel, it could make up to $707 billion in revenue,” the submission says “This version of an Australian bauxite industry would be earning $48 billion in exports, three times as much as today’s $16 billion,” Griffith says, although he adds that to do this will require an enormous amount of renewable electricity. “This highlights the importance of boosting our renewable energy production to assume the status of a world superpower,” he says. “That’s really the fundamental argument …up-processing these things in Australia to, maybe not finished stainless steel but at least into pig iron, or into a highly concentrated lithium brine, is absolutely how we should export our energy. “So use the renewables here to do that.

Whether that is a necessary expense or not is a different question, but there is a specific need for that type of power source for that type of application. We don't need power for the Australian grid to be able to be generated underwater for 4 months in a row. So it doesn't make sense to invest a huge amount of time and money in investing in nuclear energy when we can get more energy and quicker by investing in renewables. The idea of wasting a lot of money to build nuclear power plants in order to develop a domestic pool of talent to manage nuclear power plants doesn't make sense, if we didn't need the nuclear power plants in the first place. If you want to waste money on developing skills we don't need, then how about we replace a portion of our digital phone switchboards with manual ones, and then train a pool of talent as phone switchboard operators so that we have that skill handy to operate the unnecessary manual phone switchboards that we installed just so we could have a pool of talent to operate them.",4.8936,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Investment, Infrastructure, Technology"

That short term being defined by both needing to reduce carbon output and the end of life of existing coal & gas systems. Firstly there is no international capability to produce reactors in bulk or in any form of modular way. Every reactor is designed and built to custom spec. The net outcome of this is that individual power stations are expensive and slow to build. In comparison you can buy off the shelf coal furnaces, boilers and turbines and then just assemble them. If you look at reactors built recently in the western world the time scales of those builds are eye watering. The Vogtle power station is the latest reactor to come online in the US. This was an expansion of an existing plant, so much of the infrastructure was already in place, and yet it took 11 years from the start of construction to commissioning. The second is that we don't have the domestic skillset to build and operate the plants effectively. We have the capacity to learn those skills, but it is a workforce we don't have. This will add into the time to build, and the mistakes that will be made in the build that will need significant rectification. So if you said ""GO!"" right now, I genuinely believe we would be looking at 15 years before the first plant would be online. By which a vast number of our coal plants would have collapsed, and we would have had to build other solutions to keep things running anyway.

It would be such an unimaginable waste of money that even countries with nuclear industries would probably think it's a stupid waste of time for us to try.
Australia has the single most renewable energy resources on the planet with our solar and wind potential alone dwarfing everyone else. Renewables also get cheaper and better faster while being infinitely easier and faster to build.
By the time a nuclear reactor is finished here, renewables would dominate the grid to the point that the nuclear reactor would spend most of its time turned off as it'd actively cost money to sell the power. Any money spent on nuclear fission reactors would be infinitely better spent on researching and developing nuclear fusion instead.
.also, anyone that says things like ""the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine"" or whatever is speaking completely nonsense. Sunlight is relatively predictable, storage is getting better and power demand drops off dramatically while people sleep. As for wind, with our tens of thousands of KMs of coastline and loads of land, it is literally always blowing somewhere. Offshore wind in particular is pretty much always blowing. And, while the whole baseload power thing is increasingly becoming nonsense too, there are renewable sources of energy that are ""always on"" such as geothermal and tidal. At this point, the only reason to support nuclear fission here is ideological. In the interests of the economy, energy supply and actually cheap power, the only viable option for Australia is renewable energy for the foreseeable future. That is likely to change when nuclear fusion becomes commercially viable but until then, renewables it is. Note: I'm not against nuclear fission at all.

Although relatively “safe” the consequences of an accident or terrorism are much greater than any other alternatives. It contributes to the risk of nuclear proliferation by conventional or unconventional means. Every nuclear power system in the world is backed by significant state subsidies and special legal dispensations. Provides another opportunity to introduce even more draconian police state laws to “protect” the uranium-nuclear industry. The construction (and decommissioning) of nuclear facilities is extremely long, we need faster alternatives. The cost of operating nuclear power is not cost effective compared to the alternatives. We have cheaper options. We will also need to invest and develop supporting industries, which will add to the costs and timescales above. The alternatives provide more options for community-control, flexibility, decentralisation, and independence. Nuclear feels unAustralian.

635,Australia,Nuclear Energy,"Nuclear power is financially very risky and environmentally very risky. IN different ways. Financially, it will cost a lot more money than we're told, that is almost certain. Environmentally, who knows? When they go bad, it is catastrophic, and Dutton wants to give us seven. On the finances, there is the construction risk: Australia has a bad track record at complex projects that we've never done before, mostly because they are complex projects we've never done before. We are too small to get any benefit from the learning experience either: I'm sure by the time we built the 6th Collins Class submarine we were getting the hang of it, but that's all we made. Nuclear plants cause huge financial problems even for those who have experience at building them, so it's double trouble. There is the traditional financial risk: the opportunity cost. Even if all goes well, they require operation of several decades to pay back the cost of construction and the absolutely staggering cost of decommissioning (because it is a very toxic environment). You get very committed when you go nuclear. But who knows what the future holds? This why business will not invest in this (unless the government takes most of the risk, by providing long term power prices that will probably end up massively more expensive than renewables). A lot of smart people are convinced that even with today's technology, we don't need nuclear. Renewables and storage are young technologies, there will likely be breakthroughs in the next 20 years, let alone the next 40. Nuclear is a big bet against renewables. Given how fast renewables have got cheaper and how fast batteries are getting cheaper, this is crazy bet. The business case for nuclear assumes today's cost picture for the cost of electricity it is competing with, but it is very hard to make credible predictions about the alternative costs so far in the future. It is a gamble. Heck, fusion is making progress. We're going to look pretty stupid with fission reactors at that point. And the environmental risk. They don't go wrong very often, but when they do, it's really bad. An accident like Fukushima would devastate the reputation of Australian agriculture for years. It would probably lead to a mass movement to close down the remaining reactors. In my opinion, there is a military advantage to the decentralised grid we get from renewables, too. It will be a hard grid to break. And if someone drops a bomb on a field full of solar panels, it doesn't cause mass deaths. And where will the waste go? We can't even agree on a place to keep low level waste. Are these risks worth it? No. We don't need nuclear power so why take all those risks? That's the thing. We don't need it. We might need to keep a few coal generators open a few years longer, and use more gas for ten years than some people would hope for. That does not mean we need nuclear, which won't be ready until 2040, for one of them.
Unless the plan is actually to stop the rollout of renewables and keep coal and gas going until then. That is the only way it makes sense, to artificially construct the need for nuclear.

690,Australia,Nuclear Energy,"I can answer your questions. 1. I can’t answer broadly for extreme events. But all renewable installations are built to a certain risk tolerance, just like a power station. The less risk tolerance, the more expensive. So it’s a trade off. One the reasons nuclear power is expensive is that the stations have to be built to a very very low risk tolerance. Inevitably power generating institutions will go down (as happens to power stations). We all remember Fukushima I’m sure. Renewables are actually structurally (not engineering) more resilient because we rely on so many dispersed installations that losing an installation is easily managed. If a significant portion was lost (similar to losing a whole power station) then the excess capacity in the grid is spun up (and grids always have excess capacity). If there isn’t enough excess capacity built in, you get failures like in Texas where the cold snap stopped the operation of several coal and gas stations. It all depends on the system design. You can have less and more resilient electricity systems whether renewable, nuclear, or fossil fuel. It’s a question of how much money you’re willing to spend on it. In a way. Putting more expensive nuclear to provide security in case say a cyclone takes out offshore into the mix (putting nuclear tail risk aside) is simply another way of trading off cheaper power for more security. In short. There’s no inherit reason renewables are less secure. It’s a question of the entire grid’s design. 2. As for solar land use. There is naturally no solution to this. Your options are to (if you don’t want to cover hundreds of square kilometre of land) is to build more wind instead. Of course we also cover a significant portion of the land in agriculture so I would be more concerned about that than solar. The ANU thinks we need 1200 square kilometres of land. https://iceds.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/no-threat-farm-land-just-1200-square-kilometres-can-fulfil-australia%E2%80%99s-solar-and",1.275,"Policy, Economy, Environment, Cost, Investment"

700,Australia,Nuclear Energy,"Lets talk waste and safeness, since those are reasonable concerns. Waste: Until we have some sort of mass-scale capture and store, or other replacement for baseline we're stuck with coal and gas fired plants. Coal isn't clean and homogenous, it's a mineral dug out from the ground containing trace amounts of Uranium and Thorium (including their isotopes). When you burn coal you throw all the other elements out into the environment, so if you live within a couple of hundred km of a coal plant you're getting exposed to higher levels of ""radioactive waste"", and radiation, than someone who lives next door to a nuclear plant. And that's on top of the greenhouse gas issues. There are types of reactors that either produce very little waste, or can reprocess spent fuel to use as new fuel to reduce the small amount of waste they make. For what's left ( including the reactor itself) after 40 - 80 years or so of service you can safely dispose of it - it just costs a lot of money. It involves a gigantic hole in the ground and lots of concrete, that costs a lot more so many governments take cheaper / less safe approaches. If we want to go down the path of Nuclear it's up to us to push for safe disposal. Safety: Nothing's completely safe, but with Nuclear there is a lot more effort and cost focussing on safety (similar to the effort that goes into building a plane vs building a car) . That's the #1 reason it costs so much and takes so long. When you look at other disasters that have happened, and potential disasters, they tend to fall into the buckets of: Unstable environment (e.g. Earthquake, Tsunami) - Australia is lucky we have lots of stable places we can build to avoid this Bad design and human incompetence (Chernobyl) - simple to learn from and not use that type of reactor Similar for 3-Mile Island etc. War - pretty stable on that front and lets face it if someone starts attacking us (like China) we're so far away their only option is ICBM nukes anyway. And that's ignoring designs like molten salt that need the salt bath to maintain the reaction so if it blows off the reaction stops - meaning they can't meltdown. So compared to other choices for maintaining consistent load safety wise we have : Lithium battery tech for your house/car - far less safe than Nuclear, far more likely to burn your house down due to a fault (so great a chance many ebikes and scooters are getting banned from high-rise buildings). The safety tolerances just aren't there Coal... already discussed plus the risk to your safety if the greenhouse effect runs away gas-fired. better than coal but still pumps greenhouse gasses out which we can all agree are bad for long term health and safety Pumped hydro - probably the way to go but also difficult and costly, and there aren't a lot of great sites for it (and snowy 2.0 keeps getting bogged, it's starting to look like the only project that will cost more and take longer than Nuclear) Don't forget most of the Greenpeace fear-mongering was based on funds and info provided by shell corporations acting for the Coal and Fuels industries. We already have 1 reactor (Lucas Heights) - it's where most of the isotopes for medical use in Australia come from.

However, those figures are contested. A peer-reviewed 2020 study by the University of Queensland estimated the cost would be between $4,700/kW and $9,900/kW. The report says the capital costs would be recovered over the lifetime of the project. Because SMRs only exist on paper, that 2020 study is in large part based on what the NuScale project in Idaho, USA was expected to cost.

France with their massive fleet of aging nuclear reactors was a net importer of power from Spain, Germany and the UK for two years running. Even when their reactors are running, they have to sell at a loss or scale down production as they can't compete with renewables. That's why no private capital is going anywhere near it and is pouring into renewables instead. Also, any new nuclear we started now would be 10-15 years minimum to complete.

In Australia. Before a nuclear reactor is even built, an entire suite of technicians and engineers have to be built out of nothing. An entire regulator has be spun up with similar expertise to watch the industry and ensure it’s safe, then you have to create an educational program to reproduce those experts. After that the Australian government and whatever private actors bribed into doing it will have to construct one of the most difficult engineered projects without any personal experience. This all has to be solved by paying hundreds of foreign experts a lot of money to spend years overseeing it all. When it’s done. You have a well of expertise that quickly dissipates (unless you constantly build new reactors and plants). If you’re going to replace the same reactor in 50 years, it’s not far off from starting again contractor experience wise. This is the issue stalking countries like the US and the UK (wherein new reactors are financial disasters). So if you’re willing to put down billions and billions of dollars and a sustained government campaign with imported experts and new government agencies; why not get much better bang for your buck with renewable energy and energy storage? How will it be built in time meet the zero carbon goals anyway? How long will it take to do the policy planning, the training and institution building, the contract writing and negotiations with foreigners, the set up time to get hundred of people in place? 10 years? You know how long the average modern nuclear plant takes to build from the first concrete pour? 20 years. This would mean pursuing an ‘intern’ energy strategy, likely gas. Which economically means replacing coal with gas and then timing nuclear to replace it in 30-50 years (depending on how much of the capital costs of the gas plants you want to waste).",4.9033999999999995,"Here, Policy, Environment, Cost, Infrastructure"

The short answer is ""most likely yes"" but that's really not the right question to be asking right now. The right question we need to be asking is: What can we be building right now to replace our existing coal generators, since most of them are scheduled for retirement in the next 10-ish years? New coal or gas generators would be absolutely unthinkable, given the requirement for decarbonisation. Nuclear isn't a real option, since there is absolutely no chance we could have a single nuclear reactor in place before the major coal power stations are shut down. So the only logical solution is renewables and storage. It's relatively quick to build and scale up as required. Costs for solar, wind and batteries are all plummeting.

What’s more, the two most recent nuclear projects under construction — the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant and the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station — received approval in 2012 from the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), and are both over budget and far from completing construction.

French power plants mostly took between five and eight years to build. American plants used to be built at a similar pace, before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began to regulate the most minute aspects of construction. Contemporary American nuclear plants commonly take over a decade to build (assuming the construction plan is not simply abandoned).

While renewables are considered to be the fastest way to achieve these targets, most people don't realise the following: the time it takes to plan and build transmission systems hasn't improved with the increase in renewable projects. There are completed renewable plants in Australia that were completed more than 2 years ago and are still waiting to be connected to high voltage distribution networks. This is probably one argument in favour of Nuclear, in that there would need to be little additional transmission to replace current coal plants. even if you can replace the electricity generated by coal with renewables, you still need to build 2.5 to 3 times as much electricity generation capacity to account for the shift from hydrocarbons as a fuel source to electricity. This, in turn, increases the requirement for additional transmission even more. renewables currently can't provide all of the Ancillary Services that Baseload plants already provide. You need hydroelectric storage or gas plants to meet that need. globally, there is likely not enough copper to meet the increased demand in the metal due to renewables. For example, a 100 MVA battery bank will typically use 21 transformers (20 x 5 MVA and 1 x 100 MVA) for distribution. A single unit of a coal fired power station would require half to three quarters the number of transformers. On top of this, the entire electricity network will require upgrades due to the increased demand, amongst other applications. In the last 15 years, the amount of new copper reserves that were discovered were about 5% of the total discovered since 1990, in spite of several times more capital investment. In addition, the total amount discovered over those 15 years was close to the total amount discovered in 1991 alone!

984,Australia,RET,"There is no facing extinction global warming bull-dust. It's only a matter of picking a rational option to have cleaner air without plunging the world back into starvation a century ago. We have tradeoffs to choose. Liars talk about zero-emission energy system. No such things as there is no such technology. Every supply chain spills emissions. China produces 80% of solar/wind hardware, using low cost coal fired power. The more you install solar/wind, the more China spills emissions, which causes global emissions to increase every year despite reductions in the West thanks to the latter's switch from coal to gas. A 5-megawatt wind tower uses the same amount of steel, carbon fibre, cement and space as a 500-MW gas fired power plant. Wind is more emitting than gas in full life cycle. You can burn 10 times the capital and still end up with higher emissions as a whole. That's called idiocy or insanity. If you switch from coal to gas, you cut emissions (gas power has half the emissions of coal power) and retain supply chain in the West. Then you expand nuclear power to take over baseload power supply from gas or in conjunction with gas. This is the only way to return to an affordable, lower emission energy supply system with national security benefits. When ppl talk about solar / wind being cheaper than fossil fuel electricity, they don't talk about back-up supply cost. Electricity supply must be 24/7, otherwise it's useless. Solar / wind cannot provide first-world power supply without back-up from fossil fuel supply. As solar / wind average capacity factor is 1/10-1/5 of fossil fuel plant, you must build 5-10 times the plant capacity of fossil fuel to hopefully get an equivalent amount of energy generated by fossil fuel plant. Further, consumers cannot rely on ""average"" capacity of solar/wind. At any time, a solar /wind farm can lose almost all its production due to cloud cover or wind shift. Hence, the grid must have excessive fast-response plant (gas/diesel fuelled) to ensure smooth back-up supply. This is called ""firming"" capacity. The more you build intermittent solar/wind plant, the more you must build gas/diesel plant. This is where you can burn 10 times the capital and still cannot get very far towards net-zero. You can use batteries to do instantaneous back-up supply to solar/wind. But batteries are for storage, not additive generators like fossil fuel plant. You must charge them (while also supplying grid demand) before you can discharge them for back-up use. Hence, you must overbuild solar/wind/gas/diesel even more to do the charging - more capital spend. Batteries cost 3 times gas plant and can last only 2-3 hours, with plant life 1/3-1/4 that of gas/diesel plant so you have to keep replacing them. If your solar/wind system is down longer than couple hours, you have blackout or brownout. No way to run an industrial economy on that kind of power system. To back up solar/wind long term, you must keep building more and more gas/diesel plant. The latter can keep generating as long as there is gas/diesel to run. Superbly reliable. The only technology that can give you such baseload power without emissions at point of generation is nuclear energy. When comparing cost, you must do so apple with apple. To have usable 24/7 power supply, the cost of solar/wind/battery is many times higher than fossil fuel as currently, and also higher than nuclear. If nuclear has the time, commercial focus and government subsidies that governments in the West have thrown at solar/ wind over the last 20-30 years, it will be the cheapest and cleanest power supply system soonest. And the West is self sufficient in nuclear energy. As governments push societies further and further into the solar/wind/battery quagmire, power tariffs at consumer level have kept and will be keeping on rising. There is no escape. You can bring power cost down and build a sovereign (not relying on the China supply chain) system by going gas for next 20-30 years while filling the system up with nuclear energy over time. This is also the most effective way to lower global (Nox, Sox etc) emissions - for cleaner air, not necessarily believing in the humanity-threatening warming bull-dust.",4.747,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost, Infrastructure"

Renege on the Glasgow and Paris commitments. Looking at more than 3C of warming, virtually sterilising Australia and most of the world. This option lets us continue with todays politics and maintain the current economic market model. This will lead to eco extremism to ramp up, sabotage and terrorism will take place as people take matters into their own heads and hands. A deep, rapid and organised decarbonisation of society. Policy will look different place to place, but policy will be overarching, controlling, and vastly unpopular. Yet, we will be taking international equity and development seriously. Perhaps limit warming to 2C (still apocalyptic conditions). But we may start the road to a real zero future (pie in the sky stuff here). To achieve this we would need a massive ramp up of leadership (FDResk fireside speeches). Reshape mainstream economics so human capital is not viewed and being uncoupled from the natural world and with equity at its core. Ultimately rethinking what constitutes growth, progress and development. Really either option is not pleasant. In a society that failed to wear masks during a pandemic I’m far from optimistic at our chances. The time for technological solutions has passed. The northern hemisphere is already at 1.4c. This is having massive cascading impacts already (go read some food security papers in India/China for this year). We apparently have 9 years left in the global carbon budget (seems like a massive over estimate now). How is the global south meant to develop to a point where they can share the quality of life we enjoy in Australia with that little of the budget left? The restructuring of our energy mix, let alone overhauling the National car fleet will throw us well over the carbon budget (this is just for one small nation). To put this change in perspective, Emissions from today will be causing climate damages and warming for the next 300 years at least. Yes, driving your car today will be warming the planet for at least 300 years into the future. No amount of carbon credits is going to make up for that. The only option left is the social change. Yet, I worry people will never accept option two and the sacrifices this option entails. Would you be ok if Australia ceased exporting fossil fuels and took a massive hit to our GDP? Because that’s the level of change required now. Again we couldn’t all pull our heads together and wear masks.

A week of poor weather for wind & solar, multi year drought that reduces hydro storage etc. I don’t see how it would be possible to go 100% renewables without having extremely expensive battery storage on standby for these infrequent but highly likely to occur events. Think about it on a micro scale. House with solar & battery. Ok for 90% of the time. Cost say $20k without subsidies. Remove the grid and you have to add x number (say 2 additional) of batteries.

1131,Australia,RET,"Sorry, but this is complete fantasy. I’ve also worked in this industry for 20+ years and not in finance, as a sparky and now an energy technical support sme. We delivery grid scale integrated energy solutions including BESS. Do the numbers for renewables work? Yes. In so far as we can theoretically produce the current power we are using. However, to do it we need to take what is a centralised one way grid design and turn it into a decentralised network with shit everywhere. We’ve started doing this and it is a total clusterfuck already. There’s a reason the power engineers of the last century went with centralised power supply and didn’t instead build suburban generators, which would have made transmission far easier. The reason is simple. You need 100,000 electricians and mechanics instead of 50 who work at the large plant. On top of that, you need the best ones because power generation is just a tad more complicated than a Hyundai Tucson or installing a double GPO. Guess what we have fuck all of in Australia? Electricians and mechanics. We don’t need finance, or IT, or HR, or even engineers. We need technicians with practical skills to maintain this shit show of a grid. Next we need storage, and so much of it you can’t even fathom. Because solar and wind are unreliable. They do not produce power when we want it, they produce it when the weather suits. We can not accept unreliable power. Even hydro, the most reliable of green energy, relies on the weather and in a world where we can no longer rely on what the weather will do, is going 100% renewable smart? We have two viable storage options, BESS and water. For water, see the previous point. It has to be fresh and we need a shit load of it. If we had a shit load of viable pumped water sites in Australia we’d have the hydro plants already. This point is just complete horseshit. BESS isn’t the solution, I work on these things everyday. They need to be air conditioned, they’re incredibly dangerous and so they shut down to protect themselves regularly. Then you need to send a tech. Go back to the previous point about decentralised power and the maintenance needed. We are sending sparkies all over the country already to keep these things going. I can promise you we’ve produced more CO2 maintaining BESS than they will ever save us. A 40’ container can store about 8MW/h. It’s drained in about 30min. Even if we have 500MW/h stored,the amount you’d need to run a medium town like Cairns for the night, what do we do when its overcast the next day and we can’t charge our batteries? This isn’t a numbers decision, it’s a practical decision and the CSIRO never came to us to ask our opinion or costs I can tell you. No one in the industry is seriously considering 100% renewables because it would produce an unreliable shit storm where every house ends up running a little generator to cover the hours/days/weeks where the mains power is down. If you go 100% renewables you will get renewables and gas/coal. If we don’t start building some nuclear plants now, you can forget 2050 targets. While Dutton is a flog he’s bang on with this one. You simply can not tolerate an unreliable grid and to get reliability you need base load steam plants. So just choose your heat source, oil, coal, gas, or nuclear?

1135,Australia,RET,"Yes, easily. Talk to any of the countries going 100% and everyone one of them will say Australia has it the best and easiest to go 100% renewable. Battery tech will take 20 years to truly phase everything else out. Maybe less if we are lucky. But it'll come in the form of iron-sodium based batteries (probably, maybe something different) which are so insanely cheap and also not nearly as hard on the environment as lithium based products. Which is why, we need to spend 20 years phasing into mass solar, wind and hydro projects to be over-sized, and set up in a way to guarantee full batteries on the worst days to cover all down time. How do we know it's possible? I guarantee it is. But how can I say that? I have installed 2 batteries and 15kw of solar on my house. Year round I use more power than before installing the system. I averaged around $500 per bill for the household before. However now I am in growing credit to the utility despite paying connection fees. The system has cost under $30k, that means pay-back period is under 10 years.... However the life expectancy is more like 20. So if renewable is twice as cost effective for me to buy than use the utilities, then it's only MORE cost effective for them to do it. On top of that, this tech only gets cheaper.

1136,Australia,RET,I understand how its cost effective at an individual level but could we rely on batteries at grid scale.

1141,Australia,RET,"Yes, the countries that are able to get close to or be 100% renewable easily have advantages, an abundance of geothermal (Iceland) or Hydroelectric (Norway). South Australia for instance will soon be able to claim to be 'net 100% renewable' which will involve selling power to other sates when there is an excess but importing power from western states when needed. The claim is basically 'we produce more than 100% of our power usage even though some of our used power comes from non renewable sources'. I think thats a bit of a cop out as far as 100% goes because it only works when other states play ball as far as filling in power when needed. Tasmania for isntance has a goal of 200% renewables but this still doesn't mean all the power used in Tasmania will be from renewable sources. So X% renewable is a bit of a lie but net zero emissions is a possibility that we should probably be moving towards rather than 100% renewable. Especially since as always the devil is in the details 100% renewable could be twice the price of 95% renewable for instance. Finally whilst I may end up looking like a moron and eating my words but I think the storage technology will come. We can convert excess electrity to hydrogen for instance (and even synthetic hydrocarbons) neither of which is particularly efficient - about 40% round trip for hydrgoen. However considering the size of Australia we have the ability to have a significant amount of 'spare' electricity and the energy loss compared to batteries may not be that terrible. Honestly for the first time in history we are looking at having excess electricity and need to find something to do with it, and all of the things that are energy inefficiant may prove to be viable with absurdly cheap renewable energy. The US navy is working on converting nuclear power to jet fuel (useful for carrier groups), a UK company called ZERO is building a demonstration plant to make fuel using water and atmospheric CO2. So yeah, the future is looking bright for renewables even if the immediate path for Australia is simply 80-90% renewable it lays the groundwork for a possible future of 100% renewable and even exporting power. I'm aware of pilot projects to generate hydrogen with electrolysis, bond it with nitrogen to form ammonia which is more energy dense than hydrogen and already shipped around the world in decent quantities.

This also could be done with biomass but it's questionable if this is desirable. Possibly cheaper than storage is to just build significant overcapacity, this depends on the relative price of generation vs storage, or to use long distance transmission to smooth over large regions, which depends on the costs of transmission vs generation.

Neither is any discussion about the elephant in the room that is the futility of all this given the direction of the wider world where counties like China and India continue to build coal and increase emissions with no end in sight.

Use that hydrogen stored as fuel to burn if you need to ramp up power generaiton off peak for solar and wind. Solar farms that concentrate heat could also do the same thing with salt, super heat it, and store that super heated salt overnight to steam turn some turbines like normal if required. Hydro power where it is possible, as we will always have dams, will be an extra source available at all times unless droughts. But you can do the use excess power to pump water into dam, and use that for power off solar/wind peak. Batteries for extra backups and storage where required. It really depends how much money and effort we put into it. You also got tidel power to harness 24/7, but I'm sure that is specific to the environment in its use. Same with geothermal. And even if converting all this to coal only because climate change magically goes away, or nuclear. Renewables are often able to be manufactured, maintained and installed by a reasonable level of skilled trades. And a tapestry of different sources that can be made here in Aus, localised to a great degree, also puts us better off if wars break out. It's easier to target and seize big powerplants, than spend billions of missiles trying to wipe out solar and wind farms across the country side and on every roof. We can rebuild those quickly using local manufacturing and installation, with resources from here. It makes sense on a national security level too. But also social cohesion, it tends to best not to allow key peices of nation demand into easily monopolised assets that can be privatised. Renewables can be installed currently without government intervention and subsidies by the private sector, which will allow for much more competition to keep prices competitive in future even if we get a 'big solar' complex or something.

On that premise, to give a credible reply, this is a too much of a general question to be well served by just a couple of sentences that could fit on the back of a Mars chocolate bar wrapper. And to be credible, it needs to be qualified, hence the long winded spiel below. The short answer is no. We can't just switch to 100% renewable energy. Not now and not in the future, neither as a single nation, nor as an entire civilization, and here is why. We humans have advanced to become the supreme race on this planet because of our intellectual abilities. We modify the environment and use the resources around us to the extent where we can physically intrude and survive in other environments that are otherwise hostile to us. We wouldn't have ended up as the dominant race if we didn't do that. On Mount Everest, we bring warm clothing and oxygen tanks along. In the Sahara desert, we ride camels, cover our skin and bring enough water along to cool down and hydrate. 100 metres underwater, we bring air and pressurized suits or vehicles along. But, by the virtue of being the dominant race on our planet, we have the tendency to displace other species from their own environments by modifying those environments, to then turn them into use for own habitat, leisure, or to grow our own food. At the same time, we also create and manipulate our own technology, which uses far more energy than any one single type of environment can provide, so right alongside it, we also bring our own energy, usually stored in ways that allow us to manipulate it to power that technology, which then allows us to achieve God-like physics-defying feats. Fly faster than the speed of sound, move about in zero gravity, or zero air pressure or no air at all, or even in places where water or soil pressure would crush us in an instant. Starting with the Industrial Revolution, we discovered the wonders of fossil fuel combustion, while in the nuclear age, we learned how to split atoms to unlock unimaginable amounts of energy. We are warm-blooded creatures, and our combustion-centric technology forces us to tap into sources of energy that, by the sheer amount and concentration of caloric power, are only available in limited and non replenishable quantities. For the amount of energy and other resources mankind currently uses, we would now need to have access to other 18 Earth-like planets besides our own. But we don't, so guess what? We are doomed to perish by the mere virtue of the way we exist and multiply. So, to think that we'd ever become a fully sustainable, living on 100% renewable energy, is simply too foolish, and our very own demise is not a question of if but of when. Does all this sound depressingly fatalistic? You bet it does. But I'm yet to see any credible proof to the contrary. In Australia, we used to have a decent manufacturing sector. We don't anymore. Worse still, time and again, various projects, both at state and national level, have either been started and not finished on time or on budget, or not finished at all, or at least not in the way originally intended. Other countries can get there because their national and social cohesion is far stronger than ours, not to mention that their financial and technological potential is far superior than ours. I could go on mentioning the various failed Australian projects that support my skeptical outlook, but this reply would end up being a book instead. However, it's worth noting that we also lack the kind of national resolve needed to overcome the various petty obstacles, simply because, in our haste to continue enjoying the kind of freedom other nations envy us for, we've also become too individualistic and self-centred to make the kind of personal compromises needed to act in unison for the greater common good. In other words, we're only a nation in name and historical considerations, but otherwise, we will never be able to unanimously elect the kind of government that would channel and coordinate that kind of change.",4.9918,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost, Infrastructure"

Of course individual states, the local electrical providers and the local government can put their requirements and approvals on top of it too, but the national programs are the foundation.",4.8372,"Policy, Technology, Investment"

1227,Australia,Solar Energy,"When solar technology got to the stage of marketability, the state governments made a conscious decision to promote it in order to create economies of scale - which succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Here in Western Australia, the government decided that because solar panels are visible, it becomes a perpetuating trend where people can be more sustainable and save themselves money long term. (There were a few options at the time in terms of sustainable projects and residential rooftop solar was picked as the one which would have the most enduring impact). The WA state government provided a pretty sizeable rebate on solar panels, and then also the feed-in tariff was huge. It was a massive cost to the government, but it was done deliberately to create a market for solar and drive down the prices over time. It was incredibly successful, and as the goal was met, the feed-in tariffs were reduced more and more. (WA electricity is state owned and highly subsidised so this didn’t involve commercial interests). I was working in electricity at the time and remember when one Minister was upset that it was so successful ($$$) and the other Minister was jubilant. It was hilarious. Being one of the sunniest places in the world, it totally makes sense. Our home panels paid for themselves in 2 years. It’s all free energy from here.",4.9852,"Policy, Investment, Technology, Environment"

Additionally, govt offers a substantial upfront rebate for solar installations, with the installer taking care of the paperwork. The quoted price for individuals includes this rebate, making it lower. In comparison, the United States faces higher average electricity prices than Australia. Consequently, companies in the U.S. enjoy a significantly higher profit margin compared to their Australian counterparts.

Electricity is more expensive and WFH was a thing so the convenience of running your air conditioner all day for no cost is amazing. I think people are too focused on the payoff time instead of the benefits. It's mostly phone call/cold call leads and offers on billboards. Cold callers get a list of numbers probably from an expression of interest website, get the clients details, salesman comes to home to pitch them the product. Had a friend do cold calling, $600 per lead that led to a sale, got a company phone to use while he was doin it. Although you're mostly on your own. Installs are usually half day affairs.

I found a website, made an appointment with a salesman. Eventually I managed to pin him down to:- a battery would cost about $11K to buy outright, at present there are government rebates to reduce that to about $6K. HOWEVER. This particular salesman insisted that before I could get the battery I would have to sign up for another 12 panels on the house roof, because he insisted the battery would have to be installed right beside the meter box, which is on the house (so far nobody agrees with him, btw). He finally caved and admitted the whole 12 panel array would be $22K outright including rebates. I have yet to shop around some more and see what other companies are offering. There are loans available, even interest free. All that I've seen use one's electricity retailer as a loan manager. One can pay them off with excess electricity fed back into the grid.

You use less electricity, so the price per kW for purchased electricity goes up a little, again, because of the service charge. Expected behaviour change because of being more aware of your consumption? Lucky dip. Some people use more total power because they reckon cheaper now, I'll take the comfort. As far as the economics, I used solarquotes.com.au and nothing on that website turned out to be incorrect, including the various calculators there. His output calculator matched at around 96% of what we're actually getting across multiple years. That impressed me. There's lots there and he's started to cover electric cars as well. With hindsight, you could say our system should have been bigger, but it was based on likely usage. It was based on our usage figures which was best practice at the time. Nowadays, provided you get approval for your area, maximise use of roof space, and I wouldn't put up less than 6.6 kW for a 4-bedroom house.

With feed in tariff credits, the ROI was 2 years, so any savings i am making now are genuine savings. If your sales person is calculating your ROI based on a high feed in tariff, do your own numbers with the FIT you can find on your preferred suppliers website, because it could be a lot less. Best i can find now is 12c/kw. If you WFH, it's great. Do your washing, dryer, dishwasher, air con etc during the daylight hours when it's only using your solar. Set your air con/heat to automatically start 1.5 hours before you lose sun on the panels to pre cool/warm the house. Using the solar during the day is better than getting the low feed in tariff.

If the battery lasts 5000 cycles then you're saving $840. Most of the battery systems in Australia cost over $1200 per kWh installed, so they will never pay themselves back. There are some battery brands that have a retail price that is within payback. Pylontech US3000c 3.55kW batteries are about $550/kWh in bulk and are rated to 6000 cycles. Each kW installed should generate about $1008 in savings, if they last as long as they say. That also doesn't include installation costs.

With spot rates and optimisation you can import on negative prices and export into price spikes to get ROI ata faster rate. That's not to say that it's a smart investment though. You're going to sink $15k+ into an asset that will hopefully cut your energy bill to nothing so your break even point is likely close to a decade away.

1580,Australia,Solar Energy,"I live on Qld Gold Coast - so similar climate to you on the Sunshine Coast. I suggest before you make any decisions thoroughly analyse your current electricity usage. If you have a smart meter you should be able to see your usage by the hour or half hour on line (depending on your biller). So you can see your own family's specific usage by time of day. My biggest winter users are the ducted aircon - set to heat from 5am to 7am every day. Followed by cooking the main evening meal - 4.30'ish to 6.30'ish (oven being the biggest user) - and the dishwasher 8pm every night (after the peak time period). Sure I could use the dishwasher when the solar power is being generated but TBH I would find that pretty inconvenient. So the 3 biggest winter power consumers in my house are used when there is no solar generation - so solar would not benefit me at all for the Big 3 - unless I had a battery - which there is no way I could afford. The same Big 3 for summer usage - the aircon - cooling at various times depending on the temperature, by far the biggest summer user. And yes - there would be an opportunity to use some solar generated power for the aircon. But most days there is no way we could turn off the aircon when the panels stop generating solar power and expect our home to stay cool for hours after that so we could sleep in a cool house - as I have seen in some comments - our house would heat up again in no time! And yes we have roof insulation - and have draught proofed our home etc. Our main cooking would still be 4.30 to 6.30'ish and dishwasher 8pm - both when no solar power would be generated. Note: I have LPG instant HWS - which will probably be replaced with electric when it dies. My cooktop is one gas ring (used infrequently) and 2 induction . I thoroughly researched solar about 4 months ago. Our roof space is not large - and we do not have the space for a vast array of panels to be installed. We were being quoted on 6.6 'ish systems. All the salesman's cost benefit analysis were based on some type of average usage, not truly specific to when I actually use the most power. When I did my own analysis using my specific usage times my results were very different to what the salesmen were telling me! I decided against solar - could not justify the expense for such a small system (without storage) at my age. The feed in tariff is low and will only go lower. Plus there is a real risk that my single level home will be in the shadow of a high rise within the next 5-10 years.

Look at installing a catchpower solar relay or if you want a cheaper alternative you could just install a basic timer if you have a standard hot water cylinder on off peak. There are alternatives to this but that gets further into the weeds. Also wait until you have your solar installed and your meter changed (if this is required - your solar retailer should know this) before you change energy plans as this can cause quite a few complications if done half way through.

We generally burn through about 30-40kWh per day but it fully fits inside the solar production in summer, mostly all in winter, and therefore our quarterly energy grid bill is about $200 instead of $2000. Half of that cost is just the daily supply charge. We try to make the vast majority of our energy just during the day rather than overnight, since the feed-in tariff we get is rubbish and will disappear one day anyway.

Nearly all of your peak generation happens when you’re not home (at work presumably not WFH). Your energy provider will offer you 1:10 of the value of the power that they bill on to others. Any shade at all on a panel will wipe out the panels in the same circuit. So don’t bother if they aren’t going to get full Sun. You gotta clean them or their generation potential goes down fast. A good bird poo is the same as a shadow. So if you’re not good on the roof yourself, it’ll never make economical sense hiring people. Rebates are all essentially over, credit schemes are gobbled up by crafty sales people who sell you the install. The only way solar makes sense, is if you spring for a battery as well. Otherwise you’re just giving power away for others to profit from and paying through the nose when u need it. Any battery you’re getting subsidised through an energy provider will mean ur signing up to their virtual power plant shit - which only benefits them.

This is best experienced during a blackout - during the day? you can just run off of solar to power the house no worries; during the evening/night? you should have easily stored enough in your battery storage to see you through the night, particularly useful if anyone in the house uses something like a cpap machine or oxygen tank and needs to be able to power them all night. It may take a while for the system to pay for itself, but I'd argue that energy independence and redundancy are reasons alone to install a solar panel and battery array. That aside, think about the fact you'd pretty much just be using the system to power your home during the hours people are home in the evening/night with little to no need to use grid energy. I can see that $600 per quarter cost drop dramatically, so long as you're diligent with making sure you're switching to battery storage, plus, you can always feed energy back into the grid during the day - it's not lucrative like it used to be but it should still yield something for your efforts (you'd have to look up the fine details to see how it all works where you live).",4.9076,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Environment, Technology, Cost, Infrastructure"

The fact that you have no gas is a potential win: heating and cooling are typically the biggest power draws. This includes hot water systems. Some hot water can be put on a timer; guaranteed savings right there. If your home is insulated and your heater or AC gets used a lot? Put it on a timer and use solar to pre cool/heat before you are home. Don't even need to change your habits to move significant power consumption to solar hours for significant savings. But this is AusFinance, so let's put that in perspective with some napkin math. Let's say you invested $10k for 6 years and got a guaranteed 7% interest, and didn't have to pay tax on the gains. You'd have $15k at the end, gains of $5k. One way of looking at it is a bit over $800 per year.

Panels are well worth it (around 15% to 20% internal rate of return) unless you have serious shading issues. Domestic storage batteries do not yet have a positive return. There are more options today, such as switching water heating to daytime only (provided tank is large enough), so as to consume more of your own power. Domestic water heating is the most cost-effective form of surplus energy storage from solar panels. Some installers will upscale to include battery and show a positive return. It will be less than panels alone, essentially using the great return on panels to make the battery look good. They'll emphasise that being away during the day you must have battery. All flat-out crap to make a bigger sale. Don't fall for it. You'll probably use the timers on your appliances to run dishwasher and laundry when you're out. Your aircon likely also has a timer, so you can turn it on before you get home. Plus hot water as mentioned. Other options open up but may be too much bother.

1821,Australia,subsidies,"Publication: Australian Financial Review Author: John Kehoe The transition to cleaner energy is becoming a tax break and subsidy gravy train for higher income earners and the wealthy. Hard-working taxpayers are funding all sorts of federal and state concessions for electric vehicles, solar panels and electrification of homes, while the less fortunate struggle to afford their energy bills. The handouts are an extremely expensive way to reduce carbon emissions, as the Productivity Commission highlights. It marks a failure of the political system to sustainably impose a relatively low-cost, economy-wide and efficient carbon price, tax or levy. Instead, resorting to tax breaks and subsidies is very inequitable. People with above-average incomes and wealth who can afford electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, new heating and cooling systems benefit disproportionately. People who can’t afford these clean-energy technologies will miss out. I recently replaced our family home’s old, ducted, gas-heating system after it blew up. The Australian Capital Territory offered me an extremely generous 10-year, interest free loan of $15,000 to replace the gas heater with an electric system. In today’s dollars the subsidy is worth at least $3300, assuming an average inflation rate of 2.5 per cent. In a high-inflation and rising-interest rate environment, the subsidy is likely worth a lot more than that, compared with a commercial interest rate. Naturally, I took the taxpayer-backed deal to buy a new reverse cycle heater and air conditioner, even though I felt it was dudding other ACT ratepayers. But it seems I’m not the only person financially benefiting from the scheme. The ACT government has hired clean energy financier Brighte to administer the sustainable household scheme. https://imgur.com/a/yvJLvkB Brighte is part-owned by billionaire software entrepreneur and clean energy advocate Mike Cannon-Brookes through his Grok Ventures. The ACT government in partnership with Brighte is offering similar generous deals for rooftop solar panels, household batteries and storage, air conditioners, hot water heat pumps, electric stove tops, electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging and ceiling insulation. It’s not surprising that the forecast loans under the scheme have swelled by 33 per cent to $200 million. The ACT, which easily has the nation’s highest median household income because of ubiquitous, well-paid public servants, has about double the number of electric vehicle sales per capita, the Australian Automobile Association says. Tax breaks for the wealthy Nationally, EVs have become one of the biggest tax breaks for the well-heeled. They benefit from the Commonwealth’s exemption from fringe benefits tax (FBT), cash subsidies from state governments and discounts on stamp duty and registration fees. Exempting low and zero-emission cars from FBT potentially saves buyers as much as $30,000, excluding other state government handouts. It’s a boon for the sales of Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world’s second-richest billionaire on the Forbes rich list. Yet, tax breaks for EVs are an extremely expensive and ineffective way to reduce carbon emissions. The Productivity Commission estimates the cost of carbon dioxide abatement for EVs from the FBT exemption at between $987 and $20,084 a tonne. The cost to taxpayers dwarfs the carbon price paid by heavy emitters of less than $40 a tonne via Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) and the $75 carbon price cap the government has imposed for the carbon safeguard mechanism. The commission notes that supply constraints and delivery delays are already leading to extended wait times for EVs in Australia. “With supply the principal constraint for EV uptake in Australia, policy efforts to increase the demand for EVs, such as tax concessions and rebates for EV purchases, run the risk of simply adding more people to the proverbial queue, subsidising people who are already in the queue, or in the case of tax concessions that are selectively available to some groups, simply pushing those selected groups to the front of the queue – all for no appreciable gain to the overall number of EVs on Australian roads, relative to what would have otherwise been the case,” the commission says. “Using the FBT [fringe benefits tax] system for alternative policy goals like attempting to drive EV uptake risks compromising the degree to which the FBT system protects the integrity of the personal income tax system, potentially reinforcing equity concerns in the process.” Meanwhile, the South Australian Labor government has scrapped a planned road-user charge for EVs, fulfilling a populist election commitment. Again, another tax break for well-heeled EV drivers, while battlers driving petrol-guzzlers pay fuel excise.",4.9928,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost"
1822,Australia,subsidies,"Good Victorian policy Tax economists such as Ken Henry (a strong environmentalist) have for more than a decade advocated road-user charges for all vehicles, embedding the cost of road surface damage, noise, congestion and carbon emissions into the price. Much more sensibly in Victoria, electric vehicle drivers already pay 2.6¢ per kilometre and plug-in hybrid car drivers 2.1¢ per kilometre. But with the $12 billion federal fuel excise revenue in decline, the Commonwealth is inexplicably joining a High Court challenge against Victoria’s EV charge. Victoria is enacting good tax policy (a rare compliment from this writer for Dan Andrews’ government). Road user charges are a more economically growth friendly form of taxation than damaging state taxes such as stamp duties on property sales, insurance taxes and narrow payroll taxes. User charges on drivers could also reduce vertical fiscal imbalance between the federal and state governments. States currently account for about 22 per cent of the nation’s tax revenue but are responsible for about 40 per cent of spending and are highly dependent on financial transfers from the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is interfering by backing Victorian EV driver plaintiffs who argue the charge is an excise, which only the Commonwealth can levy. In theory, the Commonwealth wants to retain the right to impose a federal EV road user charge in the future. But Victoria, with other states such as NSW due to follow, is getting on with the job. It is better to implement the charge now because it will be much more politically difficult in future years. As French statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert famously said in the 1600s, “The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”. The danger in deferring to the Commonwealth to implement a national road-user charge scheme, is that it will take too long – if it ever develops the political courage – and there will be too many EV drivers resisting by the time it gets its act together.",3.68,"Policy, Tax, Jobs, Economy, Environment, Technology, Cost, Infrastructure"

The big issue with residential subsides nowadays is that it is delivered as a tax credit. The wealthy are getting good deals because they can pay in cash and use the tax credit themselves.

That being said, the sudden removal of subsidies could certainly impact the industry, especially in the short term. Companies that have relied heavily on subsidies may struggle initially, but the overall trend towards lower costs and increased efficiency suggests that the industry is moving towards sustainability without subsidies. There are also other factors at play, such as the increasing focus on sustainability and renewable energy targets by governments and businesses, which could help drive demand for solar energy even in the absence of subsidies. In conclusion, while the solar industry has benefited from subsidies in the past, it is increasingly able to stand on its own without them.

On top of coal royalties, and GST at the pump, You get the excise tax back if you don't use roads, i.e. diesel for your fishing trawler, or farm harvester, or mining truck. You don't get the GST back, and If you drive on roads then you don't get the excise back either. Where is this lost money going to come from if not an excise tax on renewables? You don't get that tax on renewables. If giving back excise to people who don't use roads is a subsidy, then not charging excise at all, even if you drive your electric car on roads must also be a form of subsidy that's even greater.

2248,Australia,subsidies,"More and more Australians are struggling to afford their power bills. Origin and AGL have released new data showing the number of customers in their hardship programs has risen by 35,000 – a 40 per cent increase in one year. Around 125,000 households now rely on bill relief from the two companies. Australia’s bulging pipeline of renewable energy developments has been hit by construction and registration delays, with the market operator flagging a substantial increase in the time taken to deliver projects into the nation’s grid. Data from the Australian Energy Market Operator showed that while it approved 12 gigawatts of connection applications in the last financial year, bottlenecks had seen a jump in the timeline for delivering new energy supplies. The “time taken for developers, construction providers and original equipment manufacturers to physically deliver these projects has increased substantially with 75 per cent of projects taking up to 21 months to be constructed and ready for market registration”, AEMO says in its latest engineering roadmap report. “Key challenges include project financing, the volume and complexity of contractual arrangements, workforce resourcing and supply chain constraints.” Australia will need to install 16 times its current capacity in batteries and pumped hydro by 2050, while large-scale wind and solar generation will have to jump sixfold if the country is to achieve a transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In the near term Labor has set an ambitious target of having renewable energy generate 82 per cent of the country’s electricity by 2030. To hit that target, some 6GW of capacity must be added every year. However, AEMO said delays meant only 2.4GW of projects achieved market registration last year while 2.2GW achieved full output in the 2024 financial year. Over the past three years, the number of connection applications received by AEMO has nearly tripled from 6.5GW across 45 sites in 2022 to 19GW across 81 sites in 2024, according to AEMO. The operator said the time taken to reach full output across 75 per cent of projects has been cut from 11.2 months in 2023 to 6.9 months or less in 2024. However, problems in the physical deliver of projects remained a handbrake. “These are challenges that fall outside of AEMO’s direct remit and instead require broad whole-of-sector efforts to address, without which there will be difficulties in realising the 2024 integrated system plan optimal development path,” AEMO noted. The warnings come after industry players said a major wind drought that caused wholesale prices to spike provided a stark warning about what would happen if Australia did not develop a diverse mix of fuel sources, amid broad concern the role of gas was being downplayed. AGL Energy chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said a wind drought in the June quarter illustrated the need for a broad range of generation types. “The low wind levels across the National Electricity Market in recent months demonstrate the importance of a diverse and flexible portfolio of assets that can respond to variable conditions,” said Mr Brokhof. “Through this period AGL was able to rely on the increased availability of our thermal fleet in combination with our hydro assets, gas peaker and battery portfolio to meet our customer load. As the penetration of renewables increases in the coming years, firming and short and long duration storage provided by grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro, and gas peaking plants will become increasingly important.” The comments are a stark warning as the role of wind is expected to grow as Australia struggles to develop sufficient back-up options.",1.7526,"Policy, Environment, Jobs, Infrastructure, Tax, Investment, Cost, Policy"
2249,Australia,subsidies,"To meet the 2030 target, Australia must install about 40 wind turbines a month, an ambitious feat that could leave the grid more precariously placed. “There is a lot of attention on developing renewable energy but what is going to support the grid when the conditions aren’t suitable? Batteries do the job for a few hours but the wind drought this year illustrates the need for gas,” said one senior industry executive who declined to be named. Australia’s east coast faces tight supplies. The Australian Energy Market Operator in March said a gas shortfall could emerge as soon as next year and although mitigating steps could be taken, a deep structural deficit would emerge in 2028. A bitterly cold winter saw AEMO issue an emergency warning earlier this year, and data released by the market operator showed wholesale electricity prices had spiked as a result. The cost of producing electricity across the national market averaged $133/MWh in the three months to June 30, 23 per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, the operator said. The increase followed a slump in renewable energy generation as wind output fell to a multi-year low, increasing Australia’s reliance on gas. AEMO said during the three months, gas-fired generation rose 16 per cent from the same period one year earlier. The increase in wholesale prices will not be immediately felt by households and businesses, but the rise will be a major component in the next default market offer – the benchmark price for annual bills. The increase in wholesale prices was particularly beneficial to Australia’s largest electricity and gas retailers, Origin Energy and AGL Energy.

2307,Australia,Wind Energy,"I've attended a talk by the liberal party ""think tank"" on nuclear, because I was at a renewable power conference and they somehow got on the program. I will say, their analysis is quite correct from a technical perspective except for politically, but I'll get back to that later. Its basically all them scamming us to convince a bunch of boomers that when there are power problems it was all Labors fault. Effectively, they point out that nuclear can be built cheapely and economically. The US model of building nuclear with a private industry is not viable. Only a government led organisation with special rules around project long term operation is workable. Let's look at that politically. A new government run large infrastructure entity is not acceptable to the Liberal party. Or they will sell it at a discount as soon as practical. The Labor party are more amenable in a general sense, but are very aware that the last time they did this, the liberals deliberately damaged the project on purpose to avoid giving the Labor party any wins and they hurt the country to do it. For a nuclear plant that's an extremely bad idea. I personally feel if the only way to build a nuclear plant is for both a state and a region (say everyone within 50km of the proposed site) have a plebiscite where they both must agree. Only on dual agreements are all environmental and planning lawsuits on procedural grounds bypassed, since bad faith lawsuits often caused large delays and delays drive around 30-40% of costs. But as I said, the Liberal party would deliberately hurt the project if it was a Labor job and they also would never start it themselves, since they want to privatize everything.",1.1096,"Here, Policy, Jobs, Economy, Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost"

It's also a hard no cause that plant has been decommissioned for years, and has 150MW nameplate output aka would be a smol baby nuclear power plant aka not worth doing.

Which I am going to go ahead and bet is the cheapest part of a fucking nuclear power plant, before the reactor and the turbines and shit (the last two 100% need replacing or else this is legit ""grandfather nuclear power plant"").

The report said that this would make the electricity grid unstable without coal fired baseload power to take up the slack and unable to rely yet solely on renewable power alone.

Natural gas emits about 470 kg of CO2 per MWh: $116 - (0.47*23) = $105, which is still 31% more expensive than wind, even without the carbon tax. Coal and gas are already more expensive than new-generation wind, even without a carbon tax.",4.1148,"Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost"
2548,Australia,Wind Energy,"That was the whole point? As opposed to subsidising carbon heavy sources as has often been done, unfortunately in retrospect.",3.0,"Policy, Environment, Note, Subsidising"
2549,Australia,Wind Energy,"The problem is not the cost/kWhr that is the issue with. It's the control over when those kWhrs get produced. With coal it is very reliable, feed coal (or any other fossil fuel) into power station, get power out. With wind it is very unreliable, build power station, hope to get power out. Now if I was a consumer and wanted to keep my freezer running all the time, which system of power do you think I'll choose.",3.3558,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Cost, Infrastructure"

2553,Australia,Wind Energy,"China has a $19,000 per vehicle subsidy for electric vehicles.",3.0,Investment
2554,Australia,Wind Energy,"Is it really that China is hell bent on destroying the world, or is that they think they'll do better pursuing cheaper energy no matter what while the rest of the world through policy pursues more expensive/cleaner energy for them?",2.0196,"Investment, Policy"
2555,Australia,Wind Energy,$84 per MWh is really reasonable. The only form of energy in the US that is cheaper is Natural Gas (about $70/MWh). I believe or wind cost is in the $100/MWh range (within $10 of that). Granted there are many factors that they may or may not be including that could make this not perfectly apples to apples.,4.6856,"Tax, Investment, Technology, Environment, Cost"
2556,Australia,Wind Energy,"the cost of the carbon tax/trading scheme ($23/ tonne) actually substantially undervalues the total (long term) cost of CO2 emissions, the price will be raised gradually over time to reflect the true cost. So, with LESS than the total cost, coal is still more expensive. We wont know the ""exact"" cost to humanity of CO2 emissions until its too late. There is actually a section of legislation in Australian state laws called the Precautionary Principle, which basically says: in situations of uncertain impacts, we must act with what we DO know to prevent as much environmental damage as possible, rather than waiting around indefinitely for better info (while everything goes to shit). From what is known about fossil fuels and wind power, environmental damage costs in the long term for FF are much greater than wind. Also, on this ""cheap (fossil fuel) energy"" argument: the world will run out of cheap (in the short term costings) fossil fuel energy, so alternatives must be introduced to enable a transnational period. A gradual transition is needed for predictable energy prices, predictable prices encourages economic investment(lower risk investment), which leads to growth and jobs etc. Switching suddenly to another energy generation method when we run out of fossil fuels requires shittonnes of research and development and investment in unproven things etc which causes economic instability(high risk investment) which discourages investment. Im not saying wind is a cure all either, with current technology anyway.",1.8812,"Policy, Jobs, Economy, Cost, Technology, Note, The, Precautionary, Principle"
2557,Australia,Wind Energy,"I CALL BULLSHIT. Relying on fossil fuels to produce electricity is getting more expensive because of the government’s price on carbon emissions imposed last year, higher financing costs and rising natural gas prices, BNEF said. The cost of wind generation has fallen by 10 percent since 2011 on lower equipment expenses, while the cost of solar power has dropped by 29 percent. They are showing the end PRICE not COST. The end PRICE is lower because Australia subsidizes wind energy while it taxes coal into the ground. The story reports the final PRICE after the government has meddled in the market. The true COST isn't discussed. I understand that... price = cost to the consumer, but the article was very misleading. Cost to consumer (after taxes, subsidies, ect) is not equal to cost to produce.",1.2684,"Cost, Investment"
2558,Australia,Wind Energy,"Lol, coal is one of the most heavily subsidized commodities in Australia. Take your ignorance elsewhere.",2.2776,"Tax, Environment"
2559,Australia,Wind Energy,"The government actually subsidises coal in several ways, coal is subsidised more than renewables in general, and the taxes on coal are fairly low too. Total cost of coal is much higher in the long term when the environmental impact is taken into account.",2.4536,"Policy, Cost, Environment, Tax, Infrastructure"
2560,Australia,Wind Energy,"This is the whole point of the Carbon Tax. The idea is to accelerate the economics involved to make developing alternative, carbon neutral generation a more economically enticing option decades earlier than would naturally occur. The Carbon Tax is an input in this equation, to ignore it misses the point completely. This article shows that the carbon tax is working to alter the economics, whether or not it will work to change generation and industry practices is still to be seen.",1.3748,"Policy, Investment, Environment, Tax, Technology"
2561,Australia,Wind Energy,"The true COST isn't discussed. Your use of ""true COST"" is quite ironic. Coal has heaps of negative externalities that are normally not factored into the price. The carbon tax goes some way towards correcting for this, which allows the market to produce more efficient outcomes - the cost is now undoubtedly closer to the ""true COST"" than it has ever been in the past.",4.7038,"Cost, Environment, Tax, Investment, Technology"

2565,Australia,Wind Energy,"Honestly, it's irrelevant. The cost for coal is (literally) human extinction or at least an unbelievable pruning back that our civilization can't survive. We have to quit that now and push like mad at getting wind and solar out there.
