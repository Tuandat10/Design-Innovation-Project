Biomass energy to provide heat, fuel

Updated: April 15, 2021 08:59 China Daily

From plants and wood, to crops and animal droppings, all of these examples of organic waste could soon becom
energy sources to heat homes and fuel cars.

Biomass, such as agricultural and forestry products, organic household waste as well as livestock and industria
some of the biological materials used as fuels in producing electricity and heat.

Biomass can be burned directly for heat, or converted to renewable gaseous and liquid fuels through thermal, 
biochemical processes.

Under the energy efficiency and carbon intensity targets set by the Chinese government, the country's develop
energy will see fast track growth thanks to preferential policy support, experts said.

""The development of the biomass energy industry in China has ushered in an important window period under 
green commitment and the industry has great potential for further growth,"" said Zhang Dayong, secretary-gen
Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association.

China vows to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2060.

During the recently closed two sessions, China's commitment to green development was reiterated by Premier

While delivering the Government Work Report, Premier Li said China plans to reduce energy consumption pe
13.5 percent and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18 percent during the 14th Five-Year Plan perio

""China's strong green commitment will provide more opportunities of growth for biomass energy developmen
the only zero-carbon fuel among renewable energy sources. If it is equipped with BECCS technology, (bioenerg
capture and storage), the process of turning biomass into energy can achieve negative emissions,"" Zhang said.

BECCS is the process of extracting energy from biomass and capturing and storing the carbon, thereby removi
atmosphere.

At present, China produces about 6.3 billion metric tons of organic waste on average per year, according to Zh

""By processing 40 percent of this into energy, which is a goal that is likely to be achieved in the near future, Ch
its carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent, which is about 2.3 billion tons. That is very meaningful for China's

development,"" Zhang said.

""Developing biomass is also meaningful in helping reduce reliance on fossil fuels and diversifying energy sourc
added.

BEIPA said that each year China produces over 900 million tons of agricultural and forestry biomass which ca
power equal to that from nearly 400 million tons of coal. The number is even larger when adding organic wast
and rural areas.

However, at present only around 90 million tons of agricultural and forestry biomass is used for power genera

Aside from stating energy efficiency and carbon intensity targets, the 14th Five-Year Plan also sent positive sig

A BEIPA report said more support from government to boost the industry's development is expected in the ne

The report estimated that about 1.2 trillion yuan ($183.6 billion) will be invested in the industry from 2021 to 
could help the industry handle about 350 million tons of organic waste, and create job opportunities for aroun
people.

By 2030, the proportion of biomass energy in renewable energy will increase to about 8 percent, according to t

""At present, China's development of biomass is still at an early stage but is developing at a fast pace,"" Zhang sa

Currently, a total of 466 projects have been put into operation or are under construction.

Last year, installed capacity of biomass power generation increased 5.43 million kilowatts to 29.52 million kW

Biomass power generation reached 132.6 billion kilowatt-hours during the same period, a 19.4 percent increas

""The industry's development faces a lot of challenges. Currently, only about 5 percent of organic waste is proce
bioenergy — electricity and gas generated from biomass,"" Zhang said.

He explained that there are various reasons behind the relatively low processing rate of bioenergy. ""The install
biomass power generation is very low, at about 30,000 kW on average per project, compared with 600,000 kW
kW for that of coal power generation, which means that the amount of electricity generated through a certain a
biomass is far less than the same amount of coal, or other mainstream energy sources.

Lin Boqiang, head of the China Institute for Studies in Energy Policy at Xiamen University, said: ""Insufficient 
materials, such as crops, is another problem that hinders the industry's development.

""Sometimes the cost of transport and storage is even higher than the money farmers can get from selling crops
would rather burn the crops instead of hauling them to power generation plants.

""It is unlikely that they could sell the crops at higher prices considering current stable electricity prices.""

High costs of collecting raw materials and relatively low generation rates of electricity compared with coal and
mainstream energy sources have made government subsidies an important support for the industry's developm

the subsidies began to phase out in recent years, according to Lin.

Han Xiaoping, chief researcher at industry and energy website china5e.com, said new business models are exp
innovation in cooperation between power generation companies and farmers.

""More efforts are needed to improve the transportation, storage and sales networks of raw materials, as well as
products with high added value and extend the industrial chain,"" Han said.

In addition to high costs of collecting raw materials and relatively low generation rates of electricity compared
other mainstream energy sources, the development of biomass is also challenged by factors like low added valu
electricity generation, electricity generation and sales centered profit models as well as restrictions on bioener
electricity market, said Li Yin, chairman of Jiuzhou Electronics.

""More diversified revenue sources of biomass energy aside from electricity generation, such as heating, are cal
government, industry experts and executives,"" Zhang said.

A recent document by the National Energy Administration called for support from local governments for biom
projects, with heating being a priority.

""It is very meaningful to promote biomass for heating especially in counties and rural areas, where there are ab
materials like crops and animal waste. Through cogeneration of heat and power from biomass, and biogas pro
the process of anaerobic fermentation, heating in those areas will have cleaner sources,"" Li said.

China to offer over 2.7 billion subsidies for wind, solar power

By Vera Wang 06/29/2022

 0

On Monday, China’s Ministry of Finance has issued new subsidies worth 2.75 billion
yuan (USD 410 million) for electricity generated from renewable energies.

Workers inspect photovoltaic power generation facilities in Hai'an, East China's
Jiangsu province, on March 15, 2022. Photo-IC

Wind and solar have been allocated with 1.47 billion yuan (USD 220 million) and 1.25
billion yuan (USD 190 million) respectively. The rest 28.9 million will be offered to
biomass energy.

This is the second subsidy package for this year, following the 3.96 billion subsidy
announced at the end of 2021, where 2.28 billion yuan has been offered to solar power.

The subsidy will be distributed to local utilities from 13 provinces and autonomous

regions. Inner Mongolia is the one receiving the largest amount of subsidies.

State Grid Corporation of China and China Southern Power Grid are not eligible for
the subsidies distributed this time.

 
As per the terms of Renewable Energy Law of China, the funds of the subsidy are
collected from the surcharge for electricity generated from renewable energies. It
provides the money for power grid companies to purchase electricity generated from
solar PV, wind, biomass and other renewable energy sources.

At present, China has the world’s largest renewable power fleet with 323 GW of solar

and 338 GW of wind. The country is set to add 108 GW of solar power to the grid this
year, according to Bloomberg.

The subsidies offered this time could further spur the deployment of wind and solar
power in China.
