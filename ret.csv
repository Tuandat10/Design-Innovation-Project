Australia’s Renewable Energy Target (RET) mandates investment in renewable electricity generation
through a renewable energy certiﬁcate market. A legislated national consultative review of the RET was
carried out in 2012, resulting in 8660 submissions. Respondents were invited to comment on the value of
the legislated target, including whether the legislated target should be a ﬁxed GWh target or a ﬁxed
policy-based percentage-of-demand target, and the impact of review processes on the renewable energy
industry. This paper presents the ﬁrst analysis of submissions and evaluates their implications for the
future of this policy. There was a consistent alignment of opinion amongst respondents, with industry
and fossil-fuel generation/retailer groups opposing the RET objectives, whilst these were supported by
NGOs and the renewable sector. However, most respondents favoured maintaining the overall goal of
providing 20% renewable electricity generation by 2020. Concerns were raised by most groups of re-
spondents regarding policy continuity and excessive reviewing procedures. In its response to the review,
the Climate Change Authority made a total of 34 recommendations, 18 maintaining the status quo. Only
six recommendations were endorsed by the Australian Government that would result in changes to the
scheme. It is concluded that such review processes can be signiﬁcantly harmful to maintaining stability
and certainty in an industry requiring long-term commitment for investments, and that the Australian
Government continues to favour the status quo in responding to consultative review processes relating
to renewable energy policies.

1. Introduction e the renewable energy target legislation and
review processes in Australia

The role of renewable energy in replacing incumbent fossil-fuel
generating electricity systems is assuming greater signiﬁcance as
governments are under pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions. The enduring question within the renewable energy policy
framework is how much support (economically and otherwise) the
renewable energy industry requires to thrive.

Australia has had three manifestations of national legislation
aimed at promoting the renewable energy industry and, in turn,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The measurable outcome of
these policies is to see an increase in the proportion of ‘clean’ gen-
eration technologies in the electricity generation mix [1]. This is done
by requiring electricity retailers to source a proportion of the elec-
tricity for their customers from certiﬁed ‘clean’ generators through
the purchase of renewable energy certiﬁcates, encompassing both

large-scale renewable sources such as wind farms and small-scale
sources such as household renewable technologies.

Periodic reviews of the schemes were included as a requirement
of the legislation. The ﬁrst of these reviews was the Tambling Re-
view in 2003, which invited submissions on the functioning of the
initial legislation [1]. Subsequent to the Tambling Review were
frequent additional review processes that considered the legislative
framework, speciﬁc aspects of the legislation and the interaction
between the legislation and other policy initiatives [2]. A review of
the most recent incarnation of the legislation, to be undertaken by
the independent Climate Change Authority, was initiated in August
2012 [1].

These review processes and the broader academic literature
regarding renewable energy certiﬁcates highlight various issues
with the development of such policies. These include the lack of
appropriate consultation processes when developing legislation
[3]; the lack of certainty and consistency in renewable energy
policies, in particular for small-scale renewable energy technolo-
gies [4]; and the on-going commitment to existing policies
favouring the status quo and fossil-fuel generating industries in
particular [5].

Kent and Mercer [6] proposed that the submissions made
available as part of the 2003 Tambling Review provided potentially
the most comprehensive overview of the status of Australia’s
renewable energy sector. Ten years have elapsed since this review,
with changes in Government, relevant legislation and industry over
this time. An assessment of the submissions to the most recent
review of the legislation, the 2012 Climate Change Authority’s re-
view of the RET, therefore provides insight into the current state of
the renewable energy sector and perceptions of renewable legis-
lation and associated policy development processes.

2. Material and methods

The Climate Change Authority undertook a consultative review
process, including the development of an issues paper for general
comment, and a discussion paper that provided a draft of ﬁnal
recommendations for further comment. There were 8660 sub-
missions received in response to the Issues Paper (8500 campaign
submissions and 160 stakeholder submissions), with 54 responses
to the Discussion Paper [1]. Four roundtables and 60 one-on-one
interviews were undertaken over the course of the review process.
This assessment of the Australian Government’s Renewable
Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 legislation and the associated Climate
Change Authority Review of the RET follows a similar approach to
Kent and Mercer’s [6] evaluation of the Tambling Review process.
Submissions to the Climate Change Authority’s Issues Paper were
critically assessed against the questions posed within the Review
Issues Paper. All submissions were assessed according to criteria as
outlined in Kent and Mercer [6], namely the type of stakeholder,
their overall perspective of the legislation (whether they support or
reject its value) and any particular issues of note to the stakeholder.
Particular issues of interest were those surrounding the effects of
uncertainty in the legislation on industry, including in relation to
the GWh target, the effects of continual review processes, and
perceptions of embedded policies favouring other technology
types, including a certiﬁcate multiplier for small-scale photovoltaic
systems. Information on the number of responses to particular
themes was recorded by stakeholder type (peak industry group,
corporation, academic, individual, environmental NGO), with sup-
porting statements provided alongside each respondent’s details.
The Final Review Report was released on 19 December 2012 [7].
The Australian Government’s formal response to recommendations
outlined in the Final Review Report was released on 23 March 2013
[8]. The Climate Change Authority’s recommendations and the
Australian Government’s response to the Climate Change Author-
ity’s Review Report were examined. Analysis of the extent to which
the Australian Government is prepared to undertake modiﬁcations
to the legislation in light of the Climate Change Authority’s ﬁndings
assisted in determining whether the review process is seen as
beneﬁcial to Australia’s renewable energy industry or whether it is
an unnecessary disturbance.

Collection of data for the research was via the Climate Change
Authority website [7], which publishes all calls for submission,
submissions from stakeholders and the Review Report itself. The
Australian Government published its response to the Climate
Change Authority’s Review Report and recommendations
through the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efﬁ-
ciency website [8].

3. Theory e Australia’s RET e targets, legislation and reviews

The ﬁrst of Australia’s renewable energy schemes came into
force in April 2001 under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act
2000 [6]. The key measure of the Act was the initiation of the
Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET), which was to see a 2%

per annum increase to renewable energy generation by 2010, from
a 1996/1997 10.5% baseline. Energy demand forecasts at the time of
setting the target were used to equate the additional 2% renewable
generation to a GWh target, namely 9500 GWh, which was the
legislated target included in the Act.

Periodic reviews of the scheme were included as a requirement
in the legislation. The Tambling Review in 2003 invited sub-
missions on the functioning of the MRET [9]. The review process
determined that an increase in electricity demand between the
scheme’s initiation and the time of review had resulted in the
9500 GWh target equating to less than a 2% increase in renewable
generation. The Review Panel’s recommendations included main-
taining the 9500 GWh target to 2010 and then increasing the target
to 2020 to promote industry investment. The Government sup-
ported the maintenance of the 9500 GWh target but rejected the
proposal to expand the scheme. The Review Panel also considered
amending the legislation to state a ﬁxed percentage target with a
ﬂoating GWh value, as opposed to the ﬁxed GWh target. The Re-
view Panel recommended maintaining a ﬁxed GWh target to
ensure certainty for investors.

In August 2009,

legislation was passed to implement the
expanded national RET, which brought the former MRET and
existing and proposed state and territory schemes into one national
scheme [10]. It expanded the previous MRET to a forecast 20%
contribution to the electricity mix by 2020, set in the legislation as
45,000 GWh. The RET also included speciﬁc support for small-scale,
rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, through the ‘Solar Credits
Multiplier’ [1].

In June 2010, further legislation was passed to separate the
expanded national RET into two parts, the Large-scale Renewable
Energy Target (LRET), covering large-scale projects such as wind
farms, commercial solar and geothermal, and the Small-scale
Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES), covering domestic photovol-
taic, wind turbine and efﬁcient water-heating technologies [1]. The
legislation separated the 45,000 GWh target into 41,000 GWh by
2020 for the LRET and a minimum 4000 GWh by 2020 for the SRES.
The changes were designed to provide greater certainty for large-
scale renewable energy projects, households and installers of
small-scale renewable energy systems.

To date, the MRET and RET have resulted in renewable energy
capacity almost doubling from 10,650 MW in 2001 to 19,700 MW in
2012 [1]. In spite of this, due to an increase in demand for electricity
within Australia, renewable electricity generation as a proportion of
total electricity generation per year has not changed signiﬁcantly
since 2000/01, having grown from approximately 8% to 10%. Wind
and solar photovoltaic (PV) technology make up the majority of new
renewable generation as a result of the MRET and RET [11]. Wind
generation has grown under the RET from 200 GWh in 2000/01 to
5800 GWh in 2010/11. Solar photovoltaic generation has increased
over the same time period from 50 GWh to 850 GWh (Fig. 1).

Under the 2011 updated legislation enacting the RET, the
Climate Change Authority was tasked with completing a review of
the scheme before the end of 31 December 2012 [12]. While the
Climate Change Authority did not have a stipulated Terms of
Reference for undertaking the review, any recommendation put
forward by the Authority may not be inconsistent with the objec-
tives of the Act, which were to a) encourage the additional gener-
ation of electricity from renewable sources; b) reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and c) ensure renewable
energy sources are ecologically sustainable [13].

4. Results and discussion

All of the 160 stakeholder submissions were read and analysed
according to areas of note within the Issues Paper. The 8500

in the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within Australia,
with many citing the Copenhagen Accord’s goal of a 5% reduction in
emissions relative to 2000 by 2020 as a primary driver for the need
to reduce emissions. A handful of respondents also focused on the
need to invest in renewable energy generation to diversify Aus-
tralia’s electricity generation system, avoiding the impacts of
increasing fossil fuel costs associated with ‘peak oil’ and exposure
to international gas markets.

Approximately 14% of respondents to this portion of the Issues
Paper (N ¼ 132) argued for a reduction in the value of the 2020
target to match current demand forecasts. All but one of these re-
spondents were from corporations or industry groups with a
mixed-energy (fossil fuel and renewable) or fossil fuel focus. The
majority of respondents noted increasing electricity costs associ-
ated with the RET as damaging for business and that the Australian
Government should therefore endorse its initial commitment to
‘20% renewable energy by 2020’. Additionally, most stakeholders
stated that the 2012 implementation of a carbon pricing mecha-
nism in Australia meant there was no need for the RET. Re-
spondents stated that the RET should only be maintained to 2020 in
order to ensure investor certainty.

While some renewable-focussed stakeholders supported an
increase to the 2020 target, 89% of them requested that the current
2020 target be maintained (N ¼ 45). This is a counter-intuitive
response given it is renewable-focussed industry that is most
likely to beneﬁt from an increase in the target. A total of 63% of all
respondents requested that the target be maintained (N ¼ 132),
with responses spread across all stakeholder groups except fossil-
fuel based corporations. The reasons for maintaining the target
were varied, with many responses refuting reasons put forward to
reduce the target to updated demand projections. It was noted that
demand forecasting practices are inherently unreliable and that
any number of changes in the future could alter the demand proﬁle.
There was considerable speculation that making signiﬁcant
changes to the RET as a result of the introduction of the carbon
pricing mechanism may be unwise. It was suggested that Austral-
ia’s carbon pricing mechanism may not be able to facilitate in-
vestment in renewable energy as a result of its currently low value,
the exposure of the carbon price to international markets, and most
importantly that the security of the carbon pricing mechanism is
not assured. The Australian Government opposition party has
vowed to abolish the carbon pricing legislation if it gains power
following the September 2013 General Election [14]. Importantly,
respondents noted that the Australian Government’s explicit policy
commitment was to meet ‘at least’ 20% of electricity demands in
2020 through renewable generation, and that this did not provide
for a maximum renewable commitment. Finally, 38% of re-
spondents to this line of questioning (N ¼ 132) stated that the RET
should be maintained at the current target level in order to main-
tain investor conﬁdence.

Interestingly, only 6% of submissions responding to this line of
questioning suggested unequivocally that the RET should be

campaign submissions were derived from two key sources: GetUp,
a grassroots community advocacy group (7806 submissions); and
Hepburn Wind, a co-operative implementing the ﬁrst community-
initiated wind farm in Australia (694 submissions). With each of
these two groups of campaign submissions treated as a single
stakeholder submission, the total number of submissions assessed
was 162 (Table 1).

The following discussion focuses on issues cited most frequently
by industry and the public with regard to the RET and is applicable
to other international renewable certiﬁcate trading mechanisms.

4.1. Real, revised and projected e changes to the RET Target value

A major focus of the RET review was the consideration of
whether the Target should be increased, decreased or maintained
at the current legislated level. The decision to reassess the target
was largely in response to reductions in energy demand forecasts
resulting in the 45,000 GWh target making up approximately 26%
of expected electricity demand by 2020/21 [1]. Reasons cited by
respondents for the reduction in demand included increased small-
scale renewable system installation, installation of energy efﬁcient
appliances, milder summers and winters and changes to the in-
dustrial nature of Australia (closing of manufacturing and pro-
cessing plants).

Approximately 17% of stakeholders responding to this line of
questioning (N ¼ 132) requested an increase in the target to 2020.
Respondents recommending an increase to the target were pri-
marily non-government associations and individuals (17 re-
sponses), and renewable-focus corporations and industry groups (5
responses). The majority of these responses argued for an increase

abolished. All but one of these submissions stated that the main
reason for abolishing the RET was that it was no longer required as a
carbon pricing mechanism had been established, and that the RET
did not provide least-cost abatement. This is in spite of the fact that,
of those respondents stating whether they supported or opposed
the RET, 13% were against its inception. The difference between the
number of stakeholders opposing the RET and the number rec-
ommending its abolition stems from the realisation that the RET
has become a component of the Australian energy market, and that
considerable investment by business has been made with regard to
the RET. Both sides of the RET debate, those supporting and
investing in renewables and those reliant on fossil-fuel generation,
increasingly understand the importance of maintaining investor
conﬁdence in Australia by ensuring stability in policy. Increase in
sovereign risk associated with changes to the RET, even if incre-
mental, were deemed to extend beyond the renewable energy
sector to other areas of the Australian industrial economy.

Kent and Mercer [6] noted that the Tambling Review Panel
recommended maintaining the legislated target to ensure industry
certainty. Additionally, the Australian Government agreed to a GWh
target in Parliament on three separate occasions in 2000 [15], 2008
[16] and 2010 [17]. The reasons behind this conclusion have not
changed, and therefore there is reason to question why the target
was reassessed given it was not speciﬁcally required within the
Climate Change Authority’s remit. The removal of subsection 162(h)
from the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 [18], that the
Review must include consideration of ‘the level of the overall target
and interim targets’, was included within the Renewable Energy
(Electricity) Amendment Act 2009 [19]. Though the explanatory
memorandum makes no speciﬁc mention of why this requirement
was repealed [20], its removal does indicate that consideration of
the target’s value was deemed unnecessary.

Leading up to the initiation of the review process there was
considerable scrutiny of the GWh value of the target within the
Australian media. Media interest was driven in large part by fossil-
fuel based generation corporations and high electricity consumers
noting ﬁnancial
implications associated with the RET [21,22].
Renewable interest groups were then vocally opposed to the
reduction of the target in response to industry demands, citing this
[23,24]. Kent and Mercer’s [6]
as self-interested behaviour
concluding remarks note that respondents will be inherently self-
interested in their contributions to consultative policy develop-
ment processes. The case of stakeholder responses to the target
review is clearly an example of this assertion in practice, with the
power of stakeholders and the media apparently inﬂuencing re-
view panel decisions to the potential detriment of the renewable
energy industry.

4.2. To review or not to review? e frequency of review processes

One of the most repetitive themes within submissions to the
Climate Change Authority Review process was the potentially
damaging impact of the Review process itself. The Review process
was a legislative requirement of the RET scheme, however, the
length of time between implementation of the most recent (2010)
changes to the scheme and the initiation of the Review process was
seen as unnecessarily short. 60% of respondents to the section of
the Issues Paper requesting consideration of the frequency of re-
views (N ¼ 70), from across the full spectrum of stakeholders, noted
that the main concern in relation to future review processes was
the need to maintain policy certainty and ensure minimal disrup-
tion to industry. 77% of stakeholders stated that the legislation
should be amended so that there would be more than two years
between each review process (N ¼ 70). An additional 9% of re-
it was not appropriate to change
spondents indicated that

legislation to increase time between reviews, as this would create
additional investment insecurity, but that the scope of future re-
views should be limited considerably and should be made explicit
well ahead of time. In particular, many respondents noted that
there should be only a long-run ﬁxed review timetable, limited to
determining whether future targets were large enough to support
on-going renewable energy investment, with smaller reviews un-
dertaken only when a certain threshold had been reached, for
instance when the shortfall penalty charge (which acts as a price
ceiling in the certiﬁcate market) was being paid instead of pur-
chasing large-scale renewable certiﬁcates.

The focus of submissions on the length of time between review
processes was unsurprising considering the negative consequences
of concurrent and frequent review processes was noted within the
Tambling Review. The Parer Review, which was undertaken
concurrently with the Tambling Review, examined the most cost-
effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and found
that the MRET was inefﬁcient and that an emissions trading scheme
would result in greater environmental beneﬁts [6]. These review
ﬁndings, and the fact that both review processes were undertaken
concurrently, were found to create a level of uncertainty within the
electricity generation industry. This situation was later echoed with
the ﬁnalisation of the RET legislation reportedly overshadowed by
the release of the White Paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction
Scheme (the Australian Government’s emissions trading scheme)
and associated claims by industry that such a scheme would in-
crease electricity costs [10]. The on-going lack of clarity in the
relationship between review processes, potential subsequent
changes to RET legislation, and the interaction between the RET and
an emissions trading scheme creates long-term uncertainty for
industry.

In addition to the recurring theme of uncertainty surrounding
on-going review processes, stakeholders also noted ‘review fatigue’,
with ten review processes speciﬁcally related to the RET in the last
ﬁve years [2], naught resulting in substantial changes to the policy
framework. The Australian Government’s decision to provide op-
portunities for stakeholder feedback at multiple steps in the devel-
opment of legislation is evidence of its preference for consultative
policy-development processes, a system which is increasingly be-
ing questioned. Crase et al. [25] found that such community
consultation processes may be inefﬁcient as successive consultation
processes may contain unique questions and responses to the extent
that each consultation process must be started anew, without an
opportunity for policy-makers to learn from the outcomes of pre-
vious consultation processes. Contrary to this, the RET Issues Paper
responses indicate that the opposite is true e stakeholders are
growing increasingly frustrated with covering similar material, with
the same outcomes, in on-going review processes. That the previous
review processes have been ineffectual in creating marked change to
the policy environment, for the betterment of industry or with
additional environmental beneﬁts,
indicates that these review
processes are ultimately more likely to result in delays in investment
and industry uncertainty. As one respondent to the Issues Paper put
it, ‘constant review is not reform’ [26].

‘Picking winners’ in renewable energy policy e the solar credits

4.3.
multiplier and other schemes

The Solar Credits Multiplier was introduced to the RET in 2009
by the Australian Government as a replacement for the over-
subscribed $8000 Solar Homes and Communities Grant [1]. In
creating the Solar Credits Multiplier the Australian Government
was able to shift the ﬁnancial burden of the Grant from their own
to electricity consumers. The Australian Government
budget
initially designed the scheme with a ﬁve times multiplier, reducing

132

G. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135

each ﬁnancial year to one [1]. Additionally, each small-scale
photovoltaic system received generation certiﬁcates based on a
forecast 15 year ‘deeming period’ [1]. The combination of the solar
credits multiplier and the deeming period led to an initial upfront
rebate equivalent to 75 years of generation. The 75 years of gen-
eration for a system at the initial certiﬁcate price was equivalent to
approximately $7500 [1], close to the value of the Grant the Solar
Credits Multiplier was replacing.

The Solar Credits Multiplier was credited with increasing uptake
of small-scale solar systems, with 18% of respondents to this line of
questioning noting that the scheme resulted in substantial invest-
ment (N ¼ 68). However, a larger proportion of submissions criti-
cised the use of the policy to stimulate investment. A conﬂuence of
factors was cited as causing the Solar Credits Multiplier scheme to
become oversubscribed, including the initiation of generous state-
based feed-in tariff schemes and increased demand creating scales
of economies that reduced the price of systems. In response to the
increased generation of certiﬁcates associated with the scheme the
Australian Government decreased the multiplier ahead of schedule
on two occasions [1], resulting in uncertainty for the small-scale
solar industry. With regards to the Issues Paper submissions,
three key criticisms of the Solar Credits Multiplier were proposed.

4.3.1.

‘Phantom credits’

The Solar Credits Multiplier was unfavourably received by 18
respondents who noted that the multiplication of ‘real’, deemed
certiﬁcates created ‘phantom credits’: certiﬁcates that did not
equate to actual abatement and yet still contributed to the
achievement of the target. There were even calls by some re-
spondents that the RET target value should be increased to take into
account the generation of phantom credits. The exact number of
phantom credits allocated under the RET between the initiation of
the scheme in 2009 and the ﬁnal generation of credits at the end of
2012 has not been made public. However, data available through
the Clean Energy Regulator indicates that ‘phantom credits’ could
have contributed approximately 66% of the certiﬁcates required to
meet the RET target value between 2009 and 2012 (Table 2).

4.3.2. Boomebust cycles

The reduction of multipliers over time was found to create large
surges in sales prior to the reduction of a multiplier, with house-
holders attempting to take advantage of the higher rebates, fol-
lowed by bust periods with reduced householder investment,
resulting in boomebust cycles noted by nine respondents. Data
available from the Clean Energy Regulator [27] reﬂect the reality of
boomebust cycles, with peaks in small-scale installation rates
coincident with the end of multiplier periods (Fig. 2). The boome
bust cycles were felt doubly by installers e not only were market
sales of small-scale renewable systems experiencing ﬂuctuations in
demand but there were coincident ﬂuctuations in the value of
generation certiﬁcates sold within the RET market. The drastic

reduction in demand for certiﬁcates, and reduction in their value,
led to several members of the small-scale solar industry entering
receivership [30]. One submission also credited reduced installa-
tion quality and education of customers, including appropriate
system choice and system orientation, with installers trying to rush
installations through within higher multiplier time periods [31].

4.3.3. REC overhang

The introduction of phantom credits, combined with the over-
subscription to the scheme, resulted in an excessive number of
certiﬁcates being generated. There were two closely associated
outcomes: the larger than expected number of certiﬁcates gener-
ated through the market resulted in retailers purchasing enough
certiﬁcates to cover their RET liability for several years, reducing
future demand for certiﬁcates. The reduction in demand for cer-
tiﬁcates led to a drop in the market value of certiﬁcates still being
sold through the market, to the extent that the construction of new
large-scale installations is no longer viable. This ‘overhang’ of cer-
tiﬁcates and the devaluation of RECs was noted by 18 respondents.
large-scale renewable energy by
While the crowding-out of
excessive small-scale generation was remedied through the sepa-
ration of the RET into the LRET and SRES, with separate GWh targets
and certiﬁcate types, the REC overhang still exists, with many re-
tailers still stockpiling enough RECs to meet obligations out to
2015/2016, essentially stalling investment in large-scale generation
for the period between 2011 and 2015/16.

Kent and Mercer [6] found that mandating of particular tech-
nologies (through multiple certiﬁcates and excess quotas) was near
unanimously opposed in submissions to the Tambling Review, as it
was deemed as a way of ‘picking winners’ in regards to technology
types as opposed to allowing the most economically efﬁcient
technologies to advance. Claims by small-scale renewable energy
industry in the media that the Solar Credits Multiplier was required
to promote the installation of systems and support the small-scale
industry [32] were ultimately off-set by responses to the Issues
Paper that the Solar Credits Multiplier was inefﬁcient and resulted
in unnecessarily high increases in electricity tariffs. Ross et al. [3]
noted that renewable energy policies that generate high levels of
industry growth over the short-term, but cannot be sustained
ﬁnancially, undermine long-term industry development. Further-
more, Valentine [33] indicated that the Solar Credits Multiplier was
harmful to the renewable energy sector in that it allowed small-

shown to increase the demand for small-scale solar photovoltaic
systems to the extent that economies of scale were achieved, but it
was also found to have negative, cascading effects across the
renewable energy market and to all electricity consumers. That 87%
of respondents referring to this line of question (N ¼ 68) either
rejected the use of multipliers (or banding) in future, and/or noted
the negative impacts of the Solar Credits Multiplier to the scheme,
indicates that the Solar Credits Multiplier was ultimately delete-
rious to the RET scheme. Approximately 19% of respondents sup-
ported the use of multipliers (or banding), and then only in speciﬁc
cases where generation of certiﬁcates was likely to be low, with
many of these respondents also noting that the Solar Credits
Multiplier had resulted in undesirable outcomes in the RET.

4.3.4.

Incumbent support for other technology types

There was considerable criticism within Issues Paper sub-
missions regarding the inclusion of two additional support mech-
anisms for technologies. The inclusion of waste coal mine gas
received particular criticism from respondents,
in particular
because this is not an ‘ecologically sustainable’ renewable energy
source, as is stipulated in the RET legislation. The inclusion of waste
coal mine gas is as a result of the harmonisation of jurisdictional
targets prior to the 2009 expansion of the RET [1], including New
South Wales’ support for waste coal mine gas. As only waste coal
mine gas generation systems built in New South Wales during its
target scheme are supported competitive inequity exists between
generators wanting to utilise waste coal mine gas. 64% of the re-
spondents to this line of questioning (N ¼ 42) explicitly requested
its removal from the RET, with only two respondents requesting
that new waste coal mine gas be capable of generating certiﬁcates
under the RET. The remainder of respondents all proposed main-
taining the current arrangements, to provide on-going support to
existing facilities or simply to ensure that the legislative framework
remained unchanged.

The inclusion of technologies that do not generate electricity but
may displace the use of electricity e so-called displacement tech-
nologies e was an area of contention within submissions, with 42%
of respondents to this line of questioning supporting displacement
technologies’ removal from the scheme, and 39% supporting its
expansion to other technology types (N ¼ 31). The 2001 MRET
included support for small-scale solar water heaters and heat pump
in these
water heaters as a way of promoting investment

manufacturing industries in Australia [34]. While the majority of
these systems are now imported into Australia the legacy of sup-
porting this industry, particularly in light of its contribution to
energy efﬁcient technology uptake, has led to the view that support
for this industry is still useful. The inclusion of solar water heaters
and heat pump water heaters in the RET continues to be conten-
tious, not only for the fact that these are not renewable electricity
generation resources, but also because new displacement tech-
nologies, in particular cogeneration and ground source heat pumps,
are not included in the RET.

The lack of alternative schemes to appropriately support waste
coal mine gas generation and displacement technologies, and
continuing concern that the carbon pricing mechanism may prove
inadequate or be revoked, led the Climate Change Authority to
recommend retaining both mechanisms, with the outcome that
inequity will continue to exist between waste coal mine gas gen-
erators and elements of the displacement industry.

Lindblom’s [35]

‘disjointed incrementalism’, where policy-
makers pursue a limited range of well-analysed policy alterna-
tives, is particularly relevant in this case, which sees an inherently
conservative approach to policy-making preferred. Kent and
Mercer [6] found this policy development technique was typiﬁed in
the development of the former Liberal (conservative) Govern-
ment’s MRET. Consistent with the incremental policy development
process, the Liberal Australian Government’s response to the
Tambling Review’s ﬁndings had emphasised a ‘business-as-usual’
policy framework, with fossil-fuel continuing to dominate the en-
ergy sector in future. In this case the Climate Change Authority has
also favoured a ‘business-as-usual’ policy framework that favours
both the incumbent renewable generators, but also support
mechanisms that may not serve the objectives of the RET to provide
least-cost renewable generation.

4.4. Climate change authority review recommendations and
government response

On completing the consultation process, the Climate Change
Authority produced a Final Review Report that included 34 rec-
ommendations for the Australian Government’s consideration [1].
Of these 34 recommendations, 18 supported the existing scheme,
ﬁve recommended further review, consultation or assessment and
11 proposed changes to the scheme (Table 3). Of these 11 only six

were accepted outright, with three of these accepted recommen-
dations covering minor administrative components of the scheme
[8]. The key recommendation accepted by the Australian Govern-
ment conﬁrmed that the periodical review process would be un-
dertaken only once every four years. The other recommendation
with appreciable effects on the renewable energy industry related
to the decision to reduce the deeming of certiﬁcates from 15 years,
however this will not come into effect until 2017.

The review process therefore supported relatively incremental
changes to the policy. Given no great changes have been suggested
to promote increased uptake of renewable energy, or conversely to
provide additional support for electricity consumers suffering un-
der the burden of the RET, the review process is likely to have
caused more harm than good purely by introducing a perception of
policy uncertainty. While the outcomes of the review process
suggest that the Climate Change Authority has taken heed of the
advice from industry to minimise changes to the scheme, and the
Australian Government has gone one step further to maintain the
status quo within the Scheme, there may be value in determining
whether the Review should have been undertaken at all, particu-
larly given the Australian Government’s apparent preference for
maintaining the status quo in the majority of review processes.

The case of the 2012 Climate Change Authority Review of the
RET, and the Australian Government’s response, could therefore be
considered ‘choreographed consultation’. Cheeseman and Smith
[36] found that a consultative policy-development process resulted
in little actual inﬂuence on policy direction, but that the consulta-
tion process garnered support for policies already in train. If any-
thing, the RET review process allowed the Australian Government
to cite support from a variety of stakeholders, including industry
and the general public, with regard to the implementation of pol-
icies to support renewable energy in Australia. In doing so, the
Australian Government was able to rebuke claims from industry
that it would be in Australian consumers’ best interests to support a
decrease to the 45,000 GWh target.

5. Conclusion

The submissions to the RET Issues Paper demonstrate that
while the RET mechanism is increasing the penetration of
renewable technologies within Australia, and stakeholders,
including industry and the general public, are largely supportive of
the Scheme, there are misgivings about some elements of the
operation of the Scheme. Primarily, stakeholders perceive that the
RET would be more successful if it was devoted to least-cost
renewable technologies, and therefore sub-schemes that favour
technology types should not be included under the Scheme. The
overwhelming conclusion that can be drawn from the sub-
missions, however, is that uncertainty within the policy environ-
ment remains the key threat to meeting the RET scheme Target.
This uncertainty is felt through the unknown interaction between
the RET and the carbon pricing mechanism, the frequent intro-
duction of review processes that undermine investment certainty
and the interaction between state-based policies and the renew-
able energy industry. The necessity of ensuring a set GWh target
for the RET, and providing conﬁdence to investors that this will
not be amended, regardless of future potential review processes,
cannot be overstated. While the Climate Change Authority’s
recommendation to maintain the current GWh target, and in-
crease the time between reviews from two years to four years,
goes some way to increasing conﬁdence within the renewable
energy industry, the potential renegotiation of the target and re-
review of the Scheme should the Australian Government change
hands in September 2013, undermines these efforts. In order for
there to be true conﬁdence in the Target, bipartisan support of the

RET, and implementation of all agreed recommendations of the
Climate Change Authority, is required.

Distributional effects

The Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET) has spurred signiﬁcant investment in renewable
electricity generation, notably wind power, over the past decade. This paper considers distributional
implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the
increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity
prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers
in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our ﬁndings highlight likely signiﬁcant redistributive
transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some
energy-intensive industries are beneﬁting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely
exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying
signiﬁcant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily beneﬁting from lower wholesale prices. A more
equitable distribution of RET costs and beneﬁts could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of
industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in
regulated electricity tariffs reﬂect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these ﬁndings
support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional
assessments into policy design and implementation.

Introduction

Australia implemented the world's ﬁrst national Mandatory
Renewable Energy Target (MRET) based around green certiﬁcate
trading in 2001. The original target of an additional 9500 GWh of
‘new’ renewable generation each year by 2010 was comfortably
achieved with contributions from biomass, hydro, solar and,
most particularly, wind deployment. Amendments to the scheme
undertaken in 2009–10 with bipartisan political support, have
established the goal of deriving the equivalent of at least 20 per

cent of Australian electricity from renewable sources by 2020
(Australian Government, 2012). In 2011, the target was split into
two parts with separate targets, the Large-Scale Renewable Energy
Target (LRET) covering utility scale renewable projects, and the
Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) covering residential
solar. In this paper, we focus on the LRET and associated invest-
ment in (predominantly) wind energy.1

1 The SRES and the associated build-up of distributed photovoltaic electricity
generation in Australia is likely to also have non-negligible distributional effects,
the estimation of which is also impacted by the various State-based feed-in-tariffs
that supported PV's initial deployment (Nelson et al., 2011). Furthermore, the
amount of self-generated solar energy consumed by households owning rooftop PV
also plays a role (Cai et al., 2013).

The RET places a legal obligation on entities that purchase
electricity on the wholesale market to surrender a certain amount
of green certiﬁcates each year in proportion to their market share.
The liable parties are mainly retailers (also known as suppliers and
Load Service Entities in some other industries) and a few large
electricity consumers that directly purchase electricity on the
wholesale market. Each certiﬁcate represents 1 MWh of electricity
generated by ‘new’ (that is, not pre-existing hydro) renewable
energy sources. These Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs) can be
created by accredited large-scale renewable energy projects, gen-
erating LGCs (and small-scale renewable energy systems for the
SRES). RECs provide the additional revenue stream, beyond energy
market returns, that is required to implement renewable energy
projects. There is an active market between liable parties and
certiﬁcate providers for these RECs with associated spot and
forward prices that vary according to renewable energy project
costs and electricity prices.

Since its inception the RET has driven considerable investment
in renewable energy projects, and an increasing percentage of
electricity consumption is now being provided from new renew-
able generation (Fig. 1). This expansion of electricity generated by
renewables has several competing impacts on electricity prices in
the short run. On the one hand, an increased penetration of
renewables in wholesale electricity markets tends to lower the
spot price. This is due to the so-called merit order effect by which
renewables that have close to zero short run marginal costs
displace higher operating cost generation and hence lower the
overall price required for supply to meet demand within the
wholesale electricity market (see Section 2).

On the other hand, the cost of green certiﬁcates, reﬂecting the
additional investment costs of renewable generation, is added to
the retail price of electricity by the retailer who passes the costs of
complying with their target on to consumers, or is paid for directly
by users who manage their own compliance. Besides a wholesale
component and renewable energy scheme charges, residential
retail prices also include charges for transmission and distribution
networks. These network costs are, indeed, the major cost com-

components for transmission networks of 8% and distribution

networks of 37%, a wholesale component including carbon costs
of 37% and a retail component of 17% that included an allowance
for LRET and SRES costs of 3–4% (Fig. 2).

Our analysis focuses on those components of retail prices
which are directly affected by the RET in the short term, namely
the wholesale component and green scheme charges. We do not
consider transmission or distribution network charges in the
analysis. Instead, the aim of this paper is to investigate how the
potential ﬁnancial beneﬁts of the RET (lower wholesale prices in
the short run) and its costs (increased retail prices due to the cost
of green certiﬁcates) are distributed amongst different groups of
electricity consumers, and how design choices about the imple-
mentation of the RET affect this distribution.
In particular, a
number of so-called energy-intensive trade-exposed industries
are largely exempt from contributing to the costs of the RET, while
they could still beneﬁt from the reduction in wholesale prices
driven by the scheme. The importance of this question has been
noted by some stakeholders. For example, in their submission to
the review of the RET, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory
Tribunal of New South Wales notes: “As the overall RET target is
kept constant, these exemptions raise the costs of complying with
the scheme for all other customers, particularly as the exempted
industries can be large users of electricity and account for a
signiﬁcant proportion of electricity use in Australia. To date, little
analysis has been publicly provided on the impact of these
exemptions including the costs and beneﬁts to other electricity
customers.” (IPART, 2012b, p. 11). The Climate Institute (2012) has
also raised concerns regarding these wealth transfers.

Germany and its Renewable Energy Support Act (EEG). The EEG
also exempts energy-intensive companies from contributing to the
cost of the policy. In their paper Cludius et al. (2013) conclude that
the merit order effect likely overcompensates energy-intensive
consumers by a factor of twenty for their contribution to the cost
of the EEG. This, therefore, makes the scheme more costly than it
might otherwise be for households and small business.

We expect that the Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET)
has also led to potentially signiﬁcant distributional transfers
between households and large electricity consumers. As noted

above, a large share of industrial consumption is currently partially
exempt from complying with the RET. Furthermore, ﬁnancial RET
beneﬁts to end-users – lower wholesale prices – may not be
completely passed forward to households through the process of
setting retail tariffs by regulators. Analysing and addressing dis-
tributional effects can play a key role in achieving broad social
consensus on the fairness and hence appropriateness of policy
implementation (United Nations, 2006). As an example, the
Australian Government introduced a large household assistance
programme alongside its introduction of a carbon price with the
explicit intent of addressing potentially adverse distributional
impacts arising from the policy, particularly on vulnerable house-
holds (Australian Government, 2011).

Distributional issues, however, did not seem to feature greatly
in public discussions regarding the design and implementation of
the extended RET (MacGill and Passey, 2009). More recently,
however, major rises in retail electricity prices have focussed
greater public attention on cost drivers within the industry. Most
of these price increases have been driven by growing distribution
network expenditure. However, renewable energy policy support
including the RET has also contributed and raised questions of
overall schemes costs and also their distribution. Discussions are
set to intensify in the future as LRET costs are expected to rise, as a
result of both the progressively increasing level of the target
(obligations on retailers to source their electricity from renewable
sources are currently expected to more than double over the next
six years)2 and rising LGC prices due to higher ﬁnancing costs for
renewables projects (IPART, 2013). Furthermore, an abolition of the
carbon price and an associated fall in wholesale electricity prices
would also be expected to drive up prices for LGCs. Finally, results
of this study not only have implications for the RET, but also, more
generally, for ongoing discussions about the potential need and
possible nature of reform of both electricity wholesale and retail
markets in Australia.

The paper is structured as follows. We ﬁrst present the method
and data for estimation of the merit order effect of wind energy in

the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We also discuss
the market for Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates, reﬂecting the costs
of the RET and point out existing exemptions from the RET. Finally,
we present a framework for determining the net impact of the RET
on electricity prices. Section 3 presents regression results of the
reduction in wholesale prices caused by the merit order effect of
wind in the Australian NEM in 2011–12 and 2012–13. We use
these results together with information on RET costs in regulated
retail tariffs to derive impacts of the RET on retail electricity prices
for a range of pass-through rates for both the reduction in whole-
sale prices and RET costs. Section 4 discusses potential effects for
individual electricity consumers and how these are related to the
retail tariffs they receive. Finally, Section 5 highlights the potential
policy implications of these ﬁndings and concludes.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Estimating the merit order effect of wind in the Australian
National Electricity Market (NEM)

The expansion of renewable generation in the NEM, in particular
the large growth in wind capacity since the inception of policies
promoting renewable generation, has had a notable inﬂuence on
the price of wholesale electricity. As with any additional supply, the
expansion of wind generation has placed downward pressure on
wholesale prices. However, this phenomenon is more pronounced
in the case of wind generation due to the fact that it has a very low
short run marginal cost. This systematic correlation between spot
price and wind generation in the short run is known as the merit
order effect of wind generation.

The supply curve, or merit order, within a wholesale electricity
market is constructed by ordering the bids of all generators from
lowest to highest. In a scenario where no market power exists
these bids should equate to the marginal costs of the generators
and therefore the supply curve reﬂect the aggregate marginal cost
curve for the market. At the intersection of the supply and demand
curves, the spot market price is set. All generators with lower marginal
costs receive this uniform price and serve demand over the period of
the wholesale spot market, which lasts half an hour in the NEM. Wind
tends to shift the supply curve to the right, due to its low marginal cost

of generation. This is called the merit order effect (see Forrest and
MacGill, 2013 for an in-depth discussion of the merit order effect).3

The merit order effect is a well-documented phenomenon (IEA,
2011). In general, two ways of estimating the effect exist. The ﬁrst
approach uses an electricity market model which compares two
scenarios, one with and one without the inclusion of renewables
and looks at the difference in resulting electricity wholesale prices
(de Miera et al., 2008; Sensfuß et al., 2008; Weigt, 2009). The
second approach uses time-series analysis of historical price and
load data (Cludius et al., 2013; Forrest and MacGill, 2013; Gelabert
et al., 2011; Jónsson et al., 2010; Woo et al., 2011). While the
speciﬁcation of an electricity market model has the potential to
capture longer term effects, it requires careful calibration of a
counterfactual scenario and available market models generally
have signiﬁcant limitations. Time-series analysis, on the other
hand, does not have to make assumptions about alternative
developments, but can only analyse short term effects, neglecting
issues such as investment costs in new generation or networks. It
may also struggle to resolve the impact of renewables against a
wide range of other potential market drivers. Some techniques can
include elements of both approaches (McConnell et al., 2013). See
Würzburg et al. (2013) for a review of studies on the merit order
effect to date.

forward market,

The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) includes the
states of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia
and Tasmania (the Australian Capital Territory is included in the
NSW region of the NEM). It covers around 90% of Australia's
population and electricity demand. The wholesale spot market is
unique in that it is ‘energy only’ with no capacity market or
technical
is compulsory (gross pool) for all
generators larger than 30 MW, uses ﬁve minute dispatch with
30 minute averaged pricing, requires participants to manage their
own unit commitment and allows participants to rebid their price-
quantity offers on a ﬁve minute basis (MacGill, 2010). The NEM
spot market is characterised by its extremely volatile prices by
comparison with many other markets and during the study period
operated under a market ceiling price in any half hour
of $12,900/MWh and a market ﬂoor price of (cid:3) $1000/MWh.
At present, each of the regions in the NEM has only limited
interconnection with other regions and therefore each region has
its own dynamic wholesale price (AER, 2012).

The calculation builds on Forrest and MacGill (2013) who
calculate the merit order effect between 2009 and 2011 for South
Australia and Victoria. We extend this analysis by calculating the
merit order effect for the NEM as a whole for the two years 2011–
12 and 2012–13. The wholesale price in the NEM is modelled as a
the feed-in of wind (windt) and total demand
function of

3 Note that depending on the way in which renewable generation is included
in the electricity market, it might also be represented as a reduction in demand.
The overall effect in this stylised model, however, is identical.

account of the fact that the effect of wind is expected to be higher
at the high demand end. Dummy variables for seasonal trends on a
daily timescale and a binary variable for weekends is also
included. To account for transient changes, an autoregressive term
is included in the model (Eq. (1)).

We use half-hourly data on wholesale spot prices, demand and
wind aggregated across the ﬁve regions of the NEM. The data was
extracted from the database located on the Australia Energy Market
Operator (AEMO) website (www.aemo.com.au). A national wholesale
spot price variable was created using a demand weighted average of
the regional prices (Table 1) while demand and wind were added
across regions (Table 2). For each of the data series used in the analysis
the Phillips–Perron test for stationarity was conducted and all series
were found to be stationary as expected, thus alleviating the concern
of spurious regression results.

At high levels of demand, price spikes can be observed that do not
correspond to marginal costs and are the result of a lack of competi-
tion in these situations (Twomey and Neuhoff, 2010). Therefore, the
spot price variable has been censored to between the values of
1 $/MWh and 415 $/MWh, reﬂecting a reasonable estimate of the
lowest and highest short run marginal costs of generators in the NEM.
Consequently, the estimate of the merit order effect can be considered
to be representative of ‘standard’ conditions in the market and not
those periods effected by extremely low and high price events. It is
expected that this approach leads to a more conservative estimate of
the merit order effects due to the asymmetric magnitude and
frequency of low and high price events. Further, by taking a national
approach, we determine an estimate of the merit order effect of the
NEM as a whole, and neglect potential interregional differences and
interconnection effects.

Average half-hourly demand was about 400 MW lower in 2012–13
than in 2011–12, which can be explained by a range of reasons, such as
weather conditions, a rising share of distributed energy sources and

industrial shutdowns (IES, 2013). Average electricity generated by
wind increased by 100 MW. Wholesale spot electricity prices, how-
ever, nearly doubled between 2011–12 and 2012–13. The main driver
of this difference is the introduction of the ﬁxed carbon price in July
2012, and, to a lesser extent, the fact that moderate weather conditions
and signiﬁcant hydro availability coupled with falling demand and
increased feed-in of renewables made 2011–12 a year of historically
low wholesale prices. Retail prices rose by 15% between the two years,
with the wholesale component including the carbon price being
responsible for 38% of this price rise, and rising transmission and
distribution network costs for 43% (AEMC, 2013b).

2.2. The market for Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs), RET costs
and exemptions

Each year, liable parties under the RET – that is, those that
make “relevant acquisitions of electricity” – have to submit a
mandated number of certiﬁcates. In practice these liable parties
are mostly retailers, although there are some end-users that
acquire their obligation directly from renewable energy projects
(Climate Change Authority, 2012). The exact number of certiﬁcates
to be submitted is determined by the Renewable Power Percen-
tage (RPP), which is applied to the amount of electricity bought by
each liable party. The percentage is set at a level that ensures the
20% target of the RET will be reached in 2020. The shortfall charge
is set at 65 $/MWh. As certiﬁcate purchases are tax deductible,
while the shortfall charge is not, the penalty is larger in real terms.
Each Renewable Energy Certiﬁcate (REC) represents 1 MWh of
electricity generated by accredited renewable energy projects. Fig. 3
shows the evolution of spot prices for Large-scale Generation Certiﬁ-
cates (LGCs) for the time period under investigation. LGC prices have
fallen from around $40 in mid-2011 to below $35 in mid-2013.
In theory, certiﬁcate prices should reﬂect the difference between the
price of electricity that can be earned on the wholesale market and the
long run marginal cost of the most economically efﬁcient renewable
generation technology. The price is, however, also inﬂuenced by
political events impacting the current and expected stringency of
renewable energy policy. Nelson et al. (2013) note that prices have
generally been lower than this expected difference. This is mainly due
to uncertainty regarding the future of the RET and an oversupply of
permits that occurred due to a multiplier for credits generated by

small-scale solar, which had been introduced in 2009 when the target
was expanded. This oversupply was one of the reasons for splitting the
target into the two different components in 2011.

Two types of exemptions from liability under the RET exist: (i) self-
consumption and (ii) Emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry
(EITE). Since the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) and therefore
the impact of RET costs on electricity prices depends on the total liable
electricity consumption, the more exemptions, the more expensive the
scheme becomes for the non-exempt parties: “The broader the base
for liability, the smaller the impact for any individual liable party. For
it is generally more efﬁcient and equitable to keep
this reason,
exemptions to a minimum.” (Climate Change Authority, 2012)

The original MRET had a clearly articulated principle that energy
consumers should pay according to their consumption (Tambling,
2003). However, exemption provisions were introduced together with
the expansion of the RET in 2009 and took effect in 2010. Eligible
activities can apply for partial exemption certiﬁcates (PECs). PECs
remove RET liability for the volume of electricity (in MWh) which is
speciﬁed in the PEC. Those PECs are then passed on from the exempt
user to their retailer under the assumption that the retailer then has
lower liability and passes only a fraction of RET costs on to the EITE
activity.

The rationale behind exempting certain industries is that some
industries compete within an international market and thus may
not be able to pass RET costs on to consumers in the form of higher
prices. Consumers might, instead, substitute their product with
one produced by a company that does not face environmental
regulations in their country. Furthermore, industry might decide
to relocate to jurisdictions with less stringent environmental
regulation. This process of shifting greenhouse related emissions
abroad is called ‘carbon leakage’. The true extent of carbon leakage
depends on both the emissions- and trade-intensity of
the
industry in question and other barriers that might impede reloca-
tion of production or substitution of consumption, such as trans-
portation costs or local factors (Dröege et al., 2009; European
Commission, 2010).

The list of EITE activities that qualify for RET exemption is the
same as for exemptions from the Australian carbon price. Highly
emissions-intensive activities include aluminium and zinc smelt-
ing, petroleum reﬁning, the manufacture of iron and steel and the
manufacture of newsprint. They are exempt from 90% of RET costs.

Moderately emissions-intensive activities include the manufacture
of wood, paper and glass products, as well as certain chemical
processes and are exempt for 60% of their electricity consumption.
In 2011, 27.5 TWh of electricity consumption were exempt from
paying for RET costs, mostly at a 90% rate, while in 2012 33.5 TWh
were exempt, which corresponds to about 15% of total electricity
consumption in Australia. 65% of these exemptions were granted
to the aluminium industry (Table 3).4

2.3. Estimating the net impact of the RET on electricity prices

The net effect of

the RET on electricity prices faced by
consumers in the short run depends on the pass-through of both
the merit order effect and the certiﬁcate cost. We estimate
indicative net effects for nine combinations of possible pass-
through rates as illustrated in Table 4. Analysed pass-through
rates of RET costs range from 100% to 10%, corresponding to the
exemption rates (0% for households and small business; 60% or
90% for energy-intensive industry), while the pass-through effect
of the merit order effect is analysed at indicative levels of 0%, 50%
and 100% (representing a case where electricity prices are not,
partially or fully aligned to wholesale price movements).

Pass-through of the merit order effect to an individual con-
sumer depends on whether or not retail prices or tariffs are
aligned to wholesale price movements. The extent to which this
is the case is expected to depend on (i) whether a user is subject to
a regulated retail tariff or has the ability to negotiate their own
contract and, in case the user is on a retail tariff, (ii) the method by
which the wholesale energy purchase cost allowance is calculated
by the regulator in the user's jurisdiction.

The pass-through of RET costs is likely to primarily depend on
the extent of exemption from RET costs of the individual con-
sumer, therefore, we analyse pass-through of RET costs at 10%
(exempt industry, high exemption), 40% (exempt industry, med-
ium exemption) and 100% (no exemption, households and small
business).
the
approach taken by the regulator to determine the green scheme
allowance will again play a role.

In jurisdictions with regulated retail prices,

3. Results

3.1. The impact of the RET on prices in the Australian National
Electricity Market (NEM)

This section presents results of the regression model for the
two years 2011–12 and 2012–13 respectively (Tables 5 and 6).
The years were analysed separately due to the introduction of the
carbon price and its impact on wholesale prices. In order to
account for the fact that the data has been censored a Tobit model
has been used to estimate the parameter coefﬁcients in the model.
Furthermore, due to the possible presence of serial correlation,

4 Exemptions are not granted for the MRET share of the RET, i.e. for the ﬁrst
9500 GWh everyone is fully liable. If this provision was removed, it would add
another 0.36 $/MWh to RET costs for remaining liable parties (Climate Change
Authority, 2012).

statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by looking at the maximum of
standard errors from the Tobit model and an OLS model with
Newey–West standard errors.

All coefﬁcients are estimated highly precisely and have the
expected sign, i.e. additional generation by wind has a negative
impact on the electricity price, while additional demand has a
positive impact. The coefﬁcients can be used to estimate the expected
price reduction at a speciﬁc wind output. From these results, it is
possible to develop an estimate of the total merit order effect, i.e. the
average price reduction by calculating the volume weighted average
price difference over the analysis period (see Forrest and MacGill
(2013) for further information on the estimation strategy).

This represents a short run estimate of the merit order effect, as
it does not take into account long run changes in generation
capacity due to additional wind generation. The estimate of the
merit order effect in 2012–13 is higher by approximately $1/MWh.
This is a result of higher wind penetration and the introduction of
the carbon price leading to higher operating costs of the marginal
generation that wind displaces.5

3.2. RET costs in regulated retail tariffs

Retailers pass the costs incurred by purchasing Renewable Energy
Certiﬁcates (RECs) on to consumers in the form of higher electricity
prices.6 In jurisdictions where retail prices are regulated, regulators
have to set a green scheme allowance for prices to be set by the
retailer. In order to determine the green scheme allowance, jurisdic-
tions apply the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) in a given year to
the expected Large-scale Generation Certiﬁcate (LGC) price. Jurisdic-
tions use different approaches to estimate the expected LGC price.
Some base their estimations on the observed prices of LGCs on the
market (Queensland, the ACT and Tasmania) while others use an
electricity market model to derive the least cost option of reaching
RET targets (New South Wales, South Australia).

LRET allowances for retail prices set in 2011–12 and 2012–13 in
the different State and Territory jurisdictions are shown in Table 7.
For New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and
the ACT, allowances shown are those set by the respective
regulator for regulated retail tariffs. The retail electricity market
is deregulated in Victoria, but retailers have to publish a standing
offer price, which the Australian Electricity Market Commission
(AEMC, 2013b) uses to calculate an indicative component of LRET
costs in retail prices.

As an indicator for LRET costs, a volume-weighted average
using residential electricity consumption by State from ESAA
(2013) of the allowance for LRET costs in regulated retail tariffs
(Table 7) is calculated at 3.38 $/MWh in 2011–12 and 5.29 $/MWh
in 2012–13. This estimate represents LRET costs for households
and small business, as covered by regulated retail tariffs. It has to
be noted that cost recovery in a regulated electricity tariff may
overstate the costs of green certiﬁcates and not represent compe-
titive market prices. Indeed, some of the approaches used by NEM
jurisdictions to determine this allowance have led to estimated
LRET certiﬁcate prices that are considerably higher than the
observed spot market price. Therefore, LRET costs for industry

5 While our analysis focusses on the effect of the Large-scale RET and
associated wind generation, the recent rise in photovoltaic generation installed in
the NEM (as a result of the SRES and State-based feed-in tariffs) is also expected to
have considerable merit order effects (cf. McConnell et al., 2013, who model the
hypothetical impact of 5 GW of distributed photovoltaic generation installed in the
NEM in 2009 to 2010).

6 Therefore, in a concentrated market like Australia, retailers generally do not
have an incentive to minimise RET costs. That is why some large users would like to
opt into the scheme and manage their liabilities directly (Climate Change Authority,
2012).

Table 8 displays indicative net effects per MWh for the different
combinations of pass-through rates. Our results for 2011–12 and
2012–13 indicate that individual consumers situated in the upper
left-hand corner with high pass-through rates of RET cost and low
pass-through rates of the merit order effect faced net costs, while
individual electricity consumers that were shielded from RET costs
and see high pass-through of merit order effects are likely to have
experienced net beneﬁts. Costs for remaining consumers could have
been reduced if those consumers experiencing net beneﬁts from
the policy contributed to a larger extent to the cost of the RET.

Larger effects in 2012–13 can both be attributed to the expan-
sion of wind capacity and the introduction of the carbon price,
which increased the marginal cost of electricity generation

displaced by wind and therefore merit order effects (see Section 3.1),
as well as higher LGC prices in regulated retail tariffs as used in
this analysis. In general, higher wholesale prices should lead to
lower prices for renewable certiﬁcates. This is the case, because
the certiﬁcate price covers the cost difference between what can
be earned on the electricity market by a renewable generator
and what it costs to build it. However, regulator estimations for
renewable certiﬁcates were increased between 2011–12 and 2012–
13, since alternative assumptions regarding the cost of capital
(WACC) were applied. This is partly due to uncertainty surrounding
the political future of renewable energy policy in Australia (cf. Nelson
et al., 2013).

Overall, estimated merit order effects in 2011–12 and 2012–13
are not high enough to fully compensate every electricity con-
sumer for their cost contribution to the RET. However, merit order
effects do have the potential to signiﬁcantly reduce RET costs if
they are passed forward to consumers. Note that this effect might
not hold in the long run, as the effect of increased renewable
generation on wholesale electricity prices in the long run depends
on its effect on investment and divestment decisions in the
electricity industry and, more generally, future electricity market
design.

4. Discussion

As stated above, the net effect of the RET on an individual
consumer, i.e. their position on Table 8, is likely to depend on
certain consumer characteristics. In this section we explore further
consumer characteristics that inﬂuence (i) the pass-through of
merit order effects and (ii) the pass-through of RET costs and the
role of regulators in those jurisdictions with regulated retail prices.

4.1. Pass-through of merit order effects

The pass-through of merit order effects depends on the extent
to which electricity prices of consumers are aligned to wholesale
prices. Large users typically obtain negotiated and often tailored
contracts with retailers within the competitive market. These
tailored contracts may include signiﬁcantly longer time periods
than the standard one to three year contracts for small customers
and can potentially include varying levels of wholesale spot price
exposure depending on the energy user's particular requirements,
risk appetite and load curtailment opportunities. The contracts are
often based on forward prices. However, forward prices should
generally respond to merit order effects as well, as otherwise
arbitrage between the two contracts would be possible (Sensfuß,
2011). At present, future wholesale prices are generally ﬂat or even
lower than current spot prices as market participants expect a
reduction or elimination of the carbon price.

Residential and small business consumers, on the other hand,
are subject to regulated or competitive market offers from retai-
lers. Determinations of regulated tariffs are available online from
the regulatory authority in each State. Information for contracts for
small consumers that are not on a regulated tariff is hard to obtain.
The AEMC notes that unregulated contracts for small consumers
“will generally be lower than regulated or standing offers” (AEMC,
2013b p. 23).

Generally, two different approaches are used by regulators to
determine the wholesale component of a regulate tariff: (i) a Long
run marginal cost (LRMC) approach and (ii) a market-based
approach. The LRMC can be modelled using a number of different
approaches, including the standalone approach, the average incre-
mental cost (AIC) approach and the perturbation (or Turvey)
approach. The standalone approach assumes that no generation
capacity currently exists and therefore, that demand is met by
constructing new generation capacity in a least cost manner to
meet the demand. The standalone approach is popular amongst
regulators in Australia due to its relative simplicity and because it
can be readily applied to different demand proﬁles. In particular,
its applicability to different demand proﬁles means that the LRMC
can be calculated for customers for individual distribution areas
using their respective load proﬁles.

The AIC and perturbation approach both utilise electricity
market investment models to produce estimates of the LRMC.
The AIC approach estimates the LRMC by determining the average
costs of meeting all future increases in demand. The AIC can be
volatile or possibly undeﬁned when future demand is not strictly
increasing. The perturbation approach estimates the LRMC in a
given year by ‘perturbing’ demand with a permanent increase and
ﬁnding the average costs to meet this perturbation.

Market-based energy purchase costs are estimated by forecast-
ing spot and contract prices and then estimating an effective
hedging strategy for the load that the respective retailers serve.
Alternatively, a hedging strategy can be applied to observed prices
in the futures market. From this the total costs of purchasing
electricity are calculated as the cost of purchasing a hedged
position in the market.

The different modelling strategies applied by the regulators in
New South Wales and Queensland in 2011–12 and 2012–13 are
summarised in Table 9. Generally, energy purchase cost results are
higher using a standalone LRMC approach than a market-based
approach. One reason for this difference is that each approach to
estimating the LRMC implicitly incorporates the merit order effect
to a different extent and the extent is often driven by the
assumptions used in undertaking the modelling, in particular the
treatment of
the Renewable Energy Target. The standalone
approach, as it is typically applied, does not include the effect of
renewable generation on price. Typical modelling using the
standalone approach assumes that demand must be met by a
mix of coal- and gas-ﬁred generation and ignores renewable

generation sources, such as wind, as they are not cost competitive
in the absence of the RET (Frontier Economics, 2011). In their
review on best practice retail price methodology, the AEMC
(2013a) notes that a perturbation LRMC method produces “useful
insights” into the interaction between the LRET and the wholesale
electricity price, while the AIC and standalone methods are less
likely to do so (p.38). Since the electricity market hedging model
used for the market-based approach is calibrated to the NEM, it
does take into account generation by renewable energy sources
and therefore incorporates the impact of the merit order effect of
renewable generation (e.g. Frontier Economics, 2011).7

Fig. 4 illustrates the impact different pass-through rates of the
merit order effect had on indicative net effects for residential or
small business consumers in 2011–12 and 2012-13. These con-
sumers are expected to face full RET costs, illustrated by the top
bars. However, net costs can be reduced signiﬁcantly, when the
reduction of wholesale prices, caused by increased wind genera-
is passed through to consumers. Therefore, methods of
tion,
calculating the wholesale component in regulated retail prices
that are likely to capture merit order effects are expected to reduce

7 Although both the perturbation LRMC approach and market-based methods
using future prices are considered to be efﬁcient estimates of future wholesale
electricity costs, estimates might diverge on a year-by-year basis (AEMC, 2013a).
This may have several reasons, including assumptions made in the models, NEM
market design that encourages particular behaviour by incumbents and new
entrants, the fact that the RET is driving generation investment in the absence of
an energy market signal and ﬁnally, falling demand.

the overall cost of the LRET for these small consumers. If the
wholesale component in the regulated tariffs is not reﬂective of
the actual costs of purchasing electricity on the wholesale market
by the retailer, this constitutes an additional proﬁt for retailers,
ﬁnanced by regulated electricity consumers.

Generally,

jurisdictions have moved away from standalone
LRMC towards market-based approaches during the past two
years (Table 10), which may be attributed to the attempt to “place
downward pressure on regulated retail prices” (IPART, 2013 p. 11)
given that “[standalone] LRMC ignores prevailing conditions in the
electricity market, which can be inﬂuenced by a range of factors
and which can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on energy purchase
costs” (QCA, 2012 p. 22). Regulators use both forecast prices and
publicly available future or forward prices in their market-based
energy purchase cost estimates, depending on how liquid they
judge the futures market. The AEMC (2013a) suggests that using
prices observed on the futures market is likely to lead to more
efﬁcient and transparent results and regulators acknowledge that
“the main beneﬁt of using market forward prices over modelled
forward prices is that it is more transparent” (IPART, 2013, p. 60).

4.2. Pass-through of RET costs

The pass-through of RET certiﬁcate costs is likely to mainly
depend on the level of exemption of the individual consumer.
Fig. 5 shows estimated indicative effects for industry that received
90% exemption from RET costs in 2011–12 and 2012–13.

If some of the merit order effect is passed through to these
electricity consumers, they are likely overcompensated for their
contribution to the costs of the RET.
If this contribution was
increased, this would lower the cost for remaining (non-exempt)
consumers. Note that the estimated average LRET costs employed in
this analysis are a weighted-average of the LRET allowance in
regulated tariffs and may therefore be higher than the costs
companies with tailored contracts (or that buy LGCs directly on the
market) actually face. On the other hand, there may be issues with
retailers exerting market power towards exempt consumers and not
compensating them for the whole value of the PEC (AIGN 2012).

For electricity consumers receiving a regulated retail tariff, the
regulator has to estimate a green scheme allowance. In order to do
so, a price forecast for LGCs needs to be made. Again, regulators

have adopted differing methods when estimating the green scheme
allowance in their retail tariffs. New South Wales uses an LRMC
approach (IPART, 2011), while Queensland and the ACT use market-
based approaches (QCA, 2011; ICRC, 2011). To date, estimated LGC
prices have been close to observed market prices (Table 11).8

In their recent review of regulated electricity prices, IPART has
considerably increased the forecast for prices of LGCs. This increase
is mainly due to the application of a higher weighted average cost of
capital (WACC) in the LRMC framework for LGC costs. Table 12
shows estimated LGC costs in the 2011 review and the 2013 review.
Estimated prices are higher than observed spot market prices for
LGCs, which could mean that more than 100% of RET costs are
passed through to regulated electricity consumers.

8 ROAM Consulting (2012) comment on the fact that modelled LGC prices are
generally higher than observed spot market prices. They assume that most LGCs are
contracted through power purchase agreements (80%), while the spot market is
only used for short term liabilities (20%).

5. Conclusions and policy implications

Since its inception in 2001, the Australian Renewable Energy
Target (RET) has spurred considerable investment in renewable
electricity generation. Using time-series regression, we highlight
that the increasing amount of wind energy fed into the NEM has
placed a considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity
prices through the so-called merit order effect.

On the other hand, costs of the RET are passed on to consumers
in the form of higher retail electricity prices through ‘green’
surcharges imposed by retailers who are liable parties under the
scheme. The net impact on a particular energy user depends on a
number of factors. These include whether or not they are largely
exempt from paying for the cost of the RET, and the extent to
which lower wholesale electricity prices are passed through into
retail electricity prices paid by consumers.

Our ﬁndings suggest that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts and costs of the
RET for energy consumers could potentially be more equitably
distributed. While it is impossible to estimate net effects for
individual consumers with certainty, our analysis points to two
key policy implications (i) the potentially large ﬁnancial transfers
between energy users arising from the current level (and extent) of
RET exemptions for some favoured large energy-intensive indus-
tries and (ii) the question to what extent the, perhaps only short
term, beneﬁts of the RET in putting downward pressure on whole-
sale prices are passed through to different energy consumer classes.
Contrasting the estimated reduction in wholesale prices with
the costs of the RET to exempt industries, suggests that some
companies might be currently signiﬁcantly overcompensated for
their contribution to the costs of the RET by the merit order effect
of wind, particularly those exempt from 90% of RET costs. There is
scope for re-examining these assistance rates in light of reduced
wholesale prices due to merit order effects, as a broader liability
base could reduce the cost of the RET for remaining electricity
consumers, and, in particular, households.

Furthermore, when evaluating the impact of the RET on
electricity prices, both its costs, but also its beneﬁts should be
taken into account. At the moment the focus is on RET costs added
to the retail price of electricity. However, the distributional effects
of the RET are likely being worsened at present by regulators not

50

adequately passing on lower spot prices through to residential
households and small businesses on default regulated tariffs due
to their various methodologies for estimating wholesale energy
purchase costs. If retailers passed through more of the reduction in
wholesale prices,
induced at least in part through additional
renewable generation, the overall impact of the RET on retail
electricity prices could be considerably smaller.

There might be a case for removing the regulation of retail
prices in some jurisdictions. However, all consumers including
households and small business already have the right to opt-out of
a regulated tariff and take up a market offer. Some States have
removed default regulated tariffs entirely. However, there are
concerns regarding the level of effective competition being
achieved within competitive retail market arrangements given
the current dominant positions of three major vertically integrated
‘gentailers’ in the NEM. It remains to be seen whether an oligopoly
of retailers would show greater appetite for passing reduced
wholesale prices on to consumers. Therefore, the ﬁrst step could
be for governments to give some guidance on how regulators
could better incorporate reduced wholesale prices due to merit
order effects in retail tariffs, as in the AEMC report on best practice
retail price methodology (AEMC, 2013a).

Finally, the distributional impacts of energy and climate policy are
commonly not a primary focus of policy makers given effectiveness
and efﬁciency objectives. They often only come into view after the
policies have been operating for some period of time. Our analysis
highlights the potential value of considering distributional issues ex-
ante when designing and implementing energy and climate policy,
especially the level and scope of any exemptions offered as ‘so-called’
compensation to particular parties. While there are both environ-
mental and economic reasons for exempting some industries from
complying with the full costs of such policies, regulators have to keep
in mind that any of those exemptions will generally increase the costs
for the non-exempt parties. As such, the estimated distributional
effects are not an inherent feature of the RET or any renewable energy
support policy, but the result of design choices made when imple-
menting the policy.

There exist other dimensions of distributional issues in relation to
renewable energy policies, such as between households of different
income groups (cf. Neuhoff et al., 2013) or between producers and
consumers of electricity (cf. Hirth and Ueckerdt, 2013), which have not
been addressed here. Note, that our study examines short run effects
of renewable energy generation on the wholesale price for electricity.
Whether reduced wholesale prices due to renewable generation are a
long term phenomenon depends on their impact on investment and
divestment decisions in the industry and the future design of
electricity markets. As always, further work is required to better
understand these important issues.

What’s next for the Renewable Energy Target –
resolving Australia’s integration of energy and
climate change policy?*

Tim Nelson , Tahlia Nolan and Joel Gilmore†

Australian climate change policy and its integration with Australia’s electricity
markets have been fraught for at least two decades. The only enduring policy has been
the Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target (RET). Despite the relative success of
the RET in driving investment and reducing emissions, state governments have now
pivoted towards contracts-for-diﬀerence (Cfds). In this article, we outline the issues
associated with policy discontinuity and the large-scale RET and review its
eﬀectiveness as an emissions reduction tool and driver of electricity sector abatement.
We ﬁnd that the RET has been relatively successful across the key criteria of cost and
emissions reductions and is a better policy instrument than contracts-for-diﬀerence,
which are increasingly being adopted by state governments. Building on the work of
Nelson et al. (2020), we propose a new approach, which would allow for continued use
of Cfds but utilising the RET’s policy architecture.

Key words: electricity market, production subsidy, variable renewable energy.

1. Introduction

Australia has had a haphazard approach to integration of climate change and
energy policy for decades. This is despite Australia having committed to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a manner consistent with a carbon
budget that would limit anthropogenic climate change to no more than two
degree Celsius. The implied carbon budget for Australia to meet this
commitment is a 50% reduction on 2005 emission levels by 2030 (Mein-
shausen et al., 2021) and achieving a 1.5 degrees outcome (which is an
aspirational goal of all governments through the United Nations Convention
on Climate Change: UNFCCC) would require a 75% reduction. It is worth
noting that this is signiﬁcantly greater than the current Commonwealth
Government target of 26–28% by 2030. It can therefore be inferred that
greater emission reduction targets in the future are likely, with international

pressure likely to ‘ratchet up’ commitments by the Australian Government,
for the emissions reduction target through to 2030 and/or for emissions
reduction targets for the post-2030 period.

At the national level, only two policies have materially reduced emissions
within the electricity sector: the Clean Energy Future (carbon pricing)
package, which was introduced on 1 July 2012 but then repealed on 1 July
2014; and the Renewable Energy Target. At the state level, several policies
were utilised prior to the Clean Energy Future package superseding them.
These included the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme (GGAS) and
the Queensland 13% (and subsequently 18%) Gas Scheme. Importantly,
governments have tried and failed to agree on a national approach to an
emissions
intensity scheme through the National Energy Guarantee
(Simshauser & Tiernan, 2019).

The Renewable Energy Target is a renewable certiﬁcate obligation (ROC)
or renewable portfolio standard (RPS) style policy. Energy retailers must buy
a set percentage (currently 20%) of their energy from renewable generators.1
This is achieved by new renewable projects selling certiﬁcates (called large-
scale generation certiﬁcates, or LGCs) for each unit of production to retailers.
This results in new investment in wind, solar and other green technologies.
Policies utilising a ROC-style framework have been well studied in markets in
Europe and Australia (see Foxson & Pearson, 2007; Nelson, 2015; Wood &
Dow, 2010, 2011; Woodman & Mitchell, 2011). Sioshansi (2021, p.3) notes
that, ‘renewable portfolio standards have long been favoured in the United
States – as opposed to Feed-in-tariﬀs or other instruments popular in
Europe’.

Despite the enduring success of the RET as Australia’s only long-term
emissions reduction policy for the electricity sector, the lack of a compre-
hensive national policy approach to reducing emissions has seen state
governments continue to implement suboptimal contract-for-diﬀerence (Cfd)
style policies (Nelson & Gilmore, 2021). A Cfd is eﬀectively an agreement for
the government to make up the diﬀerence between the market price for
electricity and the price agreed to between the renewable generator and the
government. The Victorian Government has utilised Cfd structures to
support new VRE investment through its VRET policy which is aimed at
achieving 50% renewable energy by 2030. This has been legislated in the
Renewable Energy (Jobs and Investment) Act 2017 (Vic). The ACT has
similarly utilised Cfd structures to achieve its goal of 100% of the territory’s
energy being sourced from renewables. Table 1 provides a breakdown of
investment in renewables by scheme driver.

As shown in Table 1, Cfds have comparatively driven only a small
percentage of renewable energy investment with the vast majority of

Australian renewable energy projects banked under the RET (Simshauser &
Gilmore, 2020). However, the NSW Government has now legislated one of
the world’s most ambitious policies through the NSW Energy Roadmap.
Under the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020, the NSW Govern-
ment has committed to using ‘swaptions’ or long-term energy service
agreements (LTSEAs) to underpin 12 GW of new renewable generation
across three new Renewable Energy Zones (REZs).2
‘Swaptions’ are
contracts where the seller has an option to take up a Cfd at some point in
the future. The plan also involves the use of an underwriting mechanism to
deliver ~2 GW of new ﬁrming capacity such as battery storage or pumped
hydro. It is therefore a critical policy juncture point to assess whether the
RET in a moderated form or Cfds are a superior policy choice to drive
renewable investment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The NSW Government is responding to market forecasts that over the next
20 years Australia’s ageing baseload coal ﬂeet will be progressively replaced
by 30–45 GW of additional utility scale renewable energy capacity (AEMO
ISP, 2020, p. 12). It is anticipated that this renewable growth will be
facilitated by the parallel development of 15–20 GW of ﬂexible, dispatchable,
fast-start ﬁrming capacity. Given the high expected levels of variable
renewable energy (VRE) penetration, around half of this ﬁrming capacity is
likely to be ‘medium’ and ‘deep’ energy storage (+4hrs). Technologies likely
to be deployed include pumped storage hydro, long-duration battery storage
and potentially hydrogen fuel cells or turbines.

Given the shortcomings of Cfd style policies being adopted by state
it is unclear why
governments are well known (see Simshauser, 2019),
policymakers have pivoted away from ROC/RPS policies towards Cfds.3 The
purpose of this paper is to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the RET in this
context and consider how it could be utilised in the future as part of
Australia’s policy architecture to reduce emissions cost eﬀectively within the

2 In contrast, peak demand in the entire NSW region is only ~14 GW.

certiﬁcated schemes, although this has never been tested by Australian courts.

electricity sector. Section 2 provides a brief literature review of analysis of
Australian and international renewable energy stimulus and greenhouse
abatement policies. Section 3 presents simple quantitative analysis of the
RET across the twin objectives of eﬃcient design and emissions reduction.
RET policy design adjustments, based upon quantitative analysis of marginal
and average abatement, are presented in Section 4 with concluding remarks
following in Section 5.

2. Literature review

The existing literature is heavily skewed towards analysing the use of a broad-
based carbon price to reﬂect the externality cost of producing greenhouse gas
emissions. It is almost universally agreed that a well-designed carbon pricing
mechanism would be a superior policy choice for reducing emissions
(Freebairn, 2020). Studies examining national and international greenhouse
gas emissions pricing include the following: Freebairn (2012, 2014a, 2014b,
2018); Garnaut (2011, 2014, 2015); Holden and Dixon (2018); Quiggin et al.
(2014); Wood and Blowers (2016); Naughten (2013); The Climate Institute
(2013); Kember et al. (2013); and Clarke (2011). Many of these studies are
quantitative in nature and conclusions have been built upon through the use
of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling. These include Adams
(2007), Adams and Parmenter (2013), Adams et al. (2014) and Meng et al.
(2013). In particular, McKibbin, Wilcoxen and their colleagues have
published multiple studies since the 1990s (see, e.g., McKibbin et al., 2009,
2012, 2014; McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 2002a, 2002b; Pearce & McKibbin,
2007).4

However, although the theoretical and applied literature demonstrating a
well-designed emissions trading scheme should be adopted, most of the
political debate is ﬁxed on the future of coal and gas within the real economy
in Australia. Sadly, this completely misrepresents the real risks to the
Australian economy (Nelson, 2015). Australia is one of the world’s largest
energy exporters. Coal (14.8%) and gas (10.6%) comprise around one-
quarter of Australian exports. Australia is the largest exporter of coal with
around 30% of all total coal exports and has recently overtaken Qatar as the
world’s largest exporter of LNG. In this context,
it matters little what
Australian politicians think the future of gas and coal looks like. What
matters are the views of Australia’s largest energy trading importers such as
Japan, Taiwan, China and Korea. All of these countries have committed to
net zero and are shifting consumption away from Australia’s fossil fuel
exports. The sad outworking of this situation is that, ‘According to the 2020

4 Both McKibbin (in general) and Nelson (2015) make the point that mitigation impacts on
Australia are likely to be mostly incurred through other countries shifting their energy mix
away from coal and gas, two large sources of export revenue.

Climate Change Performance Index, Australia was ranked as the worst-
performing country on climate change policy (Ali et al., 2020)’.

2.1 The cost of uncertainty and the ‘merit-order eﬀect’

Given the fraught political debate about the future of coal and gas in the
Australian economy, there has been ongoing policy discontinuity in relation
to energy and climate change (see Simshauser & Tiernan, 2019). The costs of
this ongoing policy uncertainty have been well documented in the Australian
literature (see Byrnes et al., 2013; Jones, 2010, 2014; Nelson, 2015; Nelson
et al., 2010, 2012). Many of these studies note that in a capital-intensive
industry such as electricity, a lack of certainty in relation to public policy
results in suboptimal capital investment (including the potential for stranded
asset risk in higher capacity factor gas plant). Over time, this manifests in
higher than necessary electricity costs driven by a higher weighted average
cost of capital (WACC) and an industry preference to minimise capital at risk
by deploying higher operating cost technologies (see Nelson et al, 2010;
Nelson et al, 2013).

Simshauser and Gilmore (2020) provide a very useful overview of the ‘rate
of change’ problem whereby signiﬁcant additional costs have been imposed
on the Australian economy due to Australia’s policy incoherence. Ongoing
policy changes resulted in an ‘investment megacycle’ whereby ~12,000MW of
plant commitments comprising $20+ billion across 105 projects was squeezed
into just three years (2017–2020).5 Unsurprisingly, there were signiﬁcant
connection delays and major issues with system frequency operating outside
normal bands, critical reductions in system strength and increasing interven-
tions by the market operator to keep the system secure. Instead of focusing
on these important engineering issues, the policy debate shifted towards
market redesign proposals with a focus on future reliability and resource
adequacy. Sadly, very little of the debate was grounded in an understanding
of the problem (see Nelson et al., 2018).

2.2 Renewable energy certiﬁcate schemes

The main limitation of mechanisms such as the RET is that they are not
technology neutral. While they are a better policy design than general
subsidies, they overlook opportunities for abatement (e.g. energy eﬃciency)
because of their focus on new investment in production capacity (Freebairn,
2018). While mechanisms that subsidise new investment can lower wholesale
electricity prices in the short run (assuming the absence of existing generator
retirements) (Bell et al., 2017), the policy can have the perverse eﬀect of
stimulating electricity consumption beyond eﬃcient levels (Freebairn, 2018).
Critically, the ‘merit-order eﬀect’ of lower prices is temporary. Wholesale

5 For contrast, the NEM’s entire capacity is ~50 GW.

prices will rise to the long-run average cost (LRAC) of the eﬃcient new
generation mix (see Nelson et al., 2018)6. Importantly, quantitative modelling
has demonstrated that LRET style mechanisms have higher abatement costs
than well-designed emissions tax and trading mechanisms (Buckman &
Diesendorf, 2010). In short, most of the literature around LRET style policies
ﬁnds that they are inferior to a well-designed emissions trading scheme (see
Nelson et al., 2019).

There are also signiﬁcant beneﬁts associated with ROC-style policies such
as the LRET. In the Australian context, the LRET has resulted in signiﬁcant
additional investment, particularly in new wind generation (Cludius et al.,
2014). Bell et al. (2017) found that the LRET has lowered wholesale spot
prices through reductions in technology costs. Rather than the overarching
policy mechanism, design ﬂaws of LRET in its implementation in a market
with signiﬁcant retail and generator concentration may have contributed to
suboptimal outcomes (see, e.g., Buckman & Diesendorf, 2010; Simshauser &
Tiernan, 2019). Furthermore, the ongoing review and amendment of the
LRET and continuing disagreement between the Commonwealth and state
impact on its cost-
governments is likely to have had a detrimental
eﬀectiveness (see Jones, 2010, 2014).

2.3 Contracts-for-diﬀerence schemes
Government-initiated Cfds are relatively simple in structure.7 Governments
hold reverse auctions for capacity and award Cfds to the winning proponents
of new generation. The Cfd structure generally involves a ‘strike price’, which
is compared to the wholesale spot price in each settlement period. Where the
wholesale price is lower than the strike price, the government pays the
proponent the diﬀerence. If the wholesale price is higher than the strike price,
the generator pays the government the diﬀerence.

While it is true that CfDs may reduce risks to individual project proponents
from a LRET ﬂoating LGC price (Woodman & Mitchell, 2011), Bunn and
Yusupov (2015) demonstrate that with negative correlation between renew-
able output and wholesale electricity prices, LGCs reduce counterparty
investment risk when compared to Cfds or feed-in tariﬀs (FiTs).

There are obvious problems with utilising Cfds. Governments eﬀectively
‘become the market’ and determine which generator investments proceed.
While governments have learned important lessons from previous failures to
deal with marginal loss factor (MLF) risk and prolonged oversupply and
negative pricing, their continued use will eﬀectively result in governments
(rather than markets) absorbing all of the risk of poor investment decisions.

6 A reviewer of this manuscript helpfully noted that this LRAC may in fact be lower than
that of the previous eﬃcient mix due to the introduction of new lower cost of technologies.
7 A reviewer of an early draft of this manuscript helpfully noted that the discussion around

Cfds in this Section is speciﬁc to government-initiated Cfds, not Cfds in general.

T. Nelson et al.

Electricity markets are incredibly dynamic and investments need to consider
not just the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) but the spatial and temporal
dynamics of market pricing. Building very low-cost generators with very high
renewable resources in congested and weak parts of the grid has resulted in
very poor outcomes in Victoria’s north-west (see Simshauser & Gilmore,
2020). Furthermore, it is na¨ıve to assume governments are well placed to
decide which investments are likely to be economic due to the need to assess a
project’s production against a dynamic market with signiﬁcant changes in
demand across the day and season. In fact, one of the strengths of utilising a
market approach rather than a Cfd is that poor investments result in the
project proponent (rather than the government) writing down their invest-
ment with consumers beneﬁting.

Simshauser (2019) notes that there are three inherent limitations associated

with Cfds:

(cid:129) Government-initiated CfDs are usually awarded on simpliﬁed metrics such
as minimising the LCOE. As noted above, ignoring temporal and spatial
dynamics is likely to introduce ineﬃcient plant entry. In contrast, well-
designed renewable portfolio standards such as the LRET require investors
in generation to determine not just costs but the spatial and temporal
dynamics of the project relative to the market.

(cid:129) Importantly, Cfds introduce a new category of ‘quasi-market’ participant
that is completely removed from the market’s locational, spot and forward
pricing signals. Over time, this results in suboptimal decision making within
the dispatch of energy and increases the risks to secure and reliable system
operation.

(cid:129) The use of Cfds results in these new ‘quasi-market’ participants withdraw-
ing from primary issuance forward derivative hedge markets. Given the
certainty of revenue due to the Cfd, there is little incentive for these new
generators to manage price risk using ﬁnancial derivative contracts. Over
time, the government eﬀectively becomes the market. Eﬃcient pricing,
retail competition and innovation are likely to be stiﬂed as new participants
are unable to compete.

One of the overlooked aspects of Cfds in the Australian context is the
impact of shifting policy support to an alternative mechanism despite the
signiﬁcant investment made to date under a long-term enduring policy. The
RET has delivered over 16 GW of new investment, which is underpinned by
the market value of wholesale electricity prices and LGCs. By shifting
towards Cfds, governments are eﬀectively stranding investments and eﬀec-
tively transferring existing renewable proponent producer surplus to con-
sumer surplus and new entrants with the potential for issues related to
reﬁnancing and ‘toxic debt’ (see Nelson et al., 2013; Simshauser & Nelson,
2012). Our analysis and policy recommendations in subsequent sections
consider ways in which Cfds could be modiﬁed to minimise these impacts.

Advocates of Cfds generally use two arguments that are ﬂawed in our
opinion: reductions in the weighted average cost of capital; and the ‘merit-
order eﬀect’. Given the signiﬁcant exposure of existing debt and equity
participants to the 16 GW of projects already built under the RET (with
much of it being reﬁnanced in 2022 and 2023), project proponents will likely
face higher WACCs as a result of the erosion in value of their projects due to
the switch from one form of policy support (RET) to another (Cfds) – see
Simshauser and Gilmore (2020) for further analysis on this topic.

The ‘merit-order eﬀect’ has been promoted as a reason for introducing
both ROC and Cfd style policies. The phenomenon is well documented in the
academic literature, with studies originating from around 2008. The earliest
studies focused on economic impacts of introducing very low short-run
marginal cost technologies such as variable renewables (Gelabert et al., 2011;
Pirnia et al., 2011; P ¨oyry for the European Wind Energy Association, 2009;
Sensfuss et al., 2008). Australian studies have also examined the phe-
nomenon. Many studies have considered the impacts on the NEM price
duration curve (see Bell et al., 2017; Cludius et al., 2014; Forrest & MacGill,
2013; MacGill, 2010) and the impact of coincident production on speciﬁc
price bands.

However, as Nelson et al. (2012) and Simshauser (2019) note, the merit-
order eﬀect is a transitory phenomenon. Prices must return to levels that
allow for ﬁxed and operating costs to be recovered or plant is permanently
withdrawn, resulting in signiﬁcant intra- and interperiod pricing volatility
(see Nelson et al., 2018). This is an important observation given one of the
purported beneﬁts of the NSW Energy Roadmap is permanently lower
wholesale electricity prices.8

2.4 Emerging literature on policy evolution

A deﬁning feature of good public policy is the creation of a uniform value of
abatement. This allows for the lowest cost abatement to be pursued ﬁrst
(Freebairn, 2020). It is therefore worth considering whether the RET can be
‘evolved’ to better align with this principle by creating fungibility with other
forms of abatement in Australia such as Australian Carbon Credit Units
(ACCUs). This is something that was explored by Nelson et al. (2021) who
proposed tying economic value from ROC, Cfd or PFiT policies to either
emissions intensity or wholesale electricity prices.

Our analysis in the proceeding sections considers this issue. In particular,
we ﬁnd that the worst impacts of Cfd can be overcome if they are written
against the LGC (rather than the wholesale price). This ensures that market

8 It is important to note the two distinct pricing outcomes. One is the result of shifting to a
lower cost mix of new technologies. The other is driven by government-induced oversupply
with a transfer of existing producer surplus (including existing clean energy generation) to
consumer surplus.

participants continue to face the spatial and temporal dynamics associated
with locating and operating in the NEM. This can also allow for integration
of Cfd policies within a broader carbon framework due to the assignment of
carbon abatement to LGCs through an emissions ‘exchange rate’.

3. Assessment of the RET against multifaceted criteria

In this section, we evaluate the RET against qualitative and quantitative
criteria: emissions abatement; and price and cost-eﬀectiveness. The purpose
of our analysis is to determine whether the RET has been successful as a
means of providing a sustainable framework for cost-eﬀective emissions
reductions within the electricity sector.

3.1 Emissions abatement

Australia currently produces around 500 million tonnes (mt) of greenhouse
emissions (carbon dioxide equivalent: CO2e) each year. The sectoral
breakdown of emissions is shown in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1 shows that the stationary energy sector (including electricity)
produces around half of all greenhouse emissions. Electricity is the largest
single point source of emissions with around one-third of total Australian
emissions. However, it is also a relatively low-cost source of abatement with
the potential for further technology evolution and deployment into other
transport and stationary energy
sectors

through electriﬁcation (e.g.

processes). Given these dynamics, it is not surprising that the electricity sector
has been the focus of policy makers through the RET and now emerging Cfd
policies in the ACT, Victoria and NSW.

Figure 2 shows the impact of electricity sector policies on generation
output in the NEM over the past decade. As uncertainty around the
investment trajectory required by the RET was removed following the
Warburton Review in 2014 (see Nelson, 2015), an investment megacycle
occurred between 2017 and 2020 (recall Table 1). The share of variable
renewables (VRE) climbed rapidly to around 20% in 2020. Almost all this
investment utilised LGCs as part of project economics and ﬁnancing.

Figure 3 shows the strong correlation between the penetration of VRE and
electricity sector emissions in recent years. As new renewables have entered
the system, existing and ageing coal assets have been retired. In fact, around
one-third of Australia’s coal-ﬁred power stations closed in the 2010s as a
consequence of renewables entering the system (Burke et al., 2018). The
substitution of these relatively high emitting assets with renewables has
reduced NEM emissions by around 15%. Importantly, the contribution of
electricity sectoral emission reductions to the overall Australian inventory has
been signiﬁcant. This is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 demonstrates that the RET is likely to have done much of the
heavy lifting in relation to Australian emissions reductions. Quarterly total
emissions have decreased from ~145mt in 2010 to around ~125mt in 2020. Of
this ~20mt reduction in quarterly emissions,
the electricity sector has

delivered around 60% or ~12mt per quarter. This is a nontrivial ﬁnding. Of
all the policies introduced to reduce emissions (QLD 18% Gas Scheme, NSW
GGAS, Clean Energy Future, Emission Reduction Fund and Safeguard
Mechanism), a single policy is arguably delivering the majority of the
emissions reductions that are being sustainably achieved (as noted in Figure 3
and supported by Nelson et al., 2018 and Simshauser, 2019).9 As a policy
instrument, the RET has been very successful in reducing emissions. It is
continuing to provide the underlying policy architecture for additional
reductions through voluntary purchases by corporate customers and house-
holds (via GreenPower).10

3.2 Pricing and economic eﬀectiveness

Electricity pricing has been a politically charged topic in Australia following
the closure of the Hazelwood power station and a rapid run up in wholesale
electricity prices in 2017 and 2018. Since 2011, the general Consumer Price
Index (CPI) rose by around 2% pa, while the electricity component of the
CPI rose by around 3.5% pa. Much of this is explained by ineﬃcient increases
in network spending and a rise in new entrant costs for wholesale markets.
Simshauser and Gilmore (2020) note that the NEM’s history of new entrant
cost is comprised of three separate and distinct time periods. Up until 2011,
the NEM was characterised by new entrant costs of between $40/MWh and
$60/MWh with the dominant technology shifting from coal to gas in the mid-
2000s. Between 2011and 2015, the NEM new entrant cost increased further to
between $60-80/MWh for a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) as higher gas
prices manifested because of east-coast gas demand tripling due to the
emergence of LNG exports. Since 2015, the new entrant cost has approx-
imated $70–80/MWh as ﬁrmed wind has emerged as the technology of
choice.11,12

It should be noted that the upward trend in new entrant cost is not simply a
function of the RET. Input fuel costs for thermal plant have increased
signiﬁcantly over the past decade as both coal and gas markets became
increasingly export exposed. In the case of coal, $AUD pricing increased

9 While the RET has signiﬁcantly reduced emissions,

it is unclear how much higher
emissions would have been without energy eﬃciency measures that have reduced energy
consumption.

10 As at June 2021, there are around 3 GW of new large-scale renewable projects at various

stages of commissioning and construction.

11 Firmed wind is eﬀectively the cost of a MWh of wind added to the cost of a $300 cap
contract (which reﬂects the ﬁxed cost of a gas-turbine). In this way, the MWh of wind becomes
‘ﬁrmed’ by the gas turbine and is equivalent to an MWh from a high-capacity factor thermal
plant.

12 Some market participants have announced Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) well
below these new entrant costs. This is due to the emergence of ‘two-step pricing’ whereby
participants allocate low returns to equity in the short to medium term with a view that
signiﬁcant returns will emerge in the future due to higher pricing. This business model is
unlikely to be sustainable.

from ~$50/tonne in 2005 to ~$100–150/tonne over the past decade. Assuming
a heat rate of 9 to 10GJ/MWh, the implied short-run marginal fuel cost has
increased from $25/MWh up to as high as $65/MWh. Similarly, gas prices
increased materially from a historical cost-plus model of around $3–4/GJ to
LNG export netback prices of up to $15/GJ. Given this signiﬁcant variability
in fuel cost, it is unsurprising that the benchmark new entrant cost has
become ﬁrmed renewables.

Figure 5 shows that the Australian NEM and RET are classic commodity
markets. There is both intra- and interperiod volatility within the NEM,
representing lumpy capital investment and withdrawal and short-term spatial
and temporal constraints (see Nelson et al., 2018). When annual averages are
considered, prices reﬂect market imbalances and are generally mean reverting
(like any commodity market).

However, policy discontinuity also played a signiﬁcant role in the market
dynamics observed in Figure 5. Between 2013 and 2015, the Commonwealth
Government repealed Australia’s national carbon pricing framework and
commissioned a debilitating review of
the RET. During this period,
renewable investment stalled as market participants faced lower prices due
to oversupply,
lower LGC prices due to concerns the Government was
predisposed to repealing the RET legislation and waited for the outcomes of
the Government’s deliberations. With a revised trajectory settled in 2014/15,
LGC prices rapidly recovered and existing coal-ﬁred power stations contin-
ued to withdraw from the market driving wholesale electricity prices higher.

149

To assess the RET’s eﬀectiveness in sustainably driving new investment
(despite the uncertainty discussed above), we have reconstructed the
economics of a ‘typical’ wind project in South Australia developed in each
year between 2011 and 2020. South Australia has been selected given the
signiﬁcant deployment of renewables over the past decade (largely due to the
region’s superior wind speeds). Capital costs, ﬁxed and operating costs, and
ﬁnancing costs have been sourced from Simshauser and Gilmore (2020). The
levelised cost of energy (LCOE) in each year is determined using the following
formula.

LCOE ¼ Capex (cid:2) CRF þ FOM

ð8760∗CFÞ

þ VOM

(1)

Where capex = overnight capital cost ($/kW). FOM = ﬁxed operating and
maintenance costs ($/kW), CF = capacity factor (%),VOM = variable oper-
ating and maintenance costs ($/KWh), CRF = capital recovery factor (the
earning back of initial investment in capex plus a return represented by
WACC).

The capital recovery factor is determined using the following formula:

CRF ¼

(cid:3)
(cid:1)
WACCð1 þ WACCÞt
(cid:3)
(cid:1)
½ð1 þ WACCÞt(cid:3) (cid:4) 1

(2)

where t is the number of time periods
WACC is the weighted average cost of capital, which is determined using the
following formula:

WACC ¼ rd∗Debt share þ ðre∗ð1 (cid:4) debt shareÞÞ

(3)

where rd and re represent the returns to debt and equity respectively and the
debt share is the proportion of total funding that is debt (as opposed to
equity).
Key input assumptions for deriving the LCOE in each year between 2011 and
2020 are presented in Table 2. The proportion of funding from debt and
equity has been set at 50% in each year.

Having derived an LCOE for each year from 2011 and 2012 for a ‘typical’
wind project in the Australian market, we are then able to determine whether
the LCOE is recovered from electricity and LGC revenue. The total revenue
in each year is the aggregate wind proﬁle dispatch weighted average (DWA)
price for the year added to the average annual LGC price per MWh
generated. The net revenue in each year is therefore:

Net Revenuet ¼ DWAt þ LGCt (cid:4) LCOEconstruction year

(4)

Two sets of results are presented in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. Table 3
shows the net annual revenue for 1 MWh of ‘typical’ South Australian wind
farms built in each year from 2011 to 2020. Table 4 provides the same
analysis but with only the electricity revenue (and not the LGC revenue)
included in the calculations.

Our results demonstrate the variability in cash ﬂows and proﬁtability for
merchant assets in an energy-only gross pool market. Wind farms built
between 2011 and 2015 experienced losses during these years but signiﬁcant
the tight supply/demand balance that prevailed
proﬁtability because of
between 2016 and 2018. As the market cycle swung back into oversupply in
2019 and 2020, all the projects built across all years (including 2020) once again
experienced negative proﬁtability. In total, 21 of the 55 annual proﬁtability
results provided in Table 3 are negative. This is an important feature of the
RET’s policy design. Consumers beneﬁt from market participants overbuilding
(and facilitating oversupply) through lower prices.13

However, if the LGC revenue is removed (as shown in Table 4), then the
total number of years in which a negative economic outcome is recorded
increases to 46 (out of the total 55 years). This has nontrivial implications for
policy design which we will explore in further detail in the subsequent section.
Put simply, utilisation of policy frameworks that only utilise the wholesale
electricity price are likely to create a signiﬁcant exposure for governments
(and taxpayers) or energy consumers due to prolonged policy-induced
periods of oversupply driving the out-of-market subsidy higher. If this is not

13 It is important to note that LGC’s may have been under long-term contract, and
therefore, market prices may not be as relevant. However, it is important to note that
consumers continued to pay LGC ‘market prices’ as these are referenced in customer contracts.
As such, a key consideration for policy makers in the design of ROC style policies is whether
market power could be used by a small number of liable entities to extract rents from
consumers.

the case, then Cfd style frameworks are likely to accentuate the boom/bust
nature of wholesale electricity prices resulting in poorer outcomes for
consumers.14 At the very least, the RET has not removed the incentive for
participants to manage the temporal and spatial risks associated with
operating in the wholesale electricity market. A renewable resource with a
poor correlation to demand and price is penalised relative to a project that
optimises location and resource to deliver energy where and when customers
require it.

4. Policy recommendations: integrating Cfd frameworks using the RET

The RET required investment in renewable energy generation equivalent to
the annual production of 33 TWh by 2020. At the time of writing, this
objective has been achieved. Discussion about the future of the RET has
largely been muted given the focus by state governments on developing Cfd
policies to deliver climate change objectives. There are two observations from
our analysis of the RET in the preceding Section which are worth noting in
this context:

(cid:129) Finding 1: the RET facilitated both positive and negative years of cashﬂow
(relative to underlying LCOE). In other words, consumers beneﬁted from
overinvestment through lower prices (relative to LCOE) and all project
proponents were required to address the risks associated with the NEM’s
spatial and temporal dynamics.

(cid:129) Finding 2: Without LGC revenue, all projects would have experienced
negative income (relative to LCOE) almost all of the time. This has
nontrivial implications for policy design. Governments could have been
exposed to signiﬁcant ‘out-of-the-money’ Cfd liabilities of ~$0.25 billion in
South Australia alone.15 In other words, all producers would have been
guaranteed to make a return on their investment: privatising proﬁts and
socialising losses.

The policy propositions that

the quantities of
renewables being added to the NEM through to 2030 are ﬁxed and that
renewables continue to be the cheapest form of zero-emissions electricity (see
Rai and Nelson, 2021). For completeness, we have provided quantitative
modelling of Optimal Plant Mixes in 2030 for the NSW system16 in two

follow assume that

14 This is particularly relevant for large energy-intensive trade exposed industry which
cannot be shielded from higher energy costs in the same way that they are under the RET
(through an LGC surrender exemption).

15 This approximate calculation is based upon total MWh produced by wind in South

Australia in 2020 being exposed to the negative economic outcomes in Table 4.

16 Our modelling is based upon the work of Berrie (1967). This model is outlined in detail in
Nelson et al. (2013) so we do not replicate it here. Importantly, the 12 GW scenario utilises a
residual demand curve based upon assumptions from AEMO’s Integrated System Plan. All
costs utilised are consistent with those in Table 2.

scenarios: build out of the 12 GW of VRE; and no build out of VRE. Our
results (presented in Appendices S1 and S2) show that the price of electricity
is substantially lower in the 12 GW built out case. The focus of our policy
propositions are therefore not related to whether it is appropriate to drive
abatement through VRE adoption, but consideration of superior policy
design to limit unintended consequences associated with Cfds identiﬁed in
Section 2.

4.1 Policy proposition 1 – utilising the RET architecture to implement Cfd
polices

State governments are adopting ambitious policies to decarbonise electricity
grids between 2020 and 2030. This article provides insights into how these
governments could modify their policy frameworks to achieve these goals
while limiting the most negative impacts of Cfds. Section 2 demonstrated that
two limitations in particular require particular attention by policy makers: by
underwriting projects through the wholesale price, governments eﬀectively
remove the need for market participants to eﬃciently locate and operate their
projects to maximise value given spatial and temporal dynamics; and
governments eﬀectively underwrite all the new projects in the market.

Both limitations could be overcome by writing the Cfd or swaption on
LGCs created through the RET policy architecture. By entering into a Cfd
(or swaption) for the government to acquire and voluntarily surrender the
LGCs, market participants would still be required to locate and operate
their project eﬃciently within the wholesale electricity market to maximise
value.17 Market participants would be required to carefully consider
location (to avoid issues related to reductions in dynamic marginal loss
factors: MLFs) and forward hedging of output to minimise exposure to
volatile spot pricing. Consumers would beneﬁt from increased liquidity and
transparency in the short-term and lower sustainable prices in the long-term
as more eﬃcient projects are built and market participants (rather than
governments and/or consumers) face the risk of lower returns due to poor
project performance.

The ‘spread’ of potential price outcomes for LGCs is likely to be lower than
wholesale electricity prices. Assuming current forward market pricing (see
Appendix S3), governments could sell put rights to LGCs for a strike of ~$20/
LGC. As such, the maximum exposure in any year for each MWh would be
$20, although it is unlikely that LGCs would be worth nothing (particularly
given the proceeding discussion in this Article about carbon fungibility). This

17 This could include trading oﬀ total volume (and potentially a higher LCOE) for
additional value, allowing developers to value projects that better match load, are uncorrelated
with other renewable projects, or includes storage that shifts production to higher value
periods.

is a signiﬁcantly better outcome than the average out of the market payment
($56/MWh) that would have been made in 2020 if projects built under the
RET were receiving Cfds.

‘Swaptions’ rather than generic Cfds should be pursued by governments as
a means of incentivising the engagement of voluntary buyers of LGCs. This
would minimise the exposure of governments (and consumers if out-of-
market payments are to be recovered through distribution charges) to
growing ﬁnancial
liabilities. Demand for LGCs by businesses within
Australia continues to grow with many companies committing to ‘science-
based targets’ and aligning their operations and strategy to meet emission
reduction targets implied by the Paris agreement. Companies are increasingly
aware of the need to address climate risk within their operations and the
implications for company directors to discharge their duties under corporate
law.18

The Commonwealth Government

is reforming reporting under the
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act to create greater trans-
parency around how companies in Australia are claiming to be ‘renewable’
or ‘carbon neutral’.19 It is very likely that governments and investors will
require companies to voluntarily surrender LGCs equal to their electricity
use to be able to claim that they are using 100% renewable energy. The
Government is instituting these reforms given the signiﬁcant voluntary
action already being undertaken by corporates in Australia. For example,
22 of the largest companies in Australia have formed a ‘Climate Leaders
Coalition’ and many of Australia’s largest emitters and electricity users are
part of the Climate Active programme established by the Commonwealth
Government.20

By utilising swaptions for LGCs, governments can eﬀectively underwrite
new investment while minimising their own ﬁnancial exposure and
maximising incentives for market participants to locate and operate their
projects eﬃciently and ﬁnd customers for the imbued greenhouse emissions
abatement in their operation. No reforms of the existing RET policy
architecture would be required. The Commonwealth and states could
continue to have diﬀering views on the pace of decarbonisation, but the
framework underpinning new investment in the electricity sector would be
nationally consistent.

4.2 Policy proposition 2 – Carbon fungibility and development of ‘green
hydrogen’

Another key consideration of policymakers in relation to the future of the
RET is its alignment or ‘fungibility’ with other carbon reduction instruments
in Australia. While LGCs surrendered for compliance purposes under the
RET are obviously not ‘additional’, all other LGCs are reducing emissions
beyond legislated targets. Substitution of existing emissions
intensive
generation with new renewables will only occur if: voluntary action is taken
to purchase renewable energy beyond what it is required by the market;
governments mandate new additional VRE investment through Cfds or
‘swaptions’; and/or existing thermal generation is retired at its end-of-life and
new renewables investment occurs to ﬁll the gap created by generator exit.

The ﬁrst two scenarios described above are clearly additional. Additional
abatement is occurring because of voluntary market activity over and above
what would occur through business-as-usual. It is therefore worth consid-
ering how governments create ‘fungibility’ between the greenhouse abatement
facilitated as a result of LGC creation and other sectors where the Australian
Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) represents one tonne of abatement.21

To create ‘fungibility’,

it is ﬁrst necessary to deﬁne an exchange rate
between LGCs (which represent 1 MWh of renewable energy production) and
an ACCU (which represent 1 tonne of greenhouse abatement). This is
achieved through converting LGCs into ACCUs through measuring the
tonnes of abatement per MWh of renewable electricity generated and
consumed. Nelson et al (2021) proposed that exchange rates could be based
upon the average emissions intensity (EI) or the marginal emissions intensity
at a point in time (such as each half hour of settlement within the NEM) or
over a year.

To consider the most appropriate exchange rate, we have calculated the
average emissions intensity by half hour period, the average marginal
intensity of emissions by half hour period, the average and marginal
intensities across the entire year, and the wholesale electricity price by half
hour. We utilised 2019 data and calculated these metrics for New South
Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. We have not considered
transmission ﬂows. For example, NSW does not ‘import’ brown coal
emissions from Victoria. Our calculations for marginal emissions are based
on the emissions intensity of the marginal price setter(s) from AEMO’s
NEMDE dispatch engine. In other words, the emissions intensity of the unit

21 An ACCU is a unit issued to a person by the Clean Energy Regulator (Regulator) by
making an entry for the unit in an account kept by the person in the electronic Australian
National Registry of Emissions Units (Registry). One ACCU represents one tonne of
abatement. The predominant buyer of ACCUs is currently the Commonwealth Government
through the Emissions Reduction Fund, although voluntary demand for ACCUs to oﬀset
emissions is growing.

(s) that would have supplied additional MW in that region but could be
located anywhere in the NEM.

The results of our emissions intensity analysis are presented in Figure 6.
The ﬁrst clear trend is that emissions intensity (particularly marginal
emissions intensity) and price are anticorrelated. During periods of low
prices, coal units are typically setting the price. If renewable generators
produce at times of higher market prices, they are oﬀsetting a generator that,
on average, is almost half as emissions intensive (i.e. a blend of gas and
hydro). Given the diurnal nature of electricity markets, marginal emissions
are low during the evening peak and higher overnight.

Another key observation is that marginal emissions are similar in all
regions (as the NEM is often unconstrained, with similar price setters across
all regions), but average emissions vary signiﬁcantly by state (due to the
diﬀerent composition of generation). In particular, the average is lower in
South Australia, which has the highest penetration of large- and small-scale
variable renewable generation. Importantly, average emissions do not change
signiﬁcantly throughout the day22, but follow similar trends.

We recommend that policy makers set LGC/ACCU exchange rate
fundamentals using the average annual emissions intensity of the entire

22 The relatively constant temporal average emissions are due to the dominance of coal and
renewable generation for energy with gas being relied upon for capacity (and a correspondingly
low capacity factor).

NEM. The only way marginal emissions intensities could be used in a
meaningful way would be through dynamic marginal emissions pricing (i.e.
LGC conversion rates that vary every half hour). In practice, this would be
incredibly diﬃcult and administratively burdensome. Alternatively, average
emission intensity provides an accurate outcome when considered across the
entire market (recall Figure 3). As the NEM will increasingly be intercon-
nected through transmission built out under the Integrated System Plan
(ISP),
it is increasingly certain that generation in any state will reduce
emissions across the NEM.

By utilising LGCs when issuing Cfds or ‘swaptions’, creating fungibility
between LGCs and ACCUs and utilising LGCs as a means of guaranteeing
the origin of ‘green hydrogen’ (see Appendix S4), Australian policymakers
would have eﬀectively facilitated a nationally consistent and integrated
energy and climate policy (without purposely seeking to do so). Market
participants would continue to be able to invest with conﬁdence in new
supply and governments would be less exposed to growing out-of-market
obligations to ﬁnance poor projects. International investors would be able to
purchase quality Australian carbon units with signiﬁcant stimulus to the
Australian economy.

5. Concluding remarks

to force this outcome. Firstly,

Freebairn (2020) provides a useful overview of how to consider a package of
greenhouse abatement policies. While he argues a national emissions price is
the most eﬃcient policy tool, it is unlikely to be the only policy required. Two
institutional barriers,
constraints exist
transaction costs and other nonprice barriers will exist that mute pricing
signals. Energy eﬃciency standards for new appliances are a good example of
this ﬁrst barrier. The second constraint relates to the real political economy
and public resistance to emissions trading and ‘carbon taxes’. In the
Australian context, the second constraint is likely to be more pervasive,
although this may change due to the emergence of border adjustment taxes
that are being developed by major trading partners such as the European
Union.

Climate policy will therefore need to evolve in a way that maximises
economic eﬃciency but is able to be enduring given political realities. In the
Australian context, it is worth considering recent community polling, which
indicates that 55 per cent of all voters agree with reducing emissions to ‘net
zero’ by 2050 with 33 per cent undecided. At the same time, the proportion of
voters that believe the target should be met through increased deployment of
renewable energy is 61 per cent.23 As such, there is considerable merit in

exploring how the RET architecture could be utilised to support growth in
investment in renewables beyond the mandated 33 TWh by 2030.24

This article has reviewed the eﬀectiveness of the RET as a policy tool for
driving investment
in renewable energy and reducing emissions and
contrasted it with emerging state-based Cfd style policies. The RET has
been the primary policy tool for reducing emissions within Australia. In
relation to its impact on electricity markets and consumers, we make two key
ﬁndings:

(cid:129) Finding 1: The RET facilitated both positive and negative years of cashﬂow
(relative to underlying LCOE). In other words, consumers beneﬁted from
overinvestment through lower prices (relative to LCOE) and all project
proponents were required to address the risks associated with the NEM’s
spatial and temporal dynamics.

(cid:129) Finding 2: Without LGC revenue, all renewable projects would have
experienced negative income (relative to LCOE) almost all the time. This
has nontrivial implications for policy design. Governments or consumers
could have been exposed to signiﬁcant ‘out of the money’ Cfd liabilities. In
other words, all producers would have been guaranteed to make a return
on their investment: privatising proﬁts and socialising losses.

Given state governments are pivoting towards Cfd auctions to facilitate
new renewable investment, our policy recommendations relate to integrating
the beneﬁts of the RET and LGC framework within these auction processes.
By writing the Cfd or swaption on the LGC, rather than the wholesale
electricity price, policy makers could overcome the worst aspects of Cfds.
Most importantly, new projects would continue to be exposed to dynamic
spatial and temporal pricing signals and project proponents (rather than
governments or consumers) would wear the risk of underperformance of their
investment.

A further beneﬁt of utilising the existing LGC framework is the integration
of electricity sector abatement within a broader trend of corporates
voluntarily reducing emissions.25 This article has analysed half hourly
marginal, average and annualised marginal and average emissions intensities

24 While economists would contend that a technologically neutral policy would be more
eﬃcient, almost all energy economists, market participants and the peak body in Australia
have publicly stated that renewables are now the cheapest form of energy. See https://thehub.
agl.com.au/-/media/thehub/legacyimported/2018/05/presentation-for-grattan-2018.pdf?la=
en&hash=773503322C309EBA6E8722F4734EA8CE as a good example. Accessed online on
20 June 2021. Even though renewables are lowest cost, additional policies (such as Cfds using
the RET policy architecture) and voluntary purchases of abatement are required to hasten the
substitution of existing coal plants with ﬁrmed renewables in a manner consistent with meeting
Australia’s carbon budget implicitly committed to as part of the Paris agreement.

25 LGC prices have continued to be non-negative despite the RET being fully subscribed
from a compliance perspective. This is due to continued growth in demand from electricity
customers for LGCs to ‘oﬀset’ their electricity consumption. Appendix S3 shows how forward
LGC prices continue to trend above the fundamentals implied through a pure compliance lens.

and concluded that LGCs should be ‘fungible’ with ACCUs using the NEM

In 2001, Australia introduced legislation requiring investment in new renewable electricity generating
capacity. The legislation was signiﬁcantly expanded in 2009 to give effect to a 20% Renewable Energy
Target (RET). Importantly, the policy was introduced with bipartisan support and is consistent with
global policy trends. In this article, we examine the history of the policy and establish that the ‘stop/start’
nature of renewable policy development has resulted in investors withholding new capital until greater
certainty is provided. We utilise the methodology from Simshauser and Nelson (2012) to examine
whether capital market efﬁciency losses would occur under certain policy scenarios. The results show
that electricity costs would increase by between $51 million and $119 million if the large-scale RET is
abandoned even after accounting for avoided renewable costs. Our conclusions are clear: we ﬁnd that
policymakers should be guided by a high level public policy principle in relation to large-scale renewable
energy policy: constant review is not reform.

Introduction

Australia has signiﬁcant reserves of low-cost black coal, brown
coal and natural gas. This energy providence has sustained Australian
economic growth for much of the last century. However, as Jarvinen
et al. (2012, p.63) observed, Australian policy derivation is often
‘policy taking’ rather than ‘policy making’ due to the relatively small
size of Australia in terms of population, technology origination and
global inﬂuence. To that end, Australia has been one of 96 countries
that have embraced government policies designed to facilitate
greater investment in renewable energy technologies (BNEF, 2012)
fuel energy
despite the advantage of abundant low-cost fossil
reserves. Globally, concerns about energy security have motivated
policymakers to introduce mechanisms designed to deploy renew-
able energy. Within Australia, it would be reasonable to state that the

public policy objectives being pursued in relation to renewable
energy relate to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and diversifying
Australia's electricity supplies. This is in addition to market failures
associated with sub-optimal, inter-temporal, investment allocation
given the long-lived nature of electricity infrastructure, and a
bipartisan agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over
the long-term.

In 2011, approximately 90% of all electricity generated in
Australia was fuelled by either coal or gas (ESAA, 2012). The
remaining 10% was sourced from renewables with hydro-electric
generation producing around 7% and wind contributing around 3%
(ESAA, 2012). This result is different when compared to ten years
ago.
In 2000, coal and gas collectively powered 92% of all
electricity generation in Australia with hydro-electricity compris-
ing the remaining 8% (ESAA, 2000). Wind was almost non-existent
as a deployed technology within the Australian electricity market.
The critical difference between the years 2000 and 2011 was the
operation of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET).

The MRET was introduced in 2001 by the Commonwealth
Government with a public policy objective of increasing Australia's

T. Nelson et al. / Energy Policy 62 (2013) 386–400

387

renewable electricity generation by an ‘additional 2%’. It became
known as the ‘2% MRET’ policy and was successful in achieving its
public policy objective: the deployment of more renewable energy.
However, there have been several policy development ‘junctures’
where investor conﬁdence has been damaged due to ongoing
reviews and amendment of this policy. Since the passage of the
legislation underpinning the original MRET policy, there have been
two major amendments and ﬁve points of ‘review’ by policy-
makers. While one of these amendments could be thought of as
being unambiguously material – the expansion of the policy from
2% to 20% – the remaining reviews contributed little towards
providing a stable platform for investors to make long-term
decisions regarding renewable energy infrastructure. For a more
comprehensive outline of the history of Australia's renewable
energy policy see Nelson et al. (2011).

In addition to consistent uncertainty in relation to Australian
renewable energy policy, there has been the added uncertainty
created by the intense debate around climate change policy within
Australia. A thorough explanation of the history of Australian
climate change policy is provided by Nelson et al. (2012). Most
recently, on 1 July 2012, the Commonwealth Government intro-
duced a ﬁxed carbon price or carbon tax of $23 per tonne of carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) which will apply to all
industrial
facilities with emissions greater than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e. It is
intended that the ﬁxed price (which increases each year) will
apply for three years with an emissions trading scheme to
commence operation from 2015. This policy mechanism is
designed to deliver on the Government's policy objective –
reducing Australia's 2020 greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative
to 2000 levels. However, while the objective is shared by the
opposition (Liberal/National Coalition), the mechanism by which
to achieve the target is not. The opposition has committed to
repealing the carbon price legislation if elected to form Govern-
ment and will then implement a ‘direct action’
framework.
Accordingly, policy uncertainty exists in relation to the longevity
of carbon pricing in Australia.

The impact of carbon policy uncertainty has been quantiﬁed in
two aspects by Australian economists (a) suboptimal investment
decisions, and (b) suboptimal
investment costs relative to a
counterfactual scenario. Nelson et al. (2010) examined the costs
investment caused by
associated with the sub-optimal capital
carbon policy uncertainty. They found that the costs could be as
high as $2 billion per annum due to unnecessarily high electricity
prices. This research was tested by other economic modeling ﬁrms
and while the thesis was found to be correct, cost estimates varied.
Nelson, Simshauser, Orton and Kelley (2011) provide a summary of
these studies so we do not intend to replicate such analysis here.
On suboptimal investment costs, Simshauser and Nelson (2012)
estimated the capital market efﬁciency losses associated with
carbon policy uncertainty. Their project ﬁnance market survey
established that providers of debt ﬁnance would impose higher
risk premiums as a result of ongoing policy uncertainty in relation
to carbon pricing. The higher risk premiums would result in capital
market efﬁciency losses of up to $4.5 billion over the period
between 2015 and 2020.

It is in this context that this article considers approaches to
renewable energy public policy development in Australia, applying
the same methodology utilised by Simshauser and Nelson (2012)
to assess the capital market efﬁciency losses associated with
uncertainty in relation to the LRET. It is important to note that
this article is not intended to discuss the merits or otherwise of
renewable energy policy. This has been debated at length in the
Australian and international context (for example, see SKM-MMA,
2012). Rather, our analysis takes as given a renewable energy
policy in place for 11 years with legislated targets for the following
18 years.

This article is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the
evolution of large scale renewable energy policy in Australia and
associated global market developments; the supply and demand
for Large Scale Generation Certiﬁcates (LGCs) is presented in
Section 3; the results of a survey of renewable electricity market
participant views in relation to policy and pricing are documented
in Section 4; Section 5 analyses the capital market efﬁciency losses
associated with higher risk premiums being applied to new
developments; partial equilibrium analysis of electricity price
impacts related to ongoing policy uncertainty is presented in
Section 6; our policy recommendations are presented in Section
7 with concluding remarks provided subsequently.

2. The evolution of large-scale renewable energy policy in
Australia

The Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) was intro-
duced in Australia in 2001. The legislation underpinning the policy
was passed in 2000. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000
and Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001 required elec-
tricity retailers to purchase Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs)
to avoid paying a shortfall penalty of $40 per megawatt hour
(MWh) of renewable energy not acquired. Under MRET, new
renewable electricity generators constructed after 1997, and
incumbent renewable generators who generated power above
their historical baseline, were eligible to create RECs with one
REC equivalent to the generation of one MWh of renewable
energy. The legislation required retailers to progressively increase
their purchases of RECs so that by the year 2010, an additional
9500 MWh of new renewable generation would be produced. It
was forecast that the policy would add renewable generation
output equivalent to around two percent of electricity demand by
2010. It could be argued that the policy was effective in achieving
its objectives over its ﬁrst few years of existence as signiﬁcant new
investments in renewable energy capacity were made in biomass,
landﬁll gas and wind farms. Fig. 1 shows the new installed
renewable capacity (wind and non-wind) since 2001. This is in
addition to the roughly 1.5 GW of small scale solar PV installed
between 2001 and 2011.

In 2003, a review of the MRET legislation was initiated by the
Howard Government and conducted by a panel chaired by former
Senator Grant Tambling. The review came to be known as the
‘Tambling Review’ and heard from interested stakeholders about
the operation of the MRET since its inception in 2001. Recommen-
dations from the review included: the MRET measure to continue
to operate; MRET targets to continue to be expressed in GWh and
not as a percentage of overall electricity demand; MRET targets to
increase beyond 2010 and to stabilise at 20,000 GWh in 2020; and
the end date of the measure to be extended beyond 2020 so that
renewable energy projects receive RECs for a full 15 year period
presumably because such a tenor would align more closely to
project ﬁnancings (Australian Greenhouse Ofﬁce, 2004).

The Tambling Review provided its report to the Minister for the
Environment and Heritage in late 2003, which was tabled in
Parliament in early 2004. The Commonwealth Government made
a number of minor changes to the policy as a result of the
Tambling Review but the signiﬁcant recommendations outlined
above were largely ignored (Australian Greenhouse Ofﬁce, 2004).
When considered in the context of global renewable energy policy,
this is not surprising. Renewable energy investment at the time
was relatively small by comparison to investment in thermal
coal-ﬁred and gas-ﬁred power generation. This is shown in
Fig. 2. Global renewable energy investment (LHS) and the ratio
of global thermal to renewable investment (RHS) are plotted for
the years 2004 through 2011. In 2004, when the Commonwealth

Government largely rejected many of the recommendations of the
Tambling Review, investment in new thermal electricity genera-
tion was around 3.5 times greater than investment in new renew-
able electricity capacity.

Fig. 2 shows that between 2004 and 2007 there was a rapid
run-up in global renewable energy investment and a signiﬁcant
decline in the ratio of thermal to renewable investment. This
coincides with a rising number of countries around the globe
introducing renewable energy targets. While the Commonwealth
Government had ruled out increasing the MRET, various state
governments initiated their own policy frameworks designed to
support the uptake of renewable energy. In 2006, the Victorian
Government legislated the Victorian Renewable Energy Target
(VRET) and the New South Wales Government developed (but
did not legislate) the New South Wales Renewable Energy Target
(NRET). Both policies were effectively duplicates of the MRET
policy with higher targets, whereby a liability was placed on
retailers incentivising the development of new renewable energy
through tradable certiﬁcation.

The 2007 Commonwealth election saw both major political
parties put ambitious clean energy policies to the electorate. The
incumbent Howard Government outlined an expansion of the
MRET to achieve 15% ‘clean’ energy production by 2020.
In
addition to expanding the targets under the MRET, the eligibility
criteria was to be amended to allow ‘effectively zero emission’
technologies such as coal and gas generation with carbon capture
and storage. The Rudd Opposition proposed an expansion of the
MRET targets to achieve 20% renewable energy production by
2020. Regardless, both the incumbent Government and the Oppo-
sition pledged to introduce emissions trading and expand renew-
able energy policies. However, a key point that was noted by all
market participants was the broad-based bipartisan agreement
related to anthropogenic climate change and renewable energy
policies.

Policy certainty did not occur immediately. The Rudd Govern-
ment took almost two years to legislate a relatively simple set of
amendments required to give effect to the expanded 20% Renew-
able Energy Target, lifting the ﬁxed energy target signiﬁcantly

from 9500 GWh to 41,000 GWh.1 However, the legislation passed
in August 2009 also contained a number of material changes to the
design of the original MRET legislation. The most notable of these
was the Solar Credits Multiplier. While small-scale solar PV
generation (residential solar) had historically been able to create
RECs for ﬁfteen years of generation upfront (known as ‘deeming’),
the Solar Credits Multiplier allowed installers of small scale solar
PV to create ﬁve times the number of these certiﬁcates. In effect,
residential solar PV was receiving 75 years worth of certiﬁcates
immediately while all other generation types (e.g.
large-scale
biomass, solar, landﬁll gas and wind) only created RECs as the
actual energy was generated.

At the same time, premium feed-in tariffs for small-scale solar
PV units were being introduced by most Australian state govern-
ments. Table 1 outlines the premium feed-in tariff policies that
were in place in 2010 in each jurisdiction. With the introduction of
the Solar Credits Multiplier and the various premium feed-in tariff
policies, the payback for installing small-scale solar PV was
between 2 and 9 years. With such attractive investment returns,
installation of small-scale solar PV systems signiﬁcantly increased.
The result of these distortions was an effective ‘crowding out’ of
other renewable energy technology options within the RET and an
associated slump in prices due to the material oversupply of RECs.
Fig. 3 shows the annual creation of RECs by generation type
since 2005 (LHS). Note in 2010 that the actual target under the
MRET policy had a demand of 9.5 million certiﬁcates but about 40
million were actually created/supplied, primarily through the
distortionary effects of the Solar Credits Multiplier, or ‘phantom
RECs’ as they became known. The combination of the Solar Credits
Multiplier and state-based premium feed-in tariff policies resulted
in approximately 500 MW of new installed residential solar PV
capacity over the same period (RHS). The RET policy framework
was not incentivising new renewable energy development other
than residential solar PV, but the annual production of renewable
energy was only 1/75 of the certiﬁcates created because, as noted
earlier, the 15-year output from such units is deemed up-front,
and was then multiplied ﬁve times over. Unsurprisingly, REC prices
plunged from around $50 in April 2009 to just $28 per REC in late-
2009 as Fig. 4 later reveals. With wholesale electricity prices in the
various National Electricity Market
regions in 2009
between $33/MWh and $55/MWh, combined revenue from whole-
sale and REC pricing was well short of the roughly $120/MWh
required to bank a new wind farm project at that time.

(NEM)

In late-2009 and early-2010, there were a number of vocal critics of
the newly designed RET. The signiﬁcant disquiet from large-scale
renewable energy producers about the unintended consequences of
the Solar Credits Multiplier and complementary premium feed-in
tariff policies resulted in the Government (with Opposition support)
announcing fundamental changes to the operation of the policy.

1 Following passage of the amendments giving effect to the expansion of the

MRET, the policy became known as the Renewable Energy Target (RET).

In February 2010, the Commonwealth Government announced that
the RET would be split into two new policies: the Large-Scale
Renewable Energy Target (LRET) and the Small-Scale Renewable
Energy Scheme (SRES). The LRET would operate in the same way that
the RET and its predecessor MRET had operated – ﬁxed GWh targets
applied to liable entities with Large-Scale Generation Certiﬁcates
(LGCs) replacing RECs as the certiﬁcate eligible to be traded. However,
only large-scale generation would be eligible to create LGCs for the
41,000 GWh target in 2020. The SRES would allow installers of small-
scale renewable generation (i.e. solar PV units) to create ﬁxed price
$40/MWh certiﬁcates for their deemed abatement with liable entities
(electricity retailers) required to purchase them at rates prescribed by
the independent regulator.

These changes were legislated in June 2010. One of the amend-
ments negotiated during the legislative review process related to
ongoing ‘statutory review’ of the policy. Section 162 of the Renew-
able Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (the legislation underpinning the
LRET and SRES) requires an independent statutory review to be
conducted every two years and presented to Parliament. The ﬁrst of
these reviews was conducted by the newly established Climate
Change Authority and completed on 19 December 2012. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, and indeed ironically, 12 months prior to this
current review, the market essentially closed down for business
due to low certiﬁcate prices and heightened uncertainty that
prevailed due to the review itself. The consequences for market
pricing of renewable energy are highlighted in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 shows the prices of LGCs (formerly RECs) from 2003 to
2012 (LHS). Also shown is the average revenue that would have
been earned by a large scale renewable energy generator from
LGCs and the average wholesale energy price in South Australia in
that year. It should be noted that the long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) of the most economic renewable technology (wind) is
currently about $90–$100 per MWh. Two things are clear from this
graph. First, the market for LGCs responds signiﬁcantly to move-
ments in government policy. Three examples are highlighted:
(a) the rapid run up in LGC prices in 2007 as a result of an election
in which political parties were effectively seeking to ‘out-bid’ each
other in relation to support for renewable energy policy; (b) the
signiﬁcant fall in prices in 2009 as the combination of the Solar
Credits Multiplier and premium feed-in tariffs resulted in signiﬁ-
cant oversupply of certiﬁcates; and (c) the fall in prices in 2010
associated with emerging knowledge of the extent of the over-
supply of RECs that would be carried into the LGC market. And
second, relative policy certainty is required for the combined LGC
and wholesale market revenue to equal or exceed the LRMC of
developing renewable energy in Australia.

The review of policy history in this section highlights the
particularly volatile nature of large-scale renewable energy policy
development since 2001 within Australia. Speciﬁcally, the original
MRET legislation has been materially amended twice in ten years
and reviewed publicly by policymakers on at least four occasions.
The logical question that follows is whether investor and market
participant perceptions of the market have been skewed towards
expecting further legislative or regulatory change.

3. Supply and demand for large scale generation certiﬁcates

Economic theory dictates that the price of an LGC today should
reﬂect the difference between the wholesale electricity price and
the long-run marginal cost of the most economic renewable
energy project at the point of time where new renewable genera-
tion is required due to LGC supply falling short of demand
(discounted to current prices). Accordingly, we have constructed
a simple model of LGC supply and demand to test whether the
price today reﬂects the underlying fundamentals of the market.

The demand and supply for LGCs in our model in any year (y) is
calculated using Eq. (3.1) (demand) and Eq. (3.2) (supply)

DLGC ¼ DRET þ DGP þ DV

ð3:1Þ

where DRET is equal to legislated targets under the Renewable
Energy (Electricity) Act in year (y); DP is equal to yearly demand for
Green Power (projected forward unchanged)2; and DV is equal to
yearly demand for other renewable energy (e.g. known large
contracts).3

SLGC ¼ SCS þ SW þ SH þ SO þ SNW

ð3:2Þ

where SCS is equal to the cumulative surplus of LGCs carried
forward from y (cid:3) 14 ; SW is equal to the annual supply produced by
existing wind turbines; SH is equal to the annual supply produced
by existing hydro generators; SO is equal to the annual supply
produced by other existing renewable generators; and SNW is equal
to the annual supply produced by wind turbines under construc-
tion today.

Balancing Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) in each year (y) produces either a
surplus of LGCs carried forward to y+1 as cumulative surplus or a
deﬁcit carried forward as new supply required. At the beginning of
the modeling period (2012), we have assumed a cumulative
surplus of 32 million LGCs. This is based upon the surplus of
certiﬁcates available at the end of the 2011 compliance period.

Fig. 5. Modeled supply and demand of LGCs from 2012 to 2020.

Fig. 5 shows the results of our modeling of the supply and
demand of LGCs from 2012 to 2020. The signiﬁcant existing
surplus of LGCs in 2012 is gradually absorbed by increasing
demand despite a small amount of new supply through commis-
sioning of projects currently under construction. However, new
supply (from new projects not yet under construction) is not
required until 2015. Beyond 2015, the signiﬁcant increase in
legislated targets under LRET results in rapidly increasing new
build requirements. By 2020, an additional 32 million certiﬁcates
are required to be produced each year to ensure compliance with
the scheme. This is the equivalent of approximately 9000 MW of
new renewable energy capacity (assuming 35–40% capacity factors
and median output from existing ﬂeet of renewable plant). Over
the 6 years between 2015 and 2020 (inclusive), implied annual
new investment is therefore around 1500 MW or $3.3 billion
assuming an ‘all-in’ overnight capital cost of $2200/kW for new
wind (ANZ, 2011).

Our modeling has shown that new renewable generation is
required in 2015. Based upon this observation, we are now able to
calculate the implied LGC price today. As outlined earlier, the price
of an LGC certiﬁcate today should reﬂect the difference between
the wholesale electricity price and the LRMC of the most economic
renewable energy project in 2015 (discounted). Based upon a wind
LRMC of $99/MWh5 (inﬂated by 2.5% to account for inﬂation and
expressed in 2015 dollars)6 and a 2015 forward electricity contract
price (PE) of $55/MWh,7 we can use Eq. (3.3) to solve the efﬁcient
LGC price.
LRMC ¼ PLGC þ PE
$107/MWh¼PLGC+$55/MWh, PLGC¼$52 per certiﬁcate (2015 dollars).
Discounting this price using a discount rate for the ‘cost of
carry’ for the three years between 2015 and 2012 is inherently
difﬁcult given the number of diverse participants in the market

ð3:3Þ

5 We have based our estimate of the LRMC of wind utilising project ﬁnancing
results from a subsequent section within this article. The estimate would be at the
low conservative end of a spread of low, medium and high estimates.

6 It is reasonable to utilise current capital costs for wind given that a two year
construction timeframe would require ﬁnancial close for new projects to be
completed in 2013 (less than a year from the time of writing) to ensure that the
shortfall of LGCs in 2015 is met. Wind is currently the most economic large-scale
renewable energy opportunity in Australia.

with varying costs of ﬁnance.8 Accordingly, we have used a 7–10%
discount rate range to determine that the efﬁcient price of LGC
certiﬁcates in 2012 is in the range of $39 to $42. This can be
contrasted with the price of LGC certiﬁcates being $36 at the time
of this calculation. Based upon this analysis, it would appear that
LGC market participants either: disagree with the fundamentals
presented in this paper; or they believe the market structure is
likely to be changed through further legislative or regulatory
change, thereby diminishing LGC value. In our view prices are
well below those implied by market fundamentals. The efﬁcient
price (based upon market fundamentals and assuming perfect
information) is 8–17% higher than the actual market price depend-
it is
ing upon the discount rate used. Given this disparity,
necessary to consider why market participants are not acting on
this clear arbitrage opportunity and increasing demand for LGCs to
reﬂect the economic disparity between actual and our estimate of
efﬁcient pricing. Our hypothesis is that the continuing review and
change to the large-scale renewable energy policy outlined in
Section 2 has led to a belief among market participants that, in
aggregate, ongoing policy changes will occur and thus any appar-
ent arbitrage opportunity may well be nothing more than ‘a
mirage’. Accordingly, prices have and will continue to trade at a
discount to the ‘efﬁcient’ price because investors must, based on
historical experience, wait to see the government response to the
legislative review by the Climate Change Authority before they
commit scarce debt and equity capital to meet the underlying
policy objective function.

4. Market participant views on the LGC market

To suggest that a genuine price arbitrage exists, is well known
but is not being cleared by a market of buyers and sellers requires
more than a casual observation to be credible. To that end, we
conducted a survey of LGC market participants in mid-2012 to

8 The carryover of Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs) into the Large-Scale
Renewable Target when it was established in 2010 has resulted in a diverse group
of investors holding LGCs. Banks, merchant generators, retailers, vertically inte-
grated utilities and individual investors are all holders of LGCs. Accordingly, we
have used a discount rate range (7–10%) to reﬂect the full range of ﬁnance costs
that these participants may face.

conﬁrm whether the existence of an arbitrage exists, and if so, to
test whether ‘policy uncertainty’ is the key issue preventing the
arbitrage from being cleared by the market efﬁciently. Two sets of
market participants were invited to participate in the survey: (1)
large-scale renewable energy developers and the buyers of the
certiﬁcates (i.e. energy retailers); and (2) project ﬁnancing profes-
sionals. The survey responses for the ﬁrst group of respondents
were facilitated by the Energy Retailers Association of Australia
(ERAA) and the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to remove any bias
associated with knowledge of the authors. 11 ﬁrms responded and
given the relatively small number of materially substantive parti-
cipants in the sector, we believe this sample size is in fact quite
robust because we understand that the most signiﬁcant partici-
pants (by market share) have been included in the sample. That
said, we acknowledge that such a small size requires further
validation of results which we provide in the following analysis.
The second group of respondents was contacted directly. The
survey size for project ﬁnancing professionals was 14 banks and
10 responses were received representing a response rate of 71%.
The results of the survey of large-scale renewable energy devel-
opers and electricity retailers are presented in Table 2.

The results contained in Table 2 conﬁrm that ongoing policy
uncertainty is impeding the efﬁcient clearing and indeed, func-
tioning of the LGC market. The mean of responses indicates that
market participants expect that new generation will be required to
be operational by 2015 to ensure that demand is met. These views
of market participants align with our modeling presented in
Section 3, which is important given our earlier comments on the
existence of market arbitrage. The mean of responses provided in
relation to the ‘efﬁcient’ market price was the price band $45–$50
per certiﬁcate, signiﬁcantly above the current market price of $36
per certiﬁcate. Again, this aligns closely with our modeling in

Section 3 which produced an ‘efﬁcient’ market price of $39 to $42
per certiﬁcate (depending upon the discount rate applied). It is
likely that our lower estimate of the ‘efﬁcient’ market price
relative to the views of those surveyed is a function of our estimate
of the LRMC of wind being at the conservative (low) end of the full
spectrum of estimates of wind LRMC within the industry (perhaps
due to locational or intermittency discounts).

While we would not suggest such results could be relied upon
as conclusive, they are, in our opinion, persuasive in relation to our
hypothesis being robust.
Importantly, the majority of market
participants were of the view that the disparity of pricing between
implied efﬁcient prices based on market fundamentals and actual
prices is the result of ongoing policy uncertainty – speciﬁcally
carbon pricing and the LRET. When asked whether the LRET
should be amended through the legislative review process under-
taken by the Climate Change Authority, 10 out of the 11 partici-
pants surveyed stated that it should not be amended. Importantly,
the results of our analysis of this relatively small sample (by
number of participants) are supported by others including ROAM
Consulting (2012) and environmental market brokers such as
Nextgen (2012) who noted that, “given the history of regulatory
change that has occurred over the last ﬁve years in particular, having
conﬁdence in the long term appearance of the LRET is no easy thing.”
Importantly, our results are not speciﬁc to LRET market partici-
pants. Project ﬁnancing professionals provided similar responses
as Table 3 demonstrates.

Table 3 shows that electricity generation project ﬁnancing
professionals have similar views on the LGC market to LGC market
participants – bearing in mind that project ﬁnanciers have
an especially acute understanding of market conditions given
facilities are illiquid and particularly long-dated.

environmental markets to assess the business case for providing
funding to any new or existing piece of energy infrastructure.
Project ﬁnancing professionals expect that new generation will be
required from 2015 and that the price of LGCs should be between
$45 and $50 per certiﬁcate at the time of writing (albeit with a
signiﬁcantly greater variance of pricing expectations than LGC
market participants). Based upon the mean, these results mirror
those of the market participants. In relation to the reasoning
behind the misalignment between market fundamentals and
pricing, the majority of respondents stated that uncertainty about
the legislative review of LRET and the longevity of carbon pricing
policy are key factors. It is unsurprising given the similarity of
views on these issues that the majority of project ﬁnanciers do not
support further changes to LRET through the Climate Change
Authority legislative review.

5. Capital market efﬁciency losses and policy uncertainty

Policy uncertainty is evidently present within the large-scale
renewable energy industry. There is a rich and detailed existing
economic literature related to the costs of policy uncertainty in
Australia's electricity markets (see for example Nelson et al, 2010;
Frontier Economics, 2010; Sinclair Knight Merz, 2011a; Deloitte,
2011; Nelson et al, 2012a; and Simshauser and Nelson, 2012). Two
basic implications of ongoing public policy uncertainty on the
electricity industry have been explored. Firstly, the impact of sub-
optimal investment in new generation capacity has been exam-
ined. As electricity generation is highly capital intensive, it is
necessary to take a long-term view of market fundamentals and
regulatory and legislative stability to ensure that capital is not
stranded. Secondly, the impacts of capital market efﬁciency losses
have been examined.

It is the second form of uncertainty related to capital market
efﬁciency losses that we address in this article. Given the results
presented in Section 4 indicate that the market is concerned that
further changes to the LRET policy may be made as a result of a
government response to the Climate Change Authority's legislative
review, it is appropriate to ask whether actual material amend-
ment of the policy in 2013 would result in additional risk
premiums being applied to large-scale renewable energy invest-
ments. The framework applied by Simshauser and Nelson (2012) is
useful for answering such a question. We have adopted this
framework in the current section to determine whether further
amendment of the LRET will result in capital market efﬁciency
losses.

the NEM has more than
20,000 MW of privately owned (i.e. pre-existing and new entrant)
generating plant and around 17,000 MW (85%) of this is project
ﬁnanced. With such a heavy reliance upon project ﬁnancing,
spreads on syndicated project debt provide a speciﬁc and relevant
insight
the risks
associated with investment in electricity generation infrastructure.
This is important for two reasons. First, historically much of the
plant introduced since the creation of the NEM in the late 1990s
has been project ﬁnanced. Second, and looking forward, while it
may well be true that the large retailer/developers (i.e. AGL
Energy, Origin Energy, TRUenergy) may be theoretically able to
raise on-balance sheet ﬁnance from debt capital markets to avoid
the use of project ﬁnance, such an outcome may lead to a
substantial concentration of renewable plant ownership. In a well
functioning market for new plant, a material proportion of the
large investment required under LRET should be project ﬁnanced

and undertaken by Independent Power Producers if for no other
reason than the predictable balance sheet and investment con-
centration constraints of those large retailer/developers – hence
our interest in broader bank debt spreads.

The results of the Simshauser and Nelson (2012) survey are
presented in Table 4. Note the signiﬁcant increase in Project
Finance (PF) spreads for electricity generation from 2008 to 2011
relative to those of BBB bonds (down only 11% compared to 33%).9
BBB bonds were used as a comparator. While corporate bonds are
not necessarily good substitutes for PF, the relative change in
pricing of both debt instruments is of course entirely relevant.
They found that the most logical explanation of the elevated
spreads relative to local and global comparators was the ongoing
policy uncertainty on greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion of
the study was that the higher spreads arising from carbon pricing
uncertainty would result
in increased electricity prices for
consumers.

The 2012 study noted that volumes in syndicated debt markets
retreated signiﬁcantly during the ‘great recession’ of 2008 and
2009. While markets have rebounded, the most recent observa-
tions point to further potential retreats due to ongoing concerns
about economic conditions in Europe and the fragility of some
banking industries. Fig. 6 shows total syndicated debt transactions
broken down by quarter and year since 2004. While 2011 saw a
signiﬁcant
the ‘great recession’, quarter on
quarter trends for 2012 reveal a subsequent retreat in syndicated
debt.

turnaround post

This has non-trivial implications for Australian energy markets
given around half of Australian investment funding (debt and
equity) is sourced internationally as Simshauser and Catt (2012)
noted. Simshauser and Catt (2012) estimate that between 2010
and 2015, $85.9 billion in capital will be required within the
electricity supply system. Capital
investment on new network
infrastructure and upgrades to existing equipment was forecast
to hit $43 billion. Fully $33.6 billion was projected for reﬁnancing
of existing network infrastructure while $9.4 billion was forecast
to be used to reﬁnance existing power stations.
In addition,
incremental capital between 2012 and 2020 related to the LRET
is likely to be between $20 billion and $30 billion.

This vast capital inﬂow requirement within Australia needs to
be assessed within a domestic capital market which is increasingly
skewed towards energy and resources. Fig. 7 shows private capital
investment in mining, manufacturing and other industries since
2000. Fig. 7 illustrates that capital expenditure on mining has risen
by around 100% since 2009. It is therefore critical that considera-
tion be given to the importance of capital inﬂows for ﬁnancing
resource and energy projects – a thematic identiﬁed in Simshauser

9 The Project Finance (PF) spreads for electricity generation effectively repre-

sent the speciﬁc cost of ﬁnancing electricity generation infrastructure.

(2010b). As a consequence of credit concentration limits, domestic
banks are simply incapable of funding all new capital expenditure
in the sector. Given the vast capital ﬁnancing requirements of the
electricity sector between now and 2020 and potential constraints
in global syndicated debt activity as a result of global economic
conditions (and indeed Basel III reforms), it is paramount that
energy policymakers consider the impacts of policy uncertainty on
the attractiveness of Australia (and the Australian energy sector in
particular) as a destination. Intense competition for capital both
domestically (between sectors) and internationally (between
countries) underscores the importance of maintaining policy
stability for investors in electricity infrastructure with long-lived
asset lives.

To test whether policy uncertainty in relation to large-scale
renewable energy would result in distortions related to pricing of
infrastructure by these capital markets, we conducted a survey
of project ﬁnancing professionals as noted in Section 4. The results
of this survey are presented in Table 5.

The results of the survey presented in Table 5 are consistent
with the thematic identiﬁed in Simshauser and Nelson (2012).
Respondents indicated that policy uncertainty (measured by
material amendment to the LRET) would result in ﬁnancing
‘premium penalties’ being applied to both new renewable and
new gas-ﬁred generation projects, which is to be expected. The
mean response was the band 51–100 bps providing an effective
mean of 75 bps above the reasonable credit margin over BBSW in
2012 of 275 bps.

We have applied these survey results to the PF Model utilised
in Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and documented in Nelson and
Simshauser (2013) to examine how changes in ﬁnancing para-
meters impact on the underlying cost structures of baseload/
intermediate combined cycle gas turbine plant (CCGT), renewable
projects (wind) and peaking open cycle gas turbines (OCGT). We
have used the same range of assumptions published in Table 7 of
Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and so we do not intend to
reproduce them here. One key variation is a lower capital turbine

cost for wind at $2200/kW, compared to $2500/kW in the 2012
study.10 Three scenarios have been modeled

1. Certainty scenario: In this scenario, we assume that the Climate
Change Authority recommendation of no substantive changes
to the operation of the LRET is supported by government, and
critically, bi-partisan support for the policy in its current form
continues.11 Spreads on project ﬁnanced power generation
facilities reﬂect uncertainty in relation to carbon pricing but
not uncertainty in relation to renewable policy. This results in
credit margins of 275 bps over BBSW and enables ﬁrms to
secure longer facility tenors. Gas input pricing for CCGT is
assumed to be steady at $4.50/GJ.

2. Uncertainty scenario: Key assumptions in this scenario relate to
government implementing “material changes” to the operation
of the LRET. Bi-partisan support for the policy in its current
form evaporates, resulting in genuine policy uncertainty for
investors. Spreads on project facilities reﬂect both uncertainty
in relation to carbon pricing, and uncertainty in relation to
large-scale renewables. Credit margins
development of
increase by 75 bps to 350 bps over BBSW, and facility tenors
are reduced, which heightens reﬁnancing risks and reduces
achievable debt levels within the capital structure of projects.
Gas input pricing for CCGT remains unchanged and steady at
$4.50/GJ.

3. High gas scenario: Primary assumptions in this scenario are that
as in the certainty scenario, the Climate Change Authority
recommendations of no material changes to the operation of
the LRET are adopted and bi-partisan support for the policy in
its current form continues. Spreads on project-ﬁnanced power
generation facilities reﬂect uncertainty in relation to carbon
pricing but not uncertainty in relation to renewable policy. This
results in credit margins of 275 bps over BBSW. However, gas
input pricing for CCGT signiﬁcantly increases from $4.50/GJ to
$10.00/GJ reﬂecting high global demand for natural gas and the
linkage of previously isolated Australian east-coast domestic
gas markets with LNG pricing (see Simshauser et al., 2011 for
further information on structural gas pricing shocks in Austra-
lia). Carbon pricing of $15/tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is
also included in fuel costs. This scenario has been included to
reﬂect consideration of issues related to gas pricing raised by
Riesz and Tourneboeuf (2012), which as our partial equilibrium
analysis subsequently reveals, is critically important for policy-
makers to consider.

10 Most recent observations for wind capital costs indicate prices are even
lower (see Trustpower (2012) which indicates pricing at $1630/kW). However, we
are uncertain as to whether such pricing includes the full cost of construction, and
speciﬁcally, items such as interest during construction, owners project develop-
ment costs, grid connection and so on. Accordingly, we have opted to use estimates
based on information provided in BREE (2012).

11 For further information on the Climate Change Authority's recommenda-
tions to leave the policy largely unchanged, see Climate Change Authority (2012).

The PF Model results for these three scenarios are presented in
Fig. 8. Gearing is applied relatively consistently at between 60%
and 63%. This represents the main variation in application from
Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and explains the higher returns to
equity and lower interest payments in each of the results for the
200 MW wind project. Financing is provided using 5, 7, 10 and 12
year tenors depending upon the scenario and technology.

Fig. 8 shows that, unsurprisingly, the unit cost of a 200 MW
wind project increases by $4.20/MWh (4.3%) from $98.57/MWh to
$102.77/MWh with the introduction of policy uncertainty. Impor-
tantly, the unit cost of a 1 (cid:4) 400 MW CCGT project also increases
by $0.73/MWh (1.1%) from $64.32/MWh to $65.05/MWh under the
same conditions. The most material change in unit cost occurs
with the signiﬁcant increase in gas pricing where CCGT costs
increase to $103.22/MWh (i.e. above the cost of wind).

Due to the different operating duties of an OCGT (peaking)
plant, the ﬁnancing results are very different to those of a CCGT, as
shown in Fig. 9, which presents the ‘carrying cost’ or ‘total ﬁxed
costs’ (including a normal return on funds invested) for a 525 MW
plant comprising three units. This can be thought of as the fair
value of a $300/MWh call option written by new entrant peaking
plant. The incremental cost of an OCGT in moving from certainty
to uncertainty (scenario 1 to scenario 2) is $0.44/MWh.

6. Partial equilibrium analysis – policy uncertainty and
electricity prices

To assess the economic impact of our different scenarios on
electricity prices, we assume ﬁnancing costs calculated in previous
sections begin to bind immediately from the date at which
legislative change in response to the Climate Change Authority
review is proposed (i.e. 2013). For simplicity, we have assumed
that any legislative change would be announced in late 2013 and
implemented in 2014. Higher LRMC costs associated with policy
change would be revealed in the market from 2017 onwards as
new plant is commissioned (and in practice, as existing plant is
reﬁnanced). CCGT forms the dominant base and intermediate load
technology while OCGT undertakes peaking duties.

We utilise the Optimal Plant Mix Model (OPM Model) from
Simshauser and Wild (2009) to undertake the analysis. This partial
equilibrium electricity system model simulates half-hour resolu-
tion and assumes perfect competition and essentially free entry to
install any combination of capacity that satisﬁes differentiable
conditions. As this model has been documented in Simshauser and
Wild (2009), we do not intend to reproduce the details here.
A static graphical representation of the half-hourly modelling
results is presented in Fig. 10.

Demand has been projected utilising the latest forecasts from
the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO, 2012). These
forecasts account for the recent declines in energy demand
associated with adoption of embedded solar PV, energy efﬁciency
schemes and responsiveness to higher retail prices driven by
increased network costs. Average growth in annual energy for

the ten year period out to 2022 is now forecast to be 1.7%, down
from the previous forecast of 2.3% in 2011. We utilise the
methodology outlined in Nelson et al. (2010) to distribute the
average annual growth of 1.7% across deciles of actual 2011 NEM
demand ranked by time.

The three scenarios outlined in the previous section have each
been modeled using the partial equilibrium framework discussed
above. One additional scenario has also been modeled based upon
material adjustment of the LRET targets to reﬂect recent commen-
tary related to electricity demand being softer than anticipated
when the LRET was ﬁrst legislated. Origin Energy (2012) made the
salient point that with softening electricity demand, the RET
would result in more than 20% of Australia's electricity being
sourced from renewable sources, at least given most recent
forecast information.

The power generation system cost results for each scenario are
presented in Table 6. The certainty scenario results in a system

average cost of $69.17/MWh between 2017 and 2021. The intro-
duction of policy uncertainty results in average system costs
increasing by $0.69/MWh (1.00%) to $69.86/MWh. If the high gas
scenario were to materialise, average system costs would increase
by $33.88/MWh (49%) to $103.05/MWh. Additional costs of oper-
ating higher LRMC renewable plant are revealed in LGC costs
which our subsequent analysis examines.

Table 6 notes that uncertainty results in higher costs associated
with servicing projected future demand. However, this ignores any
potential savings associated with reductions in LGC costs incurred
by retailers, then passed through to customers as reductions in
prices. These cost savings are signiﬁcant. We have utilised an
LRMC methodology represented graphically in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11 shows the revenues that a wind turbine would earn, on
average. Note that these revenues come from two sources: (1) from
the wholesale energy market and (2) from the sale of LGCs. These
two income streams can be thought of as the components that

comprise an appropriately priced Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA). We have assumed away any penalty applied to wind in
wholesale energy markets related to the intermittency of output.
We consider this to be a reasonable assumption given the
relatively modest penalties identiﬁed by Simshauser (2011) in
relation to intermittent wind generation, and the fact that most
other plants will face equivalent intermittency issues in any event.
To calculate the net costs to society of uncertainty created by
material amendment to the LRET, we have contrasted reduced LGC
costs to 2021 with higher wholesale energy costs associated with
the results of our partial equilibrium analysis. Effectively, we have
created two scenarios

(cid:1) Uncertainty: In the uncertainty scenario, we have assumed that
LRET targets beyond 2016 are not increased at all. Effectively,
this scenario simulates a situation where the LRET policy is
repealed. However, it presumes that existing investments are
grandfathered (including projects committed through to 2014).
Higher wholesale energy costs (outlined in Table 6 previously)

are incurred due to investor perceptions of regulatory risk as a
result of the material amendment of the policy. However, these
higher costs are somewhat offset by the reduced LGC liability
between 2017 and 2021 as a result of repeal of the LRET
legislation.12

(cid:1) Uncertainty (low demand): For the uncertainty (low demand)
scenario, we have assumed that LRET targets are reduced in
2014 to reﬂect softening projections of electricity demand in
2020 and a desire to achieve no more than 20% renewable
electricity by 2020 given lower demand forecasts. Using the
logic in Origin (2012), we have reduced the targets between
2016 and 2020 to ensure a linear approach to 27 TWh in 2020,
down from 41 TWh. Higher wholesale energy costs (outlined in
Table 6 previously) are incurred due to investor perceptions of
regulatory risk as a result of the material amendment of the
policy. However, these higher costs are somewhat offset by the
reduced LGC liability between 2017 and 2021 as a result of
lower LRET targets relative to current legislation.13

Our results for the two scenarios identiﬁed above are presented

in Fig. 12.

Fig. 12 shows the costs and beneﬁts associated with signiﬁ-
cantly amending the LRET. While lower LGC costs are incurred in

12 As our analysis is for the NEM, we have reduced the LGC liability in our
modeling by 10% to reﬂect that the Western Australian and Northern Territory LGC
liabilities are not relevant (around 10% of national electricity demand).

pricing in 2017 ($64.32/MWh compared to $55/MWh for 2015 energy futures contracts available at the time of writing). For our modeling, we have used the actual yearly
estimates produced through our partial equilibrium analysis (rather than the cost of a CCGT or average wholesale prices).

both scenarios, the higher wholesale energy costs, as identiﬁed in
Table 6, are greater. The end result is a net cost to the consumer of
$51 million (NPV 2012$) if the LRET is effectively repealed. Of
course, the costs associated with this scenario would ultimately
dissipate, while the beneﬁts would more than likely be sustained.
And so over the very long run, these results might reverse,
although this is dependent upon Australia's policy of repealing
the LRET being consistent with global trends (which based upon
evidence presented in Section 2 appears somewhat unlikely). But
over the period of our examination, that is, from 2012 to 2021,
there would be a net cost to consumers from repealing the policy,
even with a grandfathering of existing projects. If the LRET target
was reduced to change with ﬂuctuating demand, the net cost to
consumers was found to be $119 million (NPV 2012$) over the
period 2012–2021. While these results appear counter-intuitive,
they are a simple function of the fact that there are real costs
associated with policy uncertainty.

7. Policy recommendations

In its ﬁnal report, the Climate Change Authority recommended
no material changes be made to the LRET policy. A key ﬁnding of
this article is that this ﬁnding is robust. Material amendments to
the policy would result in heightened uncertainty in relation to
energy policy with resultant costs being applied by ﬁnanciers of
power generation, and a further widening of the theoretical to
actual prices. According to the modelling presented here, these
costs would manifest themselves as higher costs to consumers –
up to $119 million (NPV 2012$) between 2017 and 2021, and
sharper run-up in LRET prices when shortages inevitably occur.14

14 We acknowledge the somewhat arbitrary nature of modeling between 2017
and 2021. However, we expect that analysis beyond 2021 would not be relevant
given that higher costs applied by project ﬁnanciers would eventually abate.

We have not considered the merits of ﬁrst principle public policy
objectives in relation to large-scale renewable energy policy.
Instead, we have looked at the market as it exists today and found
that amendment of the policy framework designed to alleviate
pricing pressures would be a more expensive option for electricity
consumers and society than leaving the current policy in place.
Investors in power generation require stable policy frameworks
and amendment to a policy which is designed to underpin
infrastructure investment for the next 20 years will not be
welcomed by most investors. International Power (reported in
Maher, 2012) drew the obvious conclusion

“Over $6 billion of investment has to date been made in renewable
generation and investors (both Australian and international) have
relied on the RET legislation remaining in full force and effect.
Stable legislation (and regulation) is required for large scale
capital intensive infrastructure whether this is renewable genera-
tion and/or fossil-ﬁred generation. If legislation is changed, then it
sets a worrying precedent that the legislative/regulatory goalposts
will be moved again and again over the next 20 to 30 years.”

In addition to our broad conclusions in relation to policy
certainty, we believe the dynamic discussed by Riesz and
Tourneboeuf (2012) in relation to uncertainties about gas pricing
requires greater consideration. Policymakers should have regard to
all of the factors which may result in wholesale energy price
pressures when considering the merits of renewable energy. The
nature of the NEM with its uniform, ﬁrst-price, energy-only gross
pool auction design means that plant with very low short-run
marginal costs (such as wind farms) have little or even negative
impacts on pool prices. Conversely, the cost structure of a gas-ﬁred
plant is a direct function of the gas price. Our research has shown
that a signiﬁcant increase in gas prices could result in gas-ﬁred
plant becoming more expensive than wind. We do not make
conclusions about the likelihood of this occurring, only that
renewable energy with no fuel cost should be contrasted with
gas in this environment.

Fig. 13 shows indices for gas prices and capital expenditure for
wind, OCGT and CCGT for the period 2000 to 2011. There are
several conclusions that can be drawn by policy makers in relation
to future pricing. Firstly, wind turbine prices are trending down
while gas prices are trending up. Secondly, capital expenditure
trends for OCGT, CCGT and wind are relatively similar.
It is
reasonable to state that the most recent pricing for turbines is
likely to be temporary given the somewhat unusually high $A
driven by international investor appetite for Australian denomi-
nated sovereign debt.15 The trends in Fig. 13 appear consistent
with those presented by US researchers (see Bolinger and Wiser,
2011).
In this context, and given the net cost to society of
amending the LRET policy, it would appear prudent to maintain
existing policy commitments.

8. Conclusion

This article has found that ongoing uncertainty in relation to
the future of large-scale renewable energy policy in Australia is
preventing the LGC market from operating efﬁciently. Our survey
of market participants conﬁrms that buyers and sellers of LGCs are
concerned about the potential for further legislative change and
this concern is manifesting itself in poor pricing and capital
allocation decision making. Arbitrage opportunities clearly exist
but no party is willing to clear the arbitrage based on battle-
hardened historical experience. Based upon the modelling pre-
sented in this article, our conclusion is clear – material amend-
ments to the LRET would result in net costs to consumers of
between $51 million and $119 million (2012$). Based upon this
conclusion, our recommendation is that the LRET should remain in
place and without amendment if conﬁdence in the policy is to be
restored. It is important to note that bipartisan support for the
policy continues as indicated by recent statements by political

15 The issue here is that, at the time of writing, Australia's terms of trade had
been falling while the Australian dollar had concurrently remained unusually
strong.

leaders such as, ‘There's a review coming but we remain committed
to the Renewable Energy Target’ (Hunt, 2012).16

Importantly, many of the conclusions made as a result of our
survey of market participants appear consistent with previous and
similar studies.
In our view, ROAM Consulting expressed the
requirement for consistency as well as any:

“a good outcome from the biennial review would be to leave the
LRET to function in its current form. Uncertainty about the future
of the scheme is a signiﬁcant issue, and there was consensus that
investor conﬁdence will return only if the legislation goes through
the review with no changes. Furthermore, the review should be
done as quickly as possible and released as quickly as possible
once complete.” (ROAM Consulting, 2012, p. 56).

Target

The Australian Government has set an ambitious target that at least 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity
needs will be met by Renewable Energy (RE) sources by 2020. Given the limited use of RE sources for
electricity generation, this national Renewable Energy Target (RET) leaves state, territory and municipal
governments in a challenging policy position. In this article, we examine the Australian state of
Queensland where RE provides approximately 4 per cent of the region’s electricity supplies. The research
utilizes stakeholder theory to examine the developmental barriers, targets, policies and actions identiﬁed
by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations in the RE industry sector. The results from our analysis show that
RE developments face a range of socio-technical barriers that require timely actions in the areas of
ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure enhancement, regulation reform, community-centred developments,
technology and workforce investments, and information and education programs. Also, in the context of
RE planning, while the national RET is the preferred setting, the differences between Queensland’s RE
installed generation capacity and electricity supply targets require clariﬁcation and agreement.

1. Introduction

In 2009, the Australian government legislated a Renewable
Energy Target (RET) of 20 per cent by 2020 (i.e. approximately
45,000 GWh of RE sourced electricity) in-line with its national plan
for a clean energy future [1,2]. While the plan is aimed at directly
mitigating the impacts of climate change, the ﬂow down of this
target and the development of Renewable Energy (RE) supply at the
state, territory and municipal
levels of government presents
a signiﬁcant challenge [3,4]. Accordingly, the impositions of a poor
RE development framework for RE asset construction and deploy-
ment may render the national RET unachievable in the remaining
timeframe.

Important in the context of our study, the policy opportunities
that have been canvassed by various researchers and RE advocates
provide a series of policy prescriptions and actions that support the
achievement of the RET and any state-level targets [5]. These
initiatives can take various forms, including RE Portfolio Standards
(RPS), government tendering of RE projects, tax beneﬁts for RE

assets purchase and depreciation, and voluntary green power
markets. However,
the selection of RET enabling actions,
commencement of the Australian carbon pricing legislation in mid
2012, and the relatively short 10-year timeframe for meeting the
national RET, presents some immediate challenges for domestic
governments [2,6].

In this investigation, the views of ﬁrms and stakeholder orga-
nizations confronted with RE policies and governmental actions in
the Australian state of Queensland are the primary subject of our
analysis. In sum, we seek to answer three major research questions.
First, what are the barriers and impediments to increasing RE in
national regions and states? Some studies show that RE solutions
often face difﬁcult technical, institutional and economic problems
and impediments (e.g. poor ﬁnancing arrangements, high technical
risks, unhelpful regulation,
In
a pragmatic sense, understanding the various contextual impedi-
ments faced by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations would be
instructive for researchers and industry practitioners. Second,
should state or regional governments establish targets for RE
supply? For example, while some countries apply targets to speciﬁc
RE sources (e.g. wind, solar, biomass) [11e14], Australia allows its
states and regions to establish their own renewable energy plans,
policies and targets (e.g. the New South Wales (NSW) state
government has adopted the national RET as its target [4]. In
tracking its progress, a recent independent audit of NSW electricity

faulty market systems) [7e9].

supply showed that 6.8 per cent of that state’s electricity supply is
currently being met by RE sources, while electricity prices have
risen by 6 per cent due to generators’ RET commitments) [15].
However, other studies show that striving to meet an RET might
result in the creation of multiple policy and regulatory instruments
[12] while also delivering less positive outcomes,
including
increased unemployment and reduced energy security [14]. Given
this background, it is important to understand the beneﬁts and
problems associated with setting state-level RETs. Finally, what
actions should states and regions take in order to meet national
level RETs? Our extant RE literature argues successfully that various
government policies and actions can aid the growth of RE supplies
in regions and countries [16,17]. However, in our case we are
speciﬁcally examining the views and recommendations of ﬁrms
and stakeholder organizations that have an exposure to the
development of RE sourced electricity in the state of Queensland.
Hence, the summation of responses to these questions enables
understanding of the context, appropriateness of state-level RETs,
and policies and actions that support RE supply expansion.

The balance of our paper is developed as follows. In the next
section we will discuss and contrast some of the critical RE litera-
ture and theory related to our study, including a detailed expla-
nation of the research setting. Next, the study will describe our
structured research method, including the data collection and
analysis procedures, followed by a presentation of the results and
their discussion. Our concluding statements highlight the impor-
tance of understanding what barriers and actions ﬁrms and
stakeholder organizations consider to be important for the growth
of RE supply, while noting the research limitations.

2. Building renewable energy supply e Barriers, targets,
policies and actions

The literature explicating the barriers to RE growth provides an
array of socio-technical problems and hurdles that confront ﬁrms
and industries [7e9,18]. In some instances, the problems can take
a strong behavioural form, such as the lack of awareness or infor-
mation to make sound judgments and decisions within the ﬁrm
[18], while in other circumstances the impediments might be based
on poor policy, administrative process or regulatory systems design
that deny generators adequate business opportunities [8,9,19].
Other barriers to the advancement of RE supply can take the form of
unhelpful and poorly designed energy markets [19,20]; sub-
optimal research and development, heightened technical risks,
and limited innovation and knowledge creation in the ﬁeld of RE
systems [8,18,21,22]; and, inadequate RE investment incentives and
project ﬁnancing arrangements [5,11,23,24]. In a collective sense,
despite the substantial number of identiﬁed impediments across
the RE literature, disciplinary experts are conﬁdent that these
barriers may ﬁnd some level of resolution with the delivery of
suitable policies and actions [12,14,16,17]. In this study, the barriers
identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations should allow us
to understand the larger RE business context and operational
impediments to meeting the national RET.

Foundation studies show that RETs form part of the larger set of
RE issues [21]. In particular, the literature shows that RE schemes
can take a quantitative position (e.g. RETs, quota systems for green
certiﬁcate trading, bidding and auction systems for carbon credits)
or a more price directed stance (e.g. Feed-in Tariffs (FiT), carbon
it is considered quite
pricing mechanisms) [25]. Accordingly,
appropriate that RETs, and possibly targets at the state, regional and
municipal
form part of a successful RE development
framework [4,26,27]. The more global views of RETs, shows us that
possibly 10e50 per cent of our primary energy needs will be met
through RE sources by 2050 [27]. Speciﬁc to this study, an overview

levels,

of global RETs shows a range of RE sourced electricity generation
targets from 20 to 35 per cent by 2020, stretching out to increas-
ingly more optimistic targets and outcomes of 50e80 per cent by
2050 [27]. We also noted that these types of aspirational RETs can
sometimes be set at less challenging (more easily achievable) levels
in smaller countries (e.g. 3 per cent) [28], while also requiring the
application of a strict deﬁnition to assure target efﬁcacy (e.g. share
of RE sourced electricity generation is based on actual supply or
production not installed capacity) [10,25]. However, despite some
of the intricacies in setting RETs, we would argue that under-
standing the types of state-level targets that might be established,
and the utility of these targets for ﬁrms and stakeholder organi-
zations, will assist and inform the development of effective policies
and actions.

Government policies and actions represent the engine room for
RE supply development [16,17]. Some of our earlier studies in RE
technology show us that appropriate policies can act as the glue
that supports positive linkages and actions between institutions
and actors in communities [21,29]. Indeed, some researchers depict
the relationship between policy and actions as simply: “if we
establish a speciﬁc RE policy goal, then we need distinct programs and
technologies to accomplish this” [21,29]. Several other studies point
to the requirement for effective policies that offer government
assistance packages (where required), investment and ﬁnancial
incentives arrangements, workable policies for RE FiT, cooperative
working systems for private and public organizations, industry
development and equipment manufacturing assistance, and stim-
ulants
innovation and design
systems
[5,8,22e24,30]. Importantly, these types of policy levers can serve
as high level frameworks for actions and activities that support the
growth and advancement of RE assets, infrastructure, supply and
equipment manufacturing [7,13,23,24,26,31]. In this study, we are
seeking to explore and expose the types of policies and actions,
identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations, which may
enable the state of Queensland to meet its obligation under the
national RET.

3. Renewable energy supply in Queensland e An overview

Earlier studies that focused on RE generation in Australia
depicted a slow and cautious start for the country [32]. The original
2001 national RET was modest seeking only a nominal 2 per cent of
RE supply by 2010, thereby equating to 9500 GWh of electricity
from renewable sources [32]. Also, other studies suggested that
Australian RE supply developments could beneﬁt from repricing
electricity and taking account of carbon-based pollution and other
environmental impacts from its dominant coal ﬁred power gener-
ators [33]. Arguably, these types of electricity price adjustments
could potentially stimulate further interest and investment in RE
projects across Australia.

The most recent studies from researchers, and the Australian
government, show RE sourced electricity generation in Australia
totalling approximately 7 per cent, with abundant fossil fuels still
serving as the primary energy source for the country [34,35]. In
addition, the latest energy supply trends show that Queensland
ranks third in overall RE installed generation capacity behind NSW
and Victoria. Accordingly, in order to meet the national RET, each
state and territory must play an active role in developing RE
supplies.

Queensland is Australia’s second largest state covering over 1.9
million square kilometres of land and home to over 4.5 million
citizens [36]. The state economy is based on strong mineral
resources (mainly coal, bauxite and copper) and tourism sectors,
with primary industry production of beef, bananas, sugar cane,
pineapples, peanuts, grains, cotton and wool. The state economy is

N.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127

121

founded on competitively priced electricity inputs that are
primarily supplied by various coal ﬁred power stations built during
the 1980e2000 period [37]. However, this results in Queensland
having the highest per capita carbon emissions of all the Australian
states and territories [37].

Queensland is also one of six interconnected regions that supply
approximately A$11 billion worth of electricity under a National
Electricity Market (NEM) that was created in 1998 [38]. The
Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) uses a centrally
controlled dispatch process to schedule and match electricity
producer outputs and consumer usage in a spot price market,
where Australian electricity laws and rules provide the operational
framework. NEM regulation is provided by the Australian Energy
Market Commission (managing the rule making process and
assessing proposed rule changes) and the Australian Energy
Regulator (monitoring and enforcement of rules and law compli-
ance). Importantly, the AEMO has stated that the current RET
will lead to changes in the mix of electricity supply sources and
location origins in the coming years, including RE supply from
Queensland [39].

In response to the national RET, the Queensland government
established the Ofﬁce of Clean Energy (OCE) in early 2009 to
administer the Queensland Renewable Energy Plan (QREP) [40].
The QREP applies to smallemedium and large scale RE develop-
ments (for the retail distribution and high voltage service provider
networks, respectively) and provides the high level framework for
the state to achieve its share of the national RET, estimated at
2500 MW installed capacity or 9000 GWh of electricity supply [40].
In executing the QREP, the Queensland government has moved
forward with several initiatives and projects as follows.

3.1. Biomass

Sugar cane waste (or bagasse) provides approximately 70 per
cent of the state’s RE supplies. The state government provided A$9
million, from its A$50 million Queensland Renewable Energy Fund
(QREF), for the development of Mackay Sugar’s energy cogenera-
tion plant at the Racecourse Mill near Mackay, North Queensland.
In addition to serving the current energy needs of the mill (65 MW),
the replacement plant will deliver an extra 27 MW of capacity to
the state electricity grid commencing in 2013.

3.2. Solar (hot water and photovoltaic)

The high levels of solar resources in Queensland (known as the
‘Sunshine State’) provide signiﬁcant opportunities for solar power
generation and deployment. The Queensland Solar Bonus Scheme
has seen over 30,000 customers install roof top photovoltaic (PV)
systems (with a 44 cents per kWh residential gross FiT applied), and
over 100 MW installed capacity during 2008e2010. The state
government supplemented this with the Queensland Solar Homes
Program where a bulk purchase of solar panels allowed 1000
homes to be ﬁtted with PV systems.

A state solar initiatives package valued at A$115 million is being
used to fund projects such as Virtual Solar Power Stations
(500 MW) in towns and communities (using PV and solar hot water
systems); the A$60 million Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme
(A$600e1000 per solar hot water installations); the A$5.8 million
PV system installation program for 420 kindergartens; the A$9.9
million Solar Sport and Communities initiative to support solar
systems installations in sports clubs and community organizations;
and, the A$35.4 million for the Kogan Creek Solar Thermal systems
installation.

In addition, the state government has also invested A$60 million
in the Solar and Energy Efﬁciency in State Schools program that will

see over 1250 schools ﬁtted with PV systems, and provided another
A$4 million for the Wide Bay Community solar farm to power
health services facilities in the Hervey Bay region. The state has also
provided A$5 million for Townsville’s participation in the federal
Solar Cities Program, while A$6.6 million has been allocated from
the QREF for solar roof top arrays at the Carrara Gold Coast stadium
and the University of Queensland campus, and a solar atlas (radi-
ation recording) project in western Queensland.

At the national level, in June 2011 the Solar Dawn Consortium
was awarded a federal Solar Flagships program grant to build
a 250 MW solar thermal and gas hybrid plant (85 per cent or
212 MW of renewable energy capacity) near Chinchilla in western
Queensland to commence operations in 2015 [41].

3.3. Hydro

The state operates

three small hydroelectricity stations
(167 MW) at Barron Gorge, Koombooloomba and Kareeya in North
Queensland. The Queensland government is currently engaged in
a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Papua New Guinea (PNG)
government, PNG Energy Developments Limited and Origin Energy,
to facilitate development of a large hydroelectricity project on the
Purari River in PNG. Electricity will be supplied to the NEM through
subsea transmission lines that connect
to Townsville, North
Queensland.

3.4. Wind

The Windy Hill wind farm in north Queensland has 12 MW of
installed capacity. AGL Limited has bought the development rights
to the Coopers Gap wind farm site which has an estimated 500 MW
generation capacity. The OCE has also published a wind map iden-
tifying which areas might be suitable for energy generation projects.

3.5. Geothermal

The state has provided A$15 million for the Queensland
Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence. The centre is a research
and development hub that will examine opportunities to generate
geothermal energy using new turbine, cooling tower and heat
exchanger designs; power transmission and network modelling;
and reservoir exploration and management.
In addition, A$5
million from the QREF has been allocated to investigate and identify
suitable hot rock formations in close proximity to existing high
voltage transmission networks.

3.6. Wave and tidal

The state has provided two small research and development
grants to a total of A$0.28 million to assist in building concept
demonstrators for a ﬂoating wave power generator and a tidal
turbine system.

Importantly, these QREP activities have seen the RE sourced
electricity generation capacities of Queensland grow by 29 per cent
over 2008e2010. Table 1 shows a comparison of the installed RE
capacity for the period 2008e2010 and the 2020 target. While this
growth in installed capacity has merit, the supply of electricity from
RE sources is still well below the 20 per cent target. The state
government advised that in 2010, the total electricity generation
capacity in Queensland was 14,500 MW with coal and gas ﬁred
power stations accounting for 87 per cent of the capacity. While
Queensland’s RE sourced electricity generation capacity was
approximately 7 per cent of total state capacity, only 4 per cent of the
state’s actual electricity supply was provided by renewable sources

due to the lack of renewable resources availability [42]. Hence, as
we noted from earlier studies, the difference between installed
generation capacity and actual electricity supply targets will need
clariﬁcation and agreement in the context of the QREP [10,25].

However, this is not the only problem facing the Queensland
government. The success of the QREP, and meeting the state’s
obligation under the national RET, is predicated on securing A$3.5
billion of the A$12 billion RE investments target set by the federal
[1,2]. Hence, under the current global ﬁnancial
government
conditions, ﬁnding over A$3 billion worth of investments for state
RE projects may not be easy in the immediate to medium term [43].
Given this context, understanding some of the practical barriers to
the
RE developments; how state-level RETs might support
achievement of the legislated national RET; and, what actions and
policies might prove effective in delivering higher levels of RE
supply would appear instructive and important. We would also
argue that looking at these issues through the lens of ﬁrms and
stakeholder organizations involved in the RE industry should create
a block of highly pragmatic and applicative knowledge.

4. Methodology

4.1. Data sources and collection

The data was collected on 30 October 2011 from the Queensland
government web pages that were established for the inquiry into
‘Growing Queensland’s Renewable Energy Electricity Sector’, con-
ducted by the state’s Environment and Resources Committee [44].
The committee was tasked to examine and report on ‘the oppor-
tunities and challenges for the Queensland Government associated
with increasing the proportion of electricity generated from renewable
energy sources in Queensland’ [44]. Importantly, the scope of this
inquiry provided the ﬁrm and stakeholder organization data for our
study (i.e. responses on RE development barriers, state-level RETs,
and policies and actions that support RE expansion). Data in the
form of written submissions from executives and managers in ﬁrms
and stakeholder government and non-government organizations
(GOs and NGOs) were collected and catalogued. A summary of the
44 ﬁrms and organizations is presented in Table 2.

4.2. Research technique and analysis

A qualitative research method has been used for this study in
order to collect, structure, and analyse the written submissions
from ﬁrms, GOs and NGOs [45,46]. The study is consistent with
other stakeholder inquiries where written statements related to
a primary issue of concern are individually and collectively ana-
lysed [47e49]. The study’s data structure has been created to
accurately trace ﬁrm and stakeholder organization responses to
questions associated with barriers to RE supply expansion, state-
level RETs, and policies and actions for RE developments, under the
precise scope of the government inquiry [44,50].

In order to structure, analyse and manage our data, we created
a research database using MS Access software [50]. The written
content was extracted and allocated to one of three speciﬁc data-
base structures (i.e. barriers, state-level RETs, and policies and
actions) to maintain data traceability and assure analytical integrity
[45,46,50]. A total of 335 statements were analysed and categorized
(e.g. ﬁnancial,
infrastructure, technical, regulatory) during the
course of the study. Following this procedure, the results from each
data structure was summarised and the highest ranked categories
presented in the discussion of results.

5. Results and discussion

5.1. Barriers to regional renewable energy supply growth

Firms and stakeholder organizations identiﬁed a range of
ﬁnancial,
regulatory, economic, and
information barriers to RE supply growth in Queensland. A
summary of the RE supply barriers are presented in Table 3.

infrastructure,

technical,

The six categories of barriers cover 87 per cent of all responses
and are consistent with much of the RE literature [18,51]. A group of
ﬁnance-related issues provided the most prominent barrier to the
growth of RE supply in Queensland. Firms and stakeholders stated
that the high capital costs associated with large scale RE projects in
remote regions dampened potential investments (e.g. the federal
solar ﬂagships program round one winning projects will build
a 250 MW solar thermal gas hybrid power plant in western
Queensland, and a 150 MW solar farm in western New South Wales,
at a cost of more than A$2 billion) [41]. Also, the lack of suitable
longer term ﬁnancial
incentives in the form of state-level
commercial FiT, government and taxation subsidies, favourable RE
(green) certiﬁcate pricing levels, and RE systems purchase rebate
schemes were also highlighted as major impediments to increased
RE sourced electricity supply. Our investigations also show that the
current contracting ﬁscal climate in Australia [52], and the inability
to negotiate proﬁtable long-term (25e30 year) Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs) with government businesses and private power
companies are acting as barriers to RE developments [53].

The second major set of barriers is concentrated on the avail-
ability of suitably robust and proximately located infrastructure. In
relation to large scale RE developments,
federal government
studies show that much of the state network is established in
a narrow corridor running along the eastern seaboard of the state,
and well away from the rich solar and wind resources in far west
and far northern Queensland [35]. Also, a public admission by the
state government’s Energy Minister that the retail electricity
network possesses insufﬁcient capacity to cope with new small and
medium scale solar power installations reinforces the views pre-
sented by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations [54]. It should be
noted that these infrastructure barriers also come with signiﬁcant
ﬁnancial expenditure, given the substantial costs associated with
the high voltage and retail electricity networks’ upgrades.

The technical barriers identiﬁed by the ﬁrms and stakeholders
provide a signiﬁcant challenge. First, while energy storage and
relocation devices, such as hydrogen cells, combined heat and
power, compressed air, pumped hydro, new and old battery, super
capacitor, and superconductor systems, continue along their
development pathways [55,56]; much of the state’s remotely
located RE sources requires technical storage and relocation
mechanisms to support their operation and control intermittency
of power delivery to the grid. Pivotally, the state government has
admitted that the emerging development of storage and control
technologies will assist with delivering RE developments in the
future [40]. Second, the ability to maintain a competent technical
workforce and skills base is difﬁcult under the current economic
conditions. The current sustained mining and resources boom in
Australia is a positive drain on skilled technical workers and
undermines the development of a stable RE industry workforce
[52]. In sum, these technical issues pose a serious challenge to
enlarged RE supply in the immediate to medium term.

Firms and stakeholder organizations assert that the regulatory
hurdles to enhanced RE supply provide an administrative and legal
impost to future developments. As an example, a review of the state
RE project development process highlights three major electricity
levels) gateways; three levels of
industry (state and national
government planning and approvals legislation, including a six part
project development assessment system; separate water and vege-
tation, environmental, and indigenous culture and heritage testing
protocols; and land leasing and/or acquisition procedures [57].
Accordingly, the framework for RE regulation established by the state
and municipal governments provides an extensive and time inten-
sive set of complex business processes for new RE supply projects.

As we noted earlier, the abundance of black coal resources for
energy generation in Queensland is the backbone of relatively
cheap electricity as a fundamental input to a vibrant state economy
[36,37]. In-line with earlier studies, responses suggest that the
absence of pricing carbon pollution into electricity is seen as
a barrier to the delivery of capital intensive RE projects [33]. In
addition, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations also argued that the
lack of RE information services and targeted education and

124

awareness programs for businesses and consumers continues to
hinder expanded RE supply.

Table 4
Building RE supply in Queensland.

5.2. The issue of state-level RETs

Over 57 per cent of ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations who
commented on the issue of state-level RETs argued that the
Queensland government should maintain its current QREP target,
and remain wholly consistent with the national RET [2,40]. The
principal argument for maintaining this target was to ensure that
the lowest cost solutions (projects) for RE supply were obtained
over the immediate and longer term (i.e. no distorted, higher cost
RE project approvals in order to meet regional or location based
targets). As an example, power ﬁrm Origin Energy typiﬁed this
position in their inquiry submission:

“Origin does not recommend that the Queensland Government set
a state speciﬁc obligation target around renewables. The main
reason for this position is that there should be no distortion of the
national RET. The building of the renewable generation ﬂeet should
not be artiﬁcially forced into speciﬁc geographical locations (or
speciﬁc technologies) by the introduction of a Queensland target, as
it will increase costs to customers” (Origin Energy, 30 June 2010).

Importantly, the majority of ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
asserted that all RE supply projects should be based on an
economically sound and responsible business case.

In other minority views, approximately 13 per cent of responses
suggested that the state government should support community
development through the application of regional based RETs (e.g.
20 per cent RE supply for seaboard (current grid) communities, and
50 per cent renewable energy supply for remote communities, by
2020); while another 13 per cent argued that improved sustain-
ability outcomes required more challenging state-level RETs
ranging from 23 to 40 per cent RE supply for Queensland by 2020.
In these cases, ﬁrms and organizations argued that RETs and
projects should be largely focused on regional and sustainable
development in Queensland.

5.3. Building renewable energy supply e Regional policies and
actions

Firms and stakeholder organizations identiﬁed seven major
areas of activity that might increase RE supply in Queensland. A
summary of the policies and actions, covering 88 per cent of all
responses, are presented in Table 4.

RE ﬁnance activities and actions attracted the highest level of
attention from ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations. In particular,
ﬁnancial incentives in the form of a large commercial scale gross FiT
and suitable tax breaks (e.g. accelerated asset depreciation, goods
and services tax rebates) to support large to medium RE asset
investments, were seen as attractive mechanisms for increasing the
number of RE supply projects and initiatives. Robust FiT structures
have been identiﬁed as important ﬁnancial
incentives for RE
investments [58]. As an example, solar PV and hot water ﬁrm The
Solar Guys argued for the implementation of a large commercial
scale gross solar FiT:

“Intelligent, long-term incentive mechanisms like feed-in tariffs
have been poorly implemented. A case in point is the Queensland
Solar Bonus Scheme e an instantaneous net solar feed-in tariff
scheme. A problem with the Queensland Solar Bonus Scheme is that
it doesn’t allow large consumers of power to participate and is
effectively limited to residential and light commercial customers.
Queensland government actions - establish a commercial and
industrial gross solar feed-in tariff” (The Solar Guys, 28 June 2010).

One of the difﬁculties facing the Queensland government,
should it seek to act on the issue of taxation, is that the federal
government’s Australian Taxation Ofﬁce retains overall responsi-
bility for business taxation law drafting and implementation [59].
Accordingly, this type of ﬁnancial incentive would require cross-
jurisdictional legal consultations and approvals [4]. Also, while
the state government is providing over A$200 million in grants and
funding for various RE supply projects, responses suggest that this
level of commitment needs to be increased in order to meet the
desired QREP outcomes. As noted earlier, the high costs associated
with RE projects in remote parts of Queensland would dictate this
as a prudent action [35].

As a further measure, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
asserted that the state government should take a more active role
in facilitating PPAs for RE developments. In the current process, the
Queensland government does not involve itself in any commercial
bargaining or negotiations between the state-owned electricity
generation (e.g. CS Energy, Stanwell Corporation) and retail (e.g.
Energex, Ergon Energy) companies and prospective RE developers
[57]. In essence, as in other studies, state government involvement
with PPA negotiations may smooth and increase the velocity of the
development process [60].

While high voltage network enhancements and remote grid
connections were identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
as important actions for RE supply, current and future planning
shows that Powerlink, the Queensland government-owned, high
voltage electricity transmission network service provider, has
allocated approximately A$250 million for eleven electricity
network replacement
(substation and transformer
renewals on the 275 kV backbone and smaller 132 kV links) over
2013e2017 [61]. In addition, two of sixteen proposed network
connections for the period 2013e2017 will service RE generation
plants in more remote locations (a proposed far northern
Queensland wind farm and the Solar Dawn 250 MW solar and gas
hybrid plant in western Queensland) [61]. We also found that in the

actions

125

retail electricity network, Energex and Ergon Energy are spending
A$15.6 billion over 2010e2015 to reinforce and increase the
capacity of the local distribution networks [62,63]. While recent
studies have highlighted the importance of grid reinforcement and
connections to RE supply, we acknowledge that future network
reinforcement, connections and capacity enhancements will be
dependent on the location of generation plants, and the economic
viability of the proposed network upgrade [64].

The suggestion by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations to
review and reform the RE planning and approvals process has
signiﬁcant merit. In a typical response, infrastructure developer
Transﬁeld Holdings made this point in their submission:

“Transﬁeld agrees with the broad selection of actions the Queens-
land Government could take to encourage investment in the
generation and cogeneration of electricity from renewable energy
sources. We would encourage the Committee to implement regu-
latory reforms to cut red tape for renewable energy projects
including the streamlining local government approval processes”
(Transﬁeld Holdings, 30 June 2010).

The difﬁculty facing prospective RE developers is that genera-
tion plants must comply with three different layers of planning
legislation [40]. As an example, renewable energy supply projects
must comply with the federal Environment Conservation and
Biodiversity Conservation Act
(1999), while also maintaining
compliance with the state’s Integrated Planning Act (1997), Envi-
ronmental Protection Act (1994) and Electricity Act (1994). Further
separate municipal council land-use regulations and approvals are
also applicable to RE projects. In response to these identiﬁed
impediments, the state government is moving to improve the
regulatory framework through its ‘Green Door’ initiative that uses
an integrated development assessment system to screen and
analyse the planning, ecological, economic and community well-
being aspects of the project, and fast track the development
through joint state and municipal council case management teams
[65]. In addition, the state has amended the Land Act (1994) to
allow lease holders to provide sub-lease access to RE supply ﬁrms
and developers [66]. As noted in other studies, these types of
regulatory process modiﬁcations are essential for the streamlining
and smoothing of RE supply projects and investments [67].

Developing clean energy communities using RE supply projects
was highlighted as a key action for the state government. Firms and
stakeholder organizations argue that the creation of RE districts and
zones, community ownership schemes, off-grid systems for remote
communities, and the fulﬁlment of community service obligations
using RE supplies are critical measures for growing the state’s RE
sourced electricity. In recent times, the state government has
identiﬁed some potential districts including southwest, central, far
west and far north regions of Queensland where community
development and services delivery could be progressed using RE
supply projects and initiatives (e.g. PV systems, solar hot water units,
small turbine wind energy systems) [68]. Importantly, in these cases
the integration of the RE supply sources with the community
provides local control and development autonomy beneﬁts that
may otherwise not exist, particularly in remote communities [69].
While the Queensland government has commenced funding
some research in the area of geothermal and wave/tidal energy
resources, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations suggest that more
funds need to be allocated to RE technology research and proof-of-
concept commercialization efforts. As an example, energy retailer
Energex argued that more state funding was required for RE tech-
nology research and commercial development:

“ENERGEX would like to see increased focus on the development of
cost effective energy storage devices. These devices would allow the

intermittent energy output from renewable generation to be stored
locally and then returned to the network when needed (at times of
peak demand). This technology would assist in reducing the need
for retail network upgrades” (Energex, 30 June 2010).

We support ﬁndings in other studies that show technology
research and commercial development funding is an identiﬁed
cornerstone of RE supply growth [8,21,23]. Speciﬁc to this study,
funding and supporting RE research and development, particularly
in areas of energy storage and relocation technologies, should
enable the state to keep a number of resource site and commercial
development options available in the longer term [40].

Growth in RE technical skills was also seen as a key driver of
enhanced RE supply. Accordingly, the QREP target of 3500 new RE
industry jobs by 2020 will require a repositioning of some state-
level employment and training,
jobs marketing, and tertiary
education programs in order to focus on critical RE skills develop-
ment [40]. While the target may be achievable in the longer term,
the high growth mining and resources sector will continue to
absorb large numbers of technically trained personnel
in the
immediate to medium term [52].

Firms and stakeholder organizations also considered that clear
long-term RE investment policies, including the pricing of carbon
into goods and services provision, would bring greater certainty to
the electricity market and support more RE developments (e.g. the
Queensland Youth Environment Council proposed a state-based
carbon tax policy to make renewable energy investments more
attractive) [44]. In late 2011, the Australian federal government
passed legislation to establish a price on carbon emissions, and
deliver transitional and investment assistance to the electricity
industry in order to close high pollution plants and stimulate
investment in clean energy generation [6]. These shifts in govern-
ment policy and legislation provide a framework that supports RE
supply growth and future developments.

Finally, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations considered the
information, education, knowledge and awareness
delivery of
programs to commercial businesses and individuals to be important
for RE supply growth. As an example, RE systems manufacturer
Conergy argued for improved community awareness and education:

“The Queensland Government needs to encourage investment in
renewable energy source electricity generation using a rounded
approach including community awareness and education to
promote the opportunities that the increased use of renewable
energy presents” (Conergy, 30 June 2010)

We note that information and awareness programs have long been
championed as a mechanism to grow RE supply chains [70]. However
in our study, responses suggested that the most efﬁcient way to
deliver these types of programs was to integrate them with existing
energy efﬁciency and savings programs at the state and federal level
(e.g. the Council of Australian Governments National Strategy on
Energy Efﬁciency) [71]. In sum, the combination of energy efﬁciency
and RE information should highlight the importance of using less
energy while having regard for green and RE resources.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have attempted to examine and identify the RE
supply growth barriers, targets, policies and actions that apply to
the state of Queensland in Australia. However, in pursuing this
research we must acknowledge some speciﬁc limitations of the
study and its method. First, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations
were openly invited by the state government to provide comments
and evidence for the inquiry. Accordingly, we had no control over
the selection of participating organizations or their responses to the

126

N.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127

inquiry. Second, the study is based on a single state of Australia that
is unique in terms of its population size and distribution, economy,
and energy assets. Accordingly, while some of the research results
may apply to other similar regions and countries, other results
might not be easily generalized. Notwithstanding these limitations,
this study has made a contribution to our improved understanding
of what RE development barriers exist and what actions we must
take to overcome them.

First, after nearly 14 years of studying the barriers to RE devel-
opment and supply we note that many ﬁnancial, infrastructure,
technical, regulatory, economic, and information and education
barriers still exist in one form or another [7,21,26,51]. Our analysis
of ﬁrm and stakeholder organization responses showed that in
Queensland, RE supply projects face impediments in the form of
high capital costs, insufﬁcient ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure
deﬁciencies, shortfalls in technology and technical workforce
capacity, and high levels of complex multi-tiered regulation. These
results suggest that RE developments still have some way to go in
terms of solving the socio-technical problems that confront this
industry sector.

Second, while the majority of ﬁrms and stakeholder organiza-
tions preferred states and territories to work within the national RET
framework, there may be some value in applying targets for regional
development and improved sustainability outcomes. The results
show that some ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations see value in
using RE resources as a development conduit in regional and remote
communities. Similarly, a further group of responses suggested that
setting a higher level state RET would enable improved carbon
pollution reduction and sustainability outcomes. In any case, further
precision needs to be applied to the QREP in terms of its RE targets
for installed generation capacity or electricity supply.

Third, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations have provided the
government with a broad range of actions and measures to grow
Queensland’s RE supply. While some regulatory reform and tech-
nology research and commercialization funding has been delivered,
there is still more work to be done in the areas of establishing long-
term ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure planning and realization,
regulatory harmonization across the three tiers of government,
community-centred developments, and information, education
and awareness programs. We would argue that these actions will
need to ﬂow effectively and consistently over the next nine years if
the QREP 2020 targets are to be met.

In closing, we note that Australia’s clean energy future legisla-
tion was passed into law on 8 November 2011 [6]. Hence, we see
further opportunities to study Australia’s RE industry sector,
particularly during the period following the introduction of the
carbon tax in mid-2012. We consider that the longer term exami-
nation and analysis of RE developments in Australia should create
several new and informative tranches of knowledge.

This paper provides a critical evaluation of Australia’s new Renewable Energy Target (RET) program
with respect to its capacity to support wind power development. Four structural ﬂaws associated with
the RET which undermine its effectiveness as a catalyst for technological change in the electricity sector
are discussed: (i) the inclusion of waste coal mine gas (WCMG) as an eligible fuel source which acts as
an indirect coal industry subsidy, (ii) program duration which is too short and ill-structured, (iii) a
multiplier that is well-intended to support small-scale renewable technologies but which creates
‘‘phantom capacity’’, and (iv) the capped target of 45,000 GWh which will stymie long-term wind
power market investment. The paper concludes with recommendations which stress the importance of
passing effective Carbon Pollution Renewable Scheme (CPRS) legislation to offset the weaknesses
associated with the RET. If an effective CPRS cannot be implemented, the paper recommends that
amendments be made to the RET to (i) remove WCMG from the list of approved alternative energy
sources, and (ii) extend the RET targets to reach 120,000 GWh by 2030.

Introduction

December 3, 2007 was a watershed day for Australian politics;
a new government was sworn into power under the Labor Prime
Minister, Kevin Rudd. One of the regime’s ﬁrst acts was to ratify
the Kyoto Protocol, and in doing so, committed Australia to
meeting a greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement target amounting to
8% above 1990 levels for the period 2008–2012. Although
Australia will likely meet this liberal target for the ﬁrst Kyoto
Protocol emissions reduction period thanks to favourable changes
in land-use and forestry, any subsequent reductions will require
radical structural changes to how the nation uses energy, which
even the government realises is of a magnitude that few other
industrialised nations face (Government of Australia, 2009h).
Given that nearly 50% of the GHG emitted in Australia comes from
power generation (Government of Australia, 2008a), it should
come as no surprise that one of the ﬁrst policy initiatives directed
at mitigating GHG emissions was a fortiﬁed program to encourage
enhanced development of renewable energy capacity in the
electricity generation sector.

The ﬂagship program of these enhanced efforts is the Renew-
able Energy Target
(RET) which consolidates all state-level
Renewable Energy Target programs and legally requires
Australia’s electricity utilities to ensure that 45,000 GWh of

total electricity
electricity purchases (approximately 20% of
generated) will be from renewable energy technologies by 2020.
On the surface,
the new RET brings Australia’s renewable
energy development program in line with EU targets (Hindmarsh
and Matthews, 2008) and gives Australian renewable energy
development ﬁrms the requisite market window to establish
stronger market presence, thereby enhancing economies of scale
and the likelihood of
renewable-sourced
electricity.

reduced costs of

For wind power developers in particular, the RET potentially
represents an opportunity to establish a strategic beachhead in
Australia’s electricity sector by capturing the economies of scale
necessary to close the commercially corrosive cost gap that exists
between wind power and coal-ﬁred electricity. Actual cost
differentials are hard to pin down for electricity sources due to
technological, operational and regional factors which cause costs
to vary; and peer reviewed sources on this topic for Australia are
somewhat dated. However, as a general indicator of the current
cost disparity, data from the Australia Institute in 2006 estimated
that the cost range of coal-ﬁred power was A$31–40 per MWh
(megawatt hour) while the wind power cost range was A$60–80
per MWh (Macintosh and Downie, 2006). As of December 2009,
the cost of coal had increased by over 25% from December 2005
levels.1 Moreover, wind power generation costs, which improved

4–7 fold from 1981 to 2006 (Celik et al., 2007), are widely
expected to continue to improve (Wizelius, 2007; DONG Energy,
2008). Accordingly, it is possible to argue that the cost disparity
has narrowed in the three years since this report was released.
Moreover, a recent study by the Australian Academy of Techno-
logical Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) estimates economically
quantiﬁable externalities associated with coal range between
A$42 and A$52 per MWh while the cost of economically
quantiﬁable externalities associated with wind power amount
to only $1.5 per MWh (ATSE, 2009). Taking into account these
external cost disparities, the cost of wind power is actually much
closer to the cost of coal-ﬁred power than market prices indicate
and might in some cases be less expensive. As the RET commences
in 2010, wind power prospects are positive because wind power
has the advantage of being close to commercially competitive and
capable of immediate adoption (Kann, 2009).

Of other promising alternative energy technologies, engi-
neered geothermal, solar PV and solar thermal technologies hold
promise given Australia’s abundance of these resources; however,
these technologies are not yet commercially viable for wide-scale
application (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008). Geothermal hot
in terms of scale
rock technology possesses massive appeal
potential. Geoscience Australia contends that tapping just 1% of
the energy from hot rocks located within 5 km of the earth’s
surface would be enough to supply 26,000 times Australia’s
annual power consumption on a perpetual basis for 2.6 million
years (Clean Energy Council, 2009). However, it is still at an early
developmental stage with only one operational site as of 2009
(Government of Australia, 2009a). Overall, geothermal
is not
anticipated to contribute to Australia’s electricity supply until at
least 2015 and even then only at a marginal level due to cost
(Government of Australia, 2009b). Solar PV technology is still 3–4
times the cost of gas-ﬁred electricity (Gurney et al., 2007).
Consequently, despite signiﬁcant government support programs,
recent projections estimate solar PV growing at an annual rate of
only 15 MW (medium case) up to 2020 (CME, 2009). Utility scale
solar thermal technology is also at a developmental stage, albeit
closer to commercialization with a 10 MW demonstration plant
planned in Queensland for 2010 (Government of Australia,
2009a). As a stand-alone technology, large-scale solar thermal
remains an expensive proposition thereby limiting commercial
diffusion to subsidised programs such as the Solar Flagships
program which earmarks AU$1.6 billion over 6-years to support
construction and demonstration of
large-scale solar power
stations, with an ultimate target of 1000 MW (Government of
Australia, 2009c).

Other prominent alternative energy technologies face non-
commercial barriers that are equally as formidable. Waste to
energy biomass is currently cost effective but growth is limited by
the capacity of Australia’s sparse population to generate and more
effectively manage waste. Although on the surface, agricultural
biomass and combustible materials (i.e. wood and wood by-
products) appear promising thanks to surplus land to support
such initiatives, wide-scale adoption of these technologies is
impeded by environmental factors which include extreme water
impacts associated with wide-scale
shortages, environmental
harvesting of energy crops, seasonal harvests which produce a
feast–famine supply proﬁle and competing agricultural interests
(IEA, 2005; MacGill et al., 2006; Gerardi et al., 2007). Growth
potential for hydropower is limited by a dwindling number of
exploitable water sources and severe regulation of water utiliza-
tion (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008; Government of Australia,
2009b).

Meanwhile, research into carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS) technology to render fossil fuel technologies as alternative
‘‘clean’’ energy sources is still at the developmental stage (Gurney

et al., 2007). As of April 2009, no functional CCS and power plant
integration exists at an industrial scale anywhere in the world
(Government of Australia, 2009h). Furthermore, it was estimated
as recently as 2007 that utility-scale implementation of CCS
technology would increase generation costs by 38–44% for new
natural gas combined cycle plants and 44–65% for new pulverised
coal plants, thereby rendering both technologies competitively
uneconomical (Gurney et al., 2007).

Finally, despite indications of increasing pressure to revisit
existing nuclear policy, Australia is a nation in staunch opposition
to the development of nuclear power. Any policy changes in
support of nuclear power will likely face vociferous opposition.
Moreover, there is evidence that the cost of nuclear power in
Australia would exceed the cost of wind power and even if the
cost disparity were negligible, further evidence indicates that CO2
associated with the entire nuclear fuel cycle is comparative in
volume to emissions from gas-ﬁred power stations (Saddler et al.,
2007; Sovacool, 2008).

In summary, although all of the alternative energy technolo-
gies listed can and likely will have a role to play in Australia’s
transition away from carbon-intensive electricity generation,
wind power developers in Australia face an unprecedented
opportunity to snap up the majority of business generated by
the January 1, 2010 commencement of the RET, provided the RET
is structured in a way to support progressive wind power
development.

In order to effectively support progressive development of
wind power, two elements must be integrated into a policy
instrument. The ﬁrst element is that support policies must be
designed to simultaneously encourage utilities to make the
investments necessary to operationally support enhanced levels
of wind power. For example, in Japan, despite the existence of
government subsidies to encourage wind power development,
utilities purportedly place undue storage demands on wind
power developers due to concerns that the existing grid will be
destabilized due to the ﬂuctuating nature of wind power
(Englander, 2008). Although wind developers are keen to take
advantage of government inducements to sell wind power into
the existing system,
Japanese utilities are not making the
investments necessary to support a progressive presence of wind
power (Valentine, in press). The second element is that any
support policies must encourage wind power developers to
commit the investment necessary to render wind power com-
mercially competitive when the support policy is removed. For
example, in Taiwan, the feed-in tariffs provided to wind power
developers are viewed as insufﬁcient for encouraging in-land
wind farm development; and as a result, a situation is emerging
wherein wind power developers are exploiting only the most
ﬁnancially attractive sites in Taiwan before moving on to other
countries. Once all the ﬁnancially attractive sites have been
exploited, it is highly likely that wind power development in
Taiwan will stall (Valentine, 2010).

This study ﬁrst aims to evaluate Australia’s new RET on the
basis of these two elements in order to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
this new program to support progressive wind power develop-
ment. The analysis highlights a number of ﬂaws in the RET which
may signiﬁcantly undermine progressive development of wind
power; therefore, this paper also seeks to put forth recommenda-
tions on how to improve the RET.

The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a
proﬁle of
the Australian electricity industry and discusses
recent developments and trends in regard to wind power
development. Section 3 evaluates the new RET in the context of
supporting progressive wind power development. Section 4
provides some concluding thoughts on how to improve the
effectiveness of RET.

2. The Australian electricity industry and wind power
development

With the exception of the Northern Territory and Western
Australia, Australia boasts an integrated national energy market
(NEM) which was established in 1998 to enhance electricity grid
security and provide a more competitive market for the supply of
electricity (NEMMCO, 2005). The NEM which serves about 90% of
Australia’s population (MacGill et al., 2006) is a ‘‘compulsory gross
pool market’’ in which bids to sell electricity are collected en
masse and electricity dispatches are sequenced according to the
price (Owen, 2009). Australia is the only major economy to have
introduced and maintained this type of mandatory wholesale
electricity trading market (Chester, 2007).

Australia is blessed with massive stores of coal, laying claim to
24.1% of the world’s economic demonstrated reserves of brown
coal and 5.4% of the world’s economic demonstrated reserves of
black coal (ABARE, 2009). Consequently, it should come as no
surprise that coal plays a dominant role in the Australian
electricity generation industry. To get a feel for the signiﬁcance
in Australia’s electricity mix, Table 1 summarizes
of coal
In 2005–06,
electricity generation by fuel type in 2005–06.
brown and black coal accounted for 75.6% of Australia’s
electricity generation (ABARE, 2008).

One energy technology that is conspicuously absent from
Australia’s electricity generation mix is nuclear power. Although
national uranium reserves account for 40% of total economically
accessible uranium stocks (Wesley, 2007), Australia does not
produce any electricity through nuclear power. Although there is
considerable public opposition to the prospects of nuclear power
(Falk et al., 2006), there has been renewed political discussion
over nuclear power development as a possible solution to CO2
emission abatement (Schlapfer, 2009).

Table 1 also highlights how important it is for the Australian
government to facilitate a transition away from coal. Per capita
emissions of CO2 from fuel combustion in Australia are amongst
the highest in the world and 43% above the average for Inter-
national Energy Agency countries (IEA, 2005). Of the 576 Mt
(CO2 equivalent) of GHG that Australia emitted in 2006, 47% was
from electricity generation (Government of Australia, 2008a) and
the vast majority of that was from coal combustion (IEA, 2005).
Moreover, under ‘‘business as usual’’ practices, Australia’s green-
house gas emissions from electricity generation are expected to
increase by 37% between 2004 and 2050 (Gurney et al., 2007).
Clearly if the new Labor government is to achieve marked
progress in reducing domestic CO2 emissions, a radical realign-
ment of Australia’s electricity industry will be required. The
trouble is that the low price of coal in Australia along with the
apparent security that huge stores of this resource provides
portends a rocky road for a transition to renewable energy.

Wind energy, as the most commercially viable utility-scale
renewable technology, is expected to be the largest contributor to
Australia’s new RET targets (Government of Australia, 2009b).
Wind power is rapidly expanding in Australia thanks in large part
to former national and state-level
initiatives to encourage
enhanced uptake of renewable energy by Australia’s utilities.
According to the World Wind Energy Association, Australia
possessed 1494 MW of installed wind power capacity at the end
of 2008, which represents the 14th highest level of installed
capacity in the world. In 2008, Australia’s installed wind power
capacity grew by 83% which was the third-highest growth rate
in the world (WWEA, 2009). A study commissioned by the
Australian government in 2005 projected an increase in installed
wind power capacity in Australia of at least 7360 MW by 2029/30
(Akmal and Riwoe, 2005). This would represent a ﬁve-fold
increase over current levels. However, statistics pointing to the
success of wind power development in Australia can be mislead-
ing because when Australia’s total installed wind power capacity
is compared to the wind power potential which exists in the
country, it becomes evident that a signiﬁcant opportunity to abate
the national dependency on coal-ﬁred power generation is being
missed.

With the exception of Australia’s northern coast, coastal areas
throughout Australia boast average annual wind speeds in excess
of 8 m/s (at 10 m) and are considered to be excellent locations for
wind turbine placement (Coppin et al., 2003). Furthermore, there
are huge tracts of land in the southern portion of Western
Australia and throughout the states of Southern Australia and
Victoria with average annual wind speeds in excess of 7 m/s (at
10 m) which would constitute ‘‘good’’ wind conditions for wind
turbine sites (Coppin et al., 2003). Mark Diesendorf estimates that
long-term wind power potential in Australia may be as high as
20,000 MW (Diesendorf, 2003, 2007). Assuming a capacity factor
of 35%, harnessing this potential would generate 60,000 GWh of
electricity annually, which represents about 28% of Australia’s
projected supply of electricity in 2020.

Although the theoretical potential of wind power in Australia
is sufﬁcient to provide all of Australia’s current electricity
requirements, there are technical constraints that dampen the
prospects of a virtually carbon-free electricity system. The
stochastic nature of wind power makes it necessary at higher
levels of electricity grid integration for wind power to be
integrated with storage or back-up reserve in order to avoid
destabilizing electricity grid operational security (Ackerman,
2005). As Saddler and colleagues (2007) point out,
‘‘currently,
the limitation is not the wind resource, but rather the transmis-
sion infrastructure, which has evolved for large centralised power
stations’’. Nevertheless, the Australia Institute, drawing from
international experience with wind power
integration into
electricity grids, has estimated that spare capacity in Australia’s
existing electricity grid can accommodate up to 20% wind power
before the stochastic nature of wind power begins to pose a
technical threat to grid security (Macintosh and Downie, 2006).

It might be tempting for critics to argue that the Australia
Institute’s estimate may be overly optimistic given the dominant
role that coal plays in the national energy mix and the relatively
low levels of installed capacity in hydropower and gas-ﬁred
power plants which are essential technologies for responding
effectively to the type of load ﬂuctuations associated with wind
power. However, there is also a counter-argument to such
criticism that the addition of electricity storage technologies or
enhanced reserve peak-load generation capacity could enable the
integration of wind power levels that extend well-beyond the 20%
benchmark (Diesendorf, 2007). As a testament to the technolo-
gical feasibility of incorporating high levels of wind power with
enhanced back-up support, electricity grids in two towns in

ARTICLE IN PRESS

3671

Western Australia (Denham and Hopetoun)
incorporate as
much as 70% electricity from wind energy (supported by diesel
generation), with an average wind power contribution of approx-
imately 40%.

Enhancing reserve capacity comes at a cost. One study
estimates that the additional cost of backup generation (i.e. gas
ﬁred power plants) necessary to allow wind power to reach high
contribution levels (i.e. 40%) in Australia would increase the cost
of wind generated power by approximately 25% on top of existing
wind power generation costs (Diesendorf, 2003), constituting a
premium of only 1–2b per kilowatt hour. Aside from these
technical costs of supporting high levels of
installed wind
power capacity, there are grid connection costs that need to be
considered in order for Australia’s wind power potential to be
better exploited. In many cases, grid connections would need to
be extended into remote areas where the absence of competing
land uses enhances the commercial viability of wind farms. One
estimate of
the cost of new transmission and distribution
infrastructure is at least AU$50 per meter for laying the cabling
and AU$35 per meter for any necessary access roads (Wizelius,
2007). This can amount to a 10% or higher premium on wind
power project costs (Wizelius, 2007).

Although in aggregate the economic costs associated with
additional reserve capacity and grid connection signiﬁcantly
increase wind power generation costs at high levels of installed
capacity, there are also economic savings associated with CO2
reductions that offset these additional costs. Many of the external
costs referred to earlier (A$42–A$52 per MWh (ATSE, 2009))
represent real costs that the nation is currently incurring even if
the nation’s citizens have not yet been forced to pay for some of
the more insidious economic impacts that are ineluctably bound
to progressive global warming. Furthermore, the ATSE external
cost estimates fail to take into consideration environmental
impacts such as damage to ecological habitats that temperature
change will bring because the ATSE projection only considers
impacts that can be economically quantiﬁed.

Irrespective of the barriers to full exploitation of Australia’s
technical wind power potential, evidence presented to this point
in the paper suggests that achieving a target of 20% or greater
contribution from wind power is both technically feasible and less
economically damaging than critics contend. A study by the
Australia Institute estimates that adding approximately 5% of
wind power to the existing grid by 2010 would only cost
consumers AU$15–$25 per year extra (Macintosh and Downie,
2006). The study further points out that if the costs of pollution
fuel power generation were fully
associated with fossil
internalized, the additional costs (including generation cost
disparity) to the homeowner would be fully offset (Macintosh
and Downie, 2006). These conclusions are supported by the study
into the externalities associated with coal by Australian Academy
of Technological Sciences and Engineering, referred to earlier
(ATSE, 2009).

In terms of assessing the impact that a 20% or greater
electricity supply contribution from wind power would make to
CO2 abatement in Australia, the New South Wales government
estimates that each MWh of power produced by wind farms can
displace 0.929 tons of CO2 which would otherwise be generated
through coal-ﬁred generators (Macintosh and Downie, 2006).
Employing this metric, if wind were to supply the 45,000 GWh of
electricity which is projected to account for 20% of the electricity
supply in 2020, wind power would displace approximately 42
million tons of CO2, which represents a 16% reduction of 2006
national CO2 emissions attributed to electricity generation.

In symbiotic fashion,

three notable developments have
appeared in the policy sphere to indicate that a path is being
created for encouraging greater uptake of wind power in

Australia. First, over the past decade, Australia’s state-owned
electricity grids have been integrated to form a national grid (the
NEM). Now, all regions except for the state of Western Australia
and the Northern Territory have interconnected electricity grids
(Owen, 2009). For wind energy, grid inter-connectivity delivers a
number of notable beneﬁts. For example, an interconnected
electricity grid allows states to integrate higher levels of wind
power without the risk of stochastic ﬂows destabilizing the grid
(Ackerman, 2005). It also allows wind farms to be geographically
dispersed which further dampens the adverse effect of wind
intermittency (Coppin et al., 2003). Second, the market liberal-
ization initiatives that accompanied grid inter-connection have
signiﬁcantly improved the prospects for wind energy developers
to sell energy into the grid (Owen, 2009). Third, the RET artiﬁcially
enhances market prospects by mandating enhanced purchases of
electricity generated from renewable technologies. Given that a
bill for a new CO2 emission trading system – the CPRS (Carbon
Pollution Reduction scheme) – which the government sought to
implement in conjunction with the RET was defeated in Parlia-
ment, the RET is currently the centerpiece of the government
strategy to facilitate a transition to renewable energy. Accord-
ingly, assessing the pros and cons of this legislation warrants
further attention.

3. The efﬁcacy of the RET for supporting wind power
development

The Renewable Energy Target (RET) announced in August
2009 builds on the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET)
program of 2001 which aimed to encourage 9500 GWh of
electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2010
(Government of Australia, 2009e). This MRET target was pre-
maturely achieved in 2006 (Kann, 2009). As mentioned earlier,
the new RET aims to encourage 45,000 GWh of electricity
generation from renewable sources by 2020 and consolidates all
existing state and territory renewable energy schemes into a
single national scheme which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the planning
process for renewable energy developers (COAG, 2009). Moreover,
the 2009 amendment increases the penalty levied on electricity
retailers who fail to reach their 20% quota of renewable electricity
sales from A$40 to A$65 (Government of Australia, 2009f).
This penalty is not tax deductible (Gerardi et al., 2007); therefore,
the punitive value of this penalty to the ﬁrm is approximately
A$90 (Government of Australia, 2009g), which serves as a robust
incentive for electricity providers to meet their quotas. On the
surface, the RET appears to be a bold initiative that places
Australia’s climate change response efforts on equal footing as
that of the EU, both aiming to ensure that 20% of electricity
generated will be delivered via renewable energy technologies by
2020 (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008). However, there are four
speciﬁc features of the RET that indicate it may under-deliver
both in terms of meeting its intended goal of
facilitating
45,000 GWh of renewable energy generation and encouraging
enhanced commercial viability of wind power.

The ﬁrst feature of concern relates to the treatment of waste coal
mine gas. When the government was designing the RET program, it
did so under the assumption that the CPRS would also be legislated
and the RET would gradually be phased out. Under this assumption,
the government agreed to a political concession to allow waste coal
mine gas (WCMG) to be included in the RET as an ‘‘eligible energy
source’’ to differentiate it from the ‘‘renewable energy sources’’. The
concession allows WCMG-ﬁred power plants to apply to obtain
renewable energy credits (REC) for electricity generated using this
fuel source. The government capped the number of RECs available
to WCMG projects (at 425 GWh in 2011 and 850 GWh every year

3672

S. Valentine / Energy Policy 38 (2010) 3668–3675

ARTICLE IN PRESS

from 2012–2020) and increased the aggregate RET by these
amounts to avoid eroding the market for RECs attached to
renewable energy projects (Government of Australia, 2009d).
Unfortunately, there is a ﬂaw with this treatment of WCMG in
the absence of a CPRS. WCMG is a by-product of the coal mining
process. Accordingly, any wholesale price of captured WCMG that
is above the marginal cost of capture represents additional proﬁts
to coal mining ﬁrms. If WCMG were not included in the RET
mandatory purchase program, it is unlikely that there would be
much proﬁt in capture for sale of WCMG because the cost of capture
makes the technology commercially unattractive. However, in the
presence of a mandatory purchase program, WCMG can be
captured and sold at a proﬁt. In short, the policy as it now stands
is a form of subsidy to coal mining ﬁrms which if passed on through
the coal value chain will reduce the cost of coal and widen the
gap between the costs of coal-ﬁred power and wind power.
Any progress made during the course of the RET in closing the
economic divide between the costs of coal-ﬁred power and wind
power will potentially be usurped by proﬁts accruing to the coal
mining industry as a result of WCMG capture for sale. It also
incentivizes the commercialization of a technology that is far
from a clean energy source because methane combusted for
electricity generation produces CO2 emissions. This subsidy to
WCMG power facilities along with a proposed AU$270 million ‘‘Coal
Sector Adjustment Fund’’ which the government proposes
establishing within the Climate Change Action Fund to provide
funding for coal sector abatement projects and capital grants
(Government of Australia, 2009c), represents a level of ﬁnancial
assistance to a dirty energy source that should be taxed rather than
subsidised.

A second feature of concern related to the RET involves the
duration of the program. As it stands now, the program is
designed to expire in 2030 with annual targets ﬁxed in the
manner outlined in Table 2 (Government of Australia, 2009f). The
renewable energy targets increase steadily over the ﬁrst decade to
reﬂect a cumulative increase in installed capacity. To illustrate,
the annual target of 14,400 GWh in 2011 conceptually consists
of 12,500 GWh of pre-existing renewable energy generation
and 1900 GWh of new generation to be added in 2011. Accom-
modation is made for adding annual capacity up to 2020 when the
annual target of 45,000 GWh of total generation is slated to be
met. No additional capacity has been targeted beyond 2020
because the CPRS was expected to be enacted at the same time as
the RET and it was felt that emissions trading under the CPRS
would become robust enough to level the technological playing
ﬁeld and render the RET moot (COAG, 2008; Government of
Australia, 2008b). Unfortunately the CPRS Bill was defeated in
Parliament and this has signiﬁcantly weakened the efﬁcacy of the
RET as originally planned. As it now stands, in the ﬁnal 10 years
of the RET program, there will be diminished incentive for
electricity retailers to add additional renewable energy capacity
beyond that which was established in the ﬁrst ten-year period.
Barring any amendments to this target post-2020 or the imple-
mentation of other CO2 emission reduction policies, one can
expect a signiﬁcant drop-off in renewable energy growth once the
target of 45,000 GWh of generation is reached (cf. IEA, 2005).
An additional complication arising from the manner in which the
targets have been laid out over the 20-year period is that there

likely be heavy competition amongst renewable energy
will
developers in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of
the scheme because
establishing renewable technology capacity in the early years of
the program ensures that renewable energy developers will be
able to compete for 15–20 years of guaranteed purchases.
Long-term revenue earning capability is essential to renewable
energy developers who typically extend debt ﬁnancing and
amortize investments over 15-year periods (Gerardi et al., 2007;
Wizelius, 2007). Conversely,
renewable energy developers
bidding for the 4600 GWh of new electricity supply between
2019–2020 will only have 10 years of certain business prospects
before the program expires. Consequently, assuming there is no
emergent supplemental policy to regulate GHG emissions, one
can anticipate reduced competition for renewable energy sales in
the latter part of the program and; therefore, comparatively
higher renewable sales prices. In short, the current structure of
the RET works counter to the goal of encouraging an acceleration
of renewable energy demand to support the economies of scale
to facilitate further reductions in renewable energy prices.
It supports the process half way and then allows the market to
drop out.

A third feature of concern relates to a multiplier scheme
established to support small electricity generators. Essentially
under this mechanism, renewable electricity credits produced by
small-scale (rated output under 1500 KW) solar PV, solar thermal
(water), wind and hydro electricity systems will be multiplied by
a pre-established ’’multiplier’’ for electricity output as outlined in
Table 3 (Government of Australia, 2009f). Under this system,
10 MWh of electricity generated by an approved small-scale
technology will receive REC credit for 50 MWh of generation,
thereby reducing the RET pool by that inﬂated amount. In short,
the program creates phantom credits that exaggerate the real
amount of renewable electricity generated. Moreover, although
this will catalyze robust sales in early years for solar thermal
heaters and household-scale electricity generators, the added
competition from small generators might be signiﬁcant enough to
impair the development of utility-scale renewable electricity
projects during the 2010–2015 period, which is speciﬁcally when
wind power and other larger utility-scale developments need to
be initialized in order to provide 10–15-years of revenue to allow
developers to proﬁtably amortize investments.

Finally, as a fourth feature of concern, the strategic decision to
design a capped target system for renewable energy as opposed
to offering renewable energy developers a feed-in subsidy or
production tax credit
for unlimited amounts of electricity
generated is arguably a questionable strategy if the goal is to
nurture the emergence of a commercially viable domestic
renewable energy industry. For wind power developers to be
successful in any given market over a sustained period, two things
must exist. First, the wind power developers must be able to make

a proﬁt in order to support the type of investment (i.e. capital
investment, R&D initiatives, capacity expansion, etc.) that is
essential for reducing future costs and enhancing the long-term
commercial viability of wind power. Second, revenue ﬂows need
to be cumulative, the current year’s revenues building on past
years. This provides wind power developers with increasing
economies of scale which further help reduce costs and further
enhance the long-term commercial viability of wind power.
Under a capped target system, especially one with relatively mild
targets at the front-end such as that exhibited by the RET, neither
of these two criteria are likely to be met. First, wind power
developers will see proﬁts squeezed by heated competition in the
thermal water heaters
early years (with small-scale solar
complicating the competitive mix); and therefore, wind devel-
opers will have diminished capacity to ﬁnance capital expendi-
tures and other investments to stimulate cost reduction. Second,
the capped target system disrupts revenue ﬂow predictability and
undermines strategic planning. Under the RET, unless there is a
drastic change in market economies or additional policies to
support a transition to renewable energy, it is likely that market
demand for new renewable energy capacity will diminish in 2020.
This means that established wind power ﬁrms that have gained
momentum over 10 years of progressive revenue increases will
suddenly ﬁnd themselves mired in a contracting market with the
bulk of revenue being provided by an asset base is gradually aging
toward obsolescence.

4.

Improving the RET

Methods for improving the RET will differ depending on
whether or not an effective emission trading scheme (ETS) is
eventually enacted.

The four weaknesses of the current RET which were outlined
earlier could be offset by the beneﬁts a robust cap and trade
regime can provide. First, the ﬁnancial beneﬁts to the coal
industry that the waste coal mine gas (WCMG) subsidy provides
would be signiﬁcantly minimised if the WCMG project developers
had to purchase CO2 emission permits and still generate WCMG-
ﬁred power at competitive rates. Second, an ETS that effectively
taxes CO2 emissions would level the competitive playing ﬁeld
between coal-ﬁred power and wind power and enhance long-
term revenue prospects for wind power that extend beyond the
duration of
the small generator multiplier
intended to give a boost to small-scale technologies would be
less of a threat to wind power market development because the
business lost to small-scale generators in early years would be
compensated for through business taken away from carbon-
intensive power plants in ensuing years (once the multiplier
program expires) as the electricity industry evolves in response to
the positive market signals that an ETS would convey. Finally, the
cap of 45,000 GWh would no longer be an issue of concern
regarding progressive wind power market growth because once
the ETS begins to reﬂect international values for CO2 emissions
credits (as the Australian CPRS was intended to achieve), wind

the RET. Third,

Proposed renewable energy capacity targets post-2020.

power would become cost competitive and render the RET cap
moot. In summary, under a scenario which includes enactment of
an effective ETS, the RET as it now stands is sufﬁcient for
supporting wind power development.

Obviously, this presupposes that any ETS (such as the CPRS)
would set annual emission ceilings at a level that would signiﬁcantly
alter the comparative costs of electricity sources. A weak cap and
trade system would do little to level the competitive playing ﬁeld in
the manner necessary to provide wind developers with long-term
market growth prospects. Indications are that the proposed CPRS is
designed to be an aggressive program under which annual permits
would be restricted over time to achieve the national 60% GHG
reduction target (based on 2000 levels) by 2050 (Government of
Australia, 2008b). This implies a robust program where the value of
carbon credits would substantially increase the overall cost of fossil
fuel-based electricity and signiﬁcantly alter market dynamics.

In a ‘‘business as usual’’ scenario where an effective ETS is not
enacted, the RET is not currently sufﬁcient to improve commercial
viability of wind power. As such, all four of the weaknesses
identiﬁed earlier need to be amended.

First, if the goal is to wean the nation off a dependence on
coal-ﬁred electricity, the WCMG should not be eligible for RECs.
Any part of the coal value chain that is subsidised in this way
strengthens the economic case for continued reliance on coal-
ﬁred power and makes it harder for utility-scale alternative
electricity sources (such as wind power) to compete on a level
basis. Already, alternative energy technologies face an uphill
battle when competing against coal-ﬁred electricity providers due
to disproportional government support. For example, the coal
sector beneﬁts from two programs – COAL21 which is a 10-year,
AU$1 billion public–private partnership program to ﬁnance
research into reducing emissions from coal (Government of
Australia, 2009g) and the CCS Flagship program which is a
9-year AU$2.4 billion program to support carbon capture and
sequestration research (Government of Australia, 2009c) – while
the main renewable energy support program under the Clean
Energy Initiative provides just AU$465 million to be shared across
numerous renewable energy technology platforms. Although
other renewable energy support initiatives exist, they pale in
comparison to the R&D expenditures in the coal industry. If the
release of methane from coal mines is a concern, ﬂaring or capture
for energy use should be regulated, not subsidised.

Second, the government should consider formally extending
the RET program to facilitate a measured expansion of installed
renewable energy capacity from 2020 onwards in order to
encourage the scale of transformation necessary to meet the
government’s 2050 target of 60% GHG reduction (based on 2000
levels). Table 4 provides a quantiﬁed recommendation in this
context. If the targets outlined in Table 4 were adopted, renew-
able power developers would have a high degree of ﬁnancial
certainty past the 2020 period and would be incentivized to make
the investments necessary to aim for an entrenched market
position beyond 2040. Although it can be argued that such long-
term security can inadvertently encourage commercial apathy

electricity ensures
renewable energy
that even amongst
providers, a high degree of cost competition will ensue as ﬁrms
vie for long-term market share leadership. The ﬁnal target of
120,000 GWh recommended in Table 4 would represent
approximately 50% of Australia’s electricity supply and as such
the dynamics of load balancing would likely catalyze coordinated
initiatives to support the most commercially viable renewable
technology (wind power) through highly responsive technologies
such as geothermal power (the renewable technology that holds
the most potential for providing peak load supply) and natural
gas-ﬁred power. Not only would the extension of the RET
encourage the development of two technologies that are key to
a carbon-free electricity sector (wind power and geothermal
power), the achievement of the targets outlined in Table 4 would
place Australia ﬁrmly on track to achieving the 60% reduction on
GHG emissions levels (based on 2000 emission levels) by 2050
(Government of Australia, 2008b) and position Australia to
achieve the type of aggregate deep emission reductions (in the
range of 80% from 1990 levels) that each nation will have to
make to offset the worst impacts associated with global warming
(Stern, 2006; IPCC, 2007). Obviously, setting such bold wind
power targets would beneﬁt from advances in storage technology.
Therefore, the government should consider ramping up funding
support for storage technology research. This is arguably a more
sustainable use of the AU$2 billion in government funding that
has been earmarked for carbon capture and sequestration
research (Government of Australia, 2009c).

An additional beneﬁt of extending renewable energy generation
targets beyond the 2020 period is that the new targets would
mitigate the threat posed by the multiplier system for small-scale
generators and negate the fourth concern associated with the
current RET that a capped target system does not encourage long-
term market investment. Although, under the proposed target
extensions in Table 4 a cap is still in place, the cap comes into play
far enough into the future to provide the long-term purchase
guarantees (15 years +) necessary to entice wind power develop-
ments (after the incentivization of solar water heaters runs its
course) and provides more time to allow research in renewable
energy technology to yield the cost-saving innovations needed to
compete without market support.

In summary, the best approach for the government is to push for
the passage of the failed CPRS bill provided that the CPRS is robustly
structured to force electricity generators to internalise the external
costs of CO2 emissions – at least to a level that parallels notable
international carbon taxation efforts such as the ETS in the EU.
However, in lieu of an effective ETS, eliminating WCMG from the
RET list of eligible energy sources and extending the RET targets to a
2040 target of 120,000 GWh will enable wind power developers and
other renewable energy developers to achieve the scale of activity
necessary to support the type of radical transition that the nation
acknowledges is necessary in the face of the threats posed by global
warming (Government of Australia, 2009h).

At the end of the day, it comes down to the political will and
capacity of the new Labor government to ﬁght the battles
necessary to infuse the RET with the transformational impact it
was intended to exhibit. In the absence of such political will, like
so many other national governments in states where wind power
is underperforming, it ends up being the governing party in
Australia that is responsible for ‘‘braking wind’’ in Australia.
