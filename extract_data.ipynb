A legislated national consultative review of the RET was\\ncarried out in 2012, resulting in 8660 submissions. Respondents were invited to comment on the value of\\nthe legislated target, including whether the legislated target should be a ﬁxed GWh target or a ﬁxed\\npolicy-based percentage-of-demand target, and the impact of review processes on the renewable energy\\nindustry. This paper presents the ﬁrst analysis of submissions and evaluates their implications for the\\nfuture of this policy. There was a consistent alignment of opinion amongst respondents, with industry\\nand fossil-fuel generation/retailer groups opposing the RET objectives, whilst these were supported by\\nNGOs and the renewable sector. However, most respondents favoured maintaining the overall goal of\\nproviding 20% renewable electricity generation by 2020. Concerns were raised by most groups of re-\\nspondents regarding policy continuity and excessive reviewing procedures. In its response to the review,\\nthe Climate Change Authority made a total of 34 recommendations, 18 maintaining the status quo. Only\\nsix recommendations were endorsed by the Australian Government that would result in changes to the\\nscheme. It is concluded that such review processes can be signiﬁcantly harmful to maintaining stability\\nand certainty in an industry requiring long-term commitment for investments, and that the Australian\\nGovernment continues to favour the status quo in responding to consultative review processes relating\\nto renewable energy policies.\\n\\n(cid:1) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction e the renewable energy target legislation and\\nreview processes in Australia\\n\\nThe role of renewable energy in replacing incumbent fossil-fuel\\ngenerating electricity systems is assuming greater signiﬁcance as\\ngovernments are under pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emis-\\nsions. The enduring question within the renewable energy policy\\nframework is how much support (economically and otherwise) the\\nrenewable energy industry requires to thrive.\\n\\nAustralia has had three manifestations of national legislation\\naimed at promoting the renewable energy industry and, in turn,\\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. The measurable outcome of\\nthese policies is to see an increase in the proportion of ‘clean’ gen-\\neration technologies in the electricity generation mix [1]. This is done\\nby requiring electricity retailers to source a proportion of the elec-\\ntricity for their customers from certiﬁed ‘clean’ generators through\\nthe purchase of renewable energy certiﬁcates, encompassing both\\n\\n* Corresponding author.

The ﬁrst of these reviews was the Tambling Re-\\nview in 2003, which invited submissions on the functioning of the\\ninitial legislation [1]. Subsequent to the Tambling Review were\\nfrequent additional review processes that considered the legislative\\nframework, speciﬁc aspects of the legislation and the interaction\\nbetween the legislation and other policy initiatives [2]. A review of\\nthe most recent incarnation of the legislation, to be undertaken by\\nthe independent Climate Change Authority, was initiated in August\\n2012 [1].\\n\\nThese review processes and the broader academic literature\\nregarding renewable energy certiﬁcates highlight various issues\\nwith the development of such policies. These include the lack of\\nappropriate consultation processes when developing legislation\\n[3]; the lack of certainty and consistency in renewable energy\\npolicies, in particular for small-scale renewable energy technolo-\\ngies [4]; and the on-going commitment to existing policies\\nfavouring the status quo and fossil-fuel generating industries in\\nparticular [5].\\n\\n\\x0cG. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135\\n\\n129\\n\\nKent and Mercer [6] proposed that the submissions made\\navailable as part of the 2003 Tambling Review provided potentially\\nthe most comprehensive overview of the status of Australia’s\\nrenewable energy sector. Ten years have elapsed since this review,\\nwith changes in Government, relevant legislation and industry over\\nthis time. An assessment of the submissions to the most recent\\nreview of the legislation, the 2012 Climate Change Authority’s re-\\nview of the RET, therefore provides insight into the current state of\\nthe renewable energy sector and perceptions of renewable legis-\\nlation and associated policy development processes.\\n\\n2. Material and methods\\n\\nThe Climate Change Authority undertook a consultative review\\nprocess, including the development of an issues paper for general\\ncomment, and a discussion paper that provided a draft of ﬁnal\\nrecommendations for further comment. There were 8660 sub-\\nmissions received in response to the Issues Paper (8500 campaign\\nsubmissions and 160 stakeholder submissions), with 54 responses\\nto the Discussion Paper [1]. Four roundtables and 60 one-on-one\\ninterviews were undertaken over the course of the review process.\\nThis assessment of the Australian Government’s Renewable\\nEnergy (Electricity) Act 2000 legislation and the associated Climate\\nChange Authority Review of the RET follows a similar approach to\\nKent and Mercer’s [6] evaluation of the Tambling Review process.\\nSubmissions to the Climate Change Authority’s Issues Paper were\\ncritically assessed against the questions posed within the Review\\nIssues Paper. All submissions were assessed according to criteria as\\noutlined in Kent and Mercer [6], namely the type of stakeholder,\\ntheir overall perspective of the legislation (whether they support or\\nreject its value) and any particular issues of note to the stakeholder.\\nParticular issues of interest were those surrounding the effects of\\nuncertainty in the legislation on industry, including in relation to\\nthe GWh target, the effects of continual review processes, and\\nperceptions of embedded policies favouring other technology\\ntypes, including a certiﬁcate multiplier for small-scale photovoltaic\\nsystems. Information on the number of responses to particular\\nthemes was recorded by stakeholder type (peak industry group,\\ncorporation, academic, individual, environmental NGO), with sup-\\nporting statements provided alongside each respondent’s details.\\nThe Final Review Report was released on 19 December 2012 [7].\\nThe Australian Government’s formal response to recommendations\\noutlined in the Final Review Report was released on 23 March 2013\\n[8]. The Climate Change Authority’s recommendations and the\\nAustralian Government’s response to the Climate Change Author-\\nity’s Review Report were examined. Analysis of the extent to which\\nthe Australian Government is prepared to undertake modiﬁcations\\nto the legislation in light of the Climate Change Authority’s ﬁndings\\nassisted in determining whether the review process is seen as\\nbeneﬁcial to Australia’s renewable energy industry or whether it is\\nan unnecessary disturbance.\\n\\nCollection of data for the research was via the Climate Change\\nAuthority website [7], which publishes all calls for submission,\\nsubmissions from stakeholders and the Review Report itself. The\\nAustralian Government published its response to the Climate\\nChange Authority’s Review Report and recommendations\\nthrough the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efﬁ-\\nciency website [8].\\n\\n3. Theory e Australia’s RET e targets, legislation and reviews\\n\\nThe ﬁrst of Australia’s renewable energy schemes came into\\nforce in April 2001 under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act\\n2000 [6]. The key measure of the Act was the initiation of the\\nMandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET), which was to see a 2%\\n\\nper annum increase to renewable energy generation by 2010, from\\na 1996/1997 10.5% baseline. Energy demand forecasts at the time of\\nsetting the target were used to equate the additional 2% renewable\\ngeneration to a GWh target, namely 9500 GWh, which was the\\nlegislated target included in the Act.\\n\\nPeriodic reviews of the scheme were included as a requirement\\nin the legislation. The Tambling Review in 2003 invited sub-\\nmissions on the functioning of the MRET [9]. The review process\\ndetermined that an increase in electricity demand between the\\nscheme’s initiation and the time of review had resulted in the\\n9500 GWh target equating to less than a 2% increase in renewable\\ngeneration. The Review Panel’s recommendations included main-\\ntaining the 9500 GWh target to 2010 and then increasing the target\\nto 2020 to promote industry investment. The Government sup-\\nported the maintenance of the 9500 GWh target but rejected the\\nproposal to expand the scheme. The Review Panel also considered\\namending the legislation to state a ﬁxed percentage target with a\\nﬂoating GWh value, as opposed to the ﬁxed GWh target. The Re-\\nview Panel recommended maintaining a ﬁxed GWh target to\\nensure certainty for investors.\\n\\nIn August 2009,\\n\\nlegislation was passed to implement the\\nexpanded national RET, which brought the former MRET and\\nexisting and proposed state and territory schemes into one national\\nscheme [10]. It expanded the previous MRET to a forecast 20%\\ncontribution to the electricity mix by 2020, set in the legislation as\\n45,000 GWh. The RET also included speciﬁc support for small-scale,\\nrooftop solar photovoltaic systems, through the ‘Solar Credits\\nMultiplier’ [1].\\n\\nIn June 2010, further legislation was passed to separate the\\nexpanded national RET into two parts, the Large-scale Renewable\\nEnergy Target (LRET), covering large-scale projects such as wind\\nfarms, commercial solar and geothermal, and the Small-scale\\nRenewable Energy Scheme (SRES), covering domestic photovol-\\ntaic, wind turbine and efﬁcient water-heating technologies [1]. The\\nlegislation separated the 45,000 GWh target into 41,000 GWh by\\n2020 for the LRET and a minimum 4000 GWh by 2020 for the SRES.\\nThe changes were designed to provide greater certainty for large-\\nscale renewable energy projects, households and installers of\\nsmall-scale renewable energy systems.\\n\\nTo date, the MRET and RET have resulted in renewable energy\\ncapacity almost doubling from 10,650 MW in 2001 to 19,700 MW in\\n2012 [1]. In spite of this, due to an increase in demand for electricity\\nwithin Australia, renewable electricity generation as a proportion of\\ntotal electricity generation per year has not changed signiﬁcantly\\nsince 2000/01, having grown from approximately 8% to 10%. Wind\\nand solar photovoltaic (PV) technology make up the majority of new\\nrenewable generation as a result of the MRET and RET [11]. Wind\\ngeneration has grown under the RET from 200 GWh in 2000/01 to\\n5800 GWh in 2010/11. Solar photovoltaic generation has increased\\nover the same time period from 50 GWh to 850 GWh (Fig. 1).\\n\\nUnder the 2011 updated legislation enacting the RET, the\\nClimate Change Authority was tasked with completing a review of\\nthe scheme before the end of 31 December 2012 [12]. While the\\nClimate Change Authority did not have a stipulated Terms of\\nReference for undertaking the review, any recommendation put\\nforward by the Authority may not be inconsistent with the objec-\\ntives of the Act, which were to a) encourage the additional gener-\\nation of electricity from renewable sources; b) reduce emissions of\\ngreenhouse gases in the electricity sector; and c) ensure renewable\\nenergy sources are ecologically sustainable [13].\\n\\n4. Results and discussion\\n\\nAll of the 160 stakeholder submissions were read and analysed\\naccording to areas of note within the Issues Paper. The 8500\\n\\n\\x0c130\\n\\nG. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135\\n\\nin the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within Australia,\\nwith many citing the Copenhagen Accord’s goal of a 5% reduction in\\nemissions relative to 2000 by 2020 as a primary driver for the need\\nto reduce emissions. A handful of respondents also focused on the\\nneed to invest in renewable energy generation to diversify Aus-\\ntralia’s electricity generation system, avoiding the impacts of\\nincreasing fossil fuel costs associated with ‘peak oil’ and exposure\\nto international gas markets.\\n\\nApproximately 14% of respondents to this portion of the Issues\\nPaper (N ¼ 132) argued for a reduction in the value of the 2020\\ntarget to match current demand forecasts. All but one of these re-\\nspondents were from corporations or industry groups with a\\nmixed-energy (fossil fuel and renewable) or fossil fuel focus. The\\nmajority of respondents noted increasing electricity costs associ-\\nated with the RET as damaging for business and that the Australian\\nGovernment should therefore endorse its initial commitment to\\n‘20% renewable energy by 2020’. Additionally, most stakeholders\\nstated that the 2012 implementation of a carbon pricing mecha-\\nnism in Australia meant there was no need for the RET. Re-\\nspondents stated that the RET should only be maintained to 2020 in\\norder to ensure investor certainty.\\n\\nWhile some renewable-focussed stakeholders supported an\\nincrease to the 2020 target, 89% of them requested that the current\\n2020 target be maintained (N ¼ 45). This is a counter-intuitive\\nresponse given it is renewable-focussed industry that is most\\nlikely to beneﬁt from an increase in the target. A total of 63% of all\\nrespondents requested that the target be maintained (N ¼ 132),\\nwith responses spread across all stakeholder groups except fossil-\\nfuel based corporations. The reasons for maintaining the target\\nwere varied, with many responses refuting reasons put forward to\\nreduce the target to updated demand projections. It was noted that\\ndemand forecasting practices are inherently unreliable and that\\nany number of changes in the future could alter the demand proﬁle.\\nThere was considerable speculation that making signiﬁcant\\nchanges to the RET as a result of the introduction of the carbon\\npricing mechanism may be unwise. It was suggested that Austral-\\nia’s carbon pricing mechanism may not be able to facilitate in-\\nvestment in renewable energy as a result of its currently low value,\\nthe exposure of the carbon price to international markets, and most\\nimportantly that the security of the carbon pricing mechanism is\\nnot assured. The Australian Government opposition party has\\nvowed to abolish the carbon pricing legislation if it gains power\\nfollowing the September 2013 General Election [14]. Importantly,\\nrespondents noted that the Australian Government’s explicit policy\\ncommitment was to meet ‘at least’ 20% of electricity demands in\\n2020 through renewable generation, and that this did not provide\\nfor a maximum renewable commitment. Finally, 38% of re-\\nspondents to this line of questioning (N ¼ 132) stated that the RET\\nshould be maintained at the current target level in order to main-\\ntain investor conﬁdence.\\n\\nInterestingly, only 6% of submissions responding to this line of\\nquestioning suggested unequivocally that the RET should be\\n\\nFig. 1. Renewable energy generation in Australia, by year, from the initiation of the\\nMandatory Renewable Energy Target [11].\\n\\ncampaign submissions were derived from two key sources: GetUp,\\na grassroots community advocacy group (7806 submissions); and\\nHepburn Wind, a co-operative implementing the ﬁrst community-\\ninitiated wind farm in Australia (694 submissions). With each of\\nthese two groups of campaign submissions treated as a single\\nstakeholder submission, the total number of submissions assessed\\nwas 162 (Table 1).\\n\\nThe following discussion focuses on issues cited most frequently\\nby industry and the public with regard to the RET and is applicable\\nto other international renewable certiﬁcate trading mechanisms.\\n\\n4.1. Real, revised and projected e changes to the RET Target value\\n\\nA major focus of the RET review was the consideration of\\nwhether the Target should be increased, decreased or maintained\\nat the current legislated level. The decision to reassess the target\\nwas largely in response to reductions in energy demand forecasts\\nresulting in the 45,000 GWh target making up approximately 26%\\nof expected electricity demand by 2020/21 [1]. Reasons cited by\\nrespondents for the reduction in demand included increased small-\\nscale renewable system installation, installation of energy efﬁcient\\nappliances, milder summers and winters and changes to the in-\\ndustrial nature of Australia (closing of manufacturing and pro-\\ncessing plants).\\n\\nApproximately 17% of stakeholders responding to this line of\\nquestioning (N ¼ 132) requested an increase in the target to 2020.\\nRespondents recommending an increase to the target were pri-\\nmarily non-government associations and individuals (17 re-\\nsponses), and renewable-focus corporations and industry groups (5\\nresponses). The majority of these responses argued for an increase\\n\\nTable 1\\nBreakdown of submissions for the Climate Change Authority RET Review Issues Paper, by stakeholder type and attitude towards the RET.\\n\\nIndustry Groups and Corporations e Renewable energy focus e Small-scale and large-scale renewables,\\n\\nrenewable-based engineering ﬁrms, combined generation/retailers\\n\\nIndustry Groups and Corporations e Mixed focus e supply renewable and non-renewable, retailers,\\n\\nnetwork operators\\n\\nIndustry Groups and Corporations e High energy consumption, fossil fuel based inc waste coal mine gas\\nNGO/Association e environmental/climate interests\\nIndividual e member of public, energy consultant, academic, campaign submissions\\nOther e Government, independent body, think tank, independently legislated ofﬁce, unspeciﬁed\\n\\n47\\n\\n23\\n\\n21\\n16\\n42\\n13\\n\\n47\\n\\n16\\n\\n1\\n16\\n36\\n6\\n\\n0\\n\\n3\\n\\n11\\n0\\n0\\n4\\n\\n0\\n\\n4\\n\\n9\\n0\\n6\\n3\\n\\nN (162)\\n\\nSupport\\nthe RET\\n\\nAgainst\\nthe RET\\n\\nNo comment\\n\\n\\x0cG. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135\\n\\n131\\n\\nabolished. All but one of these submissions stated that the main\\nreason for abolishing the RET was that it was no longer required as a\\ncarbon pricing mechanism had been established, and that the RET\\ndid not provide least-cost abatement. This is in spite of the fact that,\\nof those respondents stating whether they supported or opposed\\nthe RET, 13% were against its inception. The difference between the\\nnumber of stakeholders opposing the RET and the number rec-\\nommending its abolition stems from the realisation that the RET\\nhas become a component of the Australian energy market, and that\\nconsiderable investment by business has been made with regard to\\nthe RET. Both sides of the RET debate, those supporting and\\ninvesting in renewables and those reliant on fossil-fuel generation,\\nincreasingly understand the importance of maintaining investor\\nconﬁdence in Australia by ensuring stability in policy. Increase in\\nsovereign risk associated with changes to the RET, even if incre-\\nmental, were deemed to extend beyond the renewable energy\\nsector to other areas of the Australian industrial economy.\\n\\nKent and Mercer [6] noted that the Tambling Review Panel\\nrecommended maintaining the legislated target to ensure industry\\ncertainty. Additionally, the Australian Government agreed to a GWh\\ntarget in Parliament on three separate occasions in 2000 [15], 2008\\n[16] and 2010 [17]. The reasons behind this conclusion have not\\nchanged, and therefore there is reason to question why the target\\nwas reassessed given it was not speciﬁcally required within the\\nClimate Change Authority’s remit. The removal of subsection 162(h)\\nfrom the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 [18], that the\\nReview must include consideration of ‘the level of the overall target\\nand interim targets’, was included within the Renewable Energy\\n(Electricity) Amendment Act 2009 [19]. Though the explanatory\\nmemorandum makes no speciﬁc mention of why this requirement\\nwas repealed [20], its removal does indicate that consideration of\\nthe target’s value was deemed unnecessary.\\n\\nLeading up to the initiation of the review process there was\\nconsiderable scrutiny of the GWh value of the target within the\\nAustralian media. Media interest was driven in large part by fossil-\\nfuel based generation corporations and high electricity consumers\\nnoting ﬁnancial\\nimplications associated with the RET [21,22].\\nRenewable interest groups were then vocally opposed to the\\nreduction of the target in response to industry demands, citing this\\n[23,24]. Kent and Mercer’s [6]\\nas self-interested behaviour\\nconcluding remarks note that respondents will be inherently self-\\ninterested in their contributions to consultative policy develop-\\nment processes. The case of stakeholder responses to the target\\nreview is clearly an example of this assertion in practice, with the\\npower of stakeholders and the media apparently inﬂuencing re-\\nview panel decisions to the potential detriment of the renewable\\nenergy industry.\\n\\n4.2. To review or not to review? e frequency of review processes\\n\\nOne of the most repetitive themes within submissions to the\\nClimate Change Authority Review process was the potentially\\ndamaging impact of the Review process itself. The Review process\\nwas a legislative requirement of the RET scheme, however, the\\nlength of time between implementation of the most recent (2010)\\nchanges to the scheme and the initiation of the Review process was\\nseen as unnecessarily short. 60% of respondents to the section of\\nthe Issues Paper requesting consideration of the frequency of re-\\nviews (N ¼ 70), from across the full spectrum of stakeholders, noted\\nthat the main concern in relation to future review processes was\\nthe need to maintain policy certainty and ensure minimal disrup-\\ntion to industry. 77% of stakeholders stated that the legislation\\nshould be amended so that there would be more than two years\\nbetween each review process (N ¼ 70). An additional 9% of re-\\nit was not appropriate to change\\nspondents indicated that\\n\\nlegislation to increase time between reviews, as this would create\\nadditional investment insecurity, but that the scope of future re-\\nviews should be limited considerably and should be made explicit\\nwell ahead of time. In particular, many respondents noted that\\nthere should be only a long-run ﬁxed review timetable, limited to\\ndetermining whether future targets were large enough to support\\non-going renewable energy investment, with smaller reviews un-\\ndertaken only when a certain threshold had been reached, for\\ninstance when the shortfall penalty charge (which acts as a price\\nceiling in the certiﬁcate market) was being paid instead of pur-\\nchasing large-scale renewable certiﬁcates.\\n\\nThe focus of submissions on the length of time between review\\nprocesses was unsurprising considering the negative consequences\\nof concurrent and frequent review processes was noted within the\\nTambling Review. The Parer Review, which was undertaken\\nconcurrently with the Tambling Review, examined the most cost-\\neffective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and found\\nthat the MRET was inefﬁcient and that an emissions trading scheme\\nwould result in greater environmental beneﬁts [6]. These review\\nﬁndings, and the fact that both review processes were undertaken\\nconcurrently, were found to create a level of uncertainty within the\\nelectricity generation industry. This situation was later echoed with\\nthe ﬁnalisation of the RET legislation reportedly overshadowed by\\nthe release of the White Paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction\\nScheme (the Australian Government’s emissions trading scheme)\\nand associated claims by industry that such a scheme would in-\\ncrease electricity costs [10]. The on-going lack of clarity in the\\nrelationship between review processes, potential subsequent\\nchanges to RET legislation, and the interaction between the RET and\\nan emissions trading scheme creates long-term uncertainty for\\nindustry.\\n\\nIn addition to the recurring theme of uncertainty surrounding\\non-going review processes, stakeholders also noted ‘review fatigue’,\\nwith ten review processes speciﬁcally related to the RET in the last\\nﬁve years [2], naught resulting in substantial changes to the policy\\nframework. The Australian Government’s decision to provide op-\\nportunities for stakeholder feedback at multiple steps in the devel-\\nopment of legislation is evidence of its preference for consultative\\npolicy-development processes, a system which is increasingly be-\\ning questioned. Crase et al. [25] found that such community\\nconsultation processes may be inefﬁcient as successive consultation\\nprocesses may contain unique questions and responses to the extent\\nthat each consultation process must be started anew, without an\\nopportunity for policy-makers to learn from the outcomes of pre-\\nvious consultation processes. Contrary to this, the RET Issues Paper\\nresponses indicate that the opposite is true e stakeholders are\\ngrowing increasingly frustrated with covering similar material, with\\nthe same outcomes, in on-going review processes. That the previous\\nreview processes have been ineffectual in creating marked change to\\nthe policy environment, for the betterment of industry or with\\nadditional environmental beneﬁts,\\nindicates that these review\\nprocesses are ultimately more likely to result in delays in investment\\nand industry uncertainty. As one respondent to the Issues Paper put\\nit, ‘constant review is not reform’ [26].\\n\\n‘Picking winners’ in renewable energy policy e the solar credits\\n\\n4.3.\\nmultiplier and other schemes\\n\\nThe Solar Credits Multiplier was introduced to the RET in 2009\\nby the Australian Government as a replacement for the over-\\nsubscribed $8000 Solar Homes and Communities Grant [1]. In\\ncreating the Solar Credits Multiplier the Australian Government\\nwas able to shift the ﬁnancial burden of the Grant from their own\\nto electricity consumers. The Australian Government\\nbudget\\ninitially designed the scheme with a ﬁve times multiplier, reducing\\n\\n\\x0c132\\n\\nG. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135\\n\\neach ﬁnancial year to one [1]. Additionally, each small-scale\\nphotovoltaic system received generation certiﬁcates based on a\\nforecast 15 year ‘deeming period’ [1]. The combination of the solar\\ncredits multiplier and the deeming period led to an initial upfront\\nrebate equivalent to 75 years of generation. The 75 years of gen-\\neration for a system at the initial certiﬁcate price was equivalent to\\napproximately $7500 [1], close to the value of the Grant the Solar\\nCredits Multiplier was replacing.\\n\\nThe Solar Credits Multiplier was credited with increasing uptake\\nof small-scale solar systems, with 18% of respondents to this line of\\nquestioning noting that the scheme resulted in substantial invest-\\nment (N ¼ 68). However, a larger proportion of submissions criti-\\ncised the use of the policy to stimulate investment. A conﬂuence of\\nfactors was cited as causing the Solar Credits Multiplier scheme to\\nbecome oversubscribed, including the initiation of generous state-\\nbased feed-in tariff schemes and increased demand creating scales\\nof economies that reduced the price of systems. In response to the\\nincreased generation of certiﬁcates associated with the scheme the\\nAustralian Government decreased the multiplier ahead of schedule\\non two occasions [1], resulting in uncertainty for the small-scale\\nsolar industry. With regards to the Issues Paper submissions,\\nthree key criticisms of the Solar Credits Multiplier were proposed.\\n\\n4.3.1.\\n\\n‘Phantom credits’\\n\\nThe Solar Credits Multiplier was unfavourably received by 18\\nrespondents who noted that the multiplication of ‘real’, deemed\\ncertiﬁcates created ‘phantom credits’: certiﬁcates that did not\\nequate to actual abatement and yet still contributed to the\\nachievement of the target. There were even calls by some re-\\nspondents that the RET target value should be increased to take into\\naccount the generation of phantom credits. The exact number of\\nphantom credits allocated under the RET between the initiation of\\nthe scheme in 2009 and the ﬁnal generation of credits at the end of\\n2012 has not been made public. However, data available through\\nthe Clean Energy Regulator indicates that ‘phantom credits’ could\\nhave contributed approximately 66% of the certiﬁcates required to\\nmeet the RET target value between 2009 and 2012 (Table 2).\\n\\n4.3.2. Boomebust cycles\\n\\nThe reduction of multipliers over time was found to create large\\nsurges in sales prior to the reduction of a multiplier, with house-\\nholders attempting to take advantage of the higher rebates, fol-\\nlowed by bust periods with reduced householder investment,\\nresulting in boomebust cycles noted by nine respondents. Data\\navailable from the Clean Energy Regulator [27] reﬂect the reality of\\nboomebust cycles, with peaks in small-scale installation rates\\ncoincident with the end of multiplier periods (Fig. 2). The boome\\nbust cycles were felt doubly by installers e not only were market\\nsales of small-scale renewable systems experiencing ﬂuctuations in\\ndemand but there were coincident ﬂuctuations in the value of\\ngeneration certiﬁcates sold within the RET market. The drastic\\n\\nTable 2\\nNumber of renewable energy certiﬁcates required under the RET 2009e2012,\\ncompared to an estimation of the number of ‘phantom credits’ generated in this\\nperiod.

Reductions in the number of installations subsequent to re-\\nductions in the multiplier are indicative of ‘boom and bust’ cycles. Data collected from\\nthe Clean Energy Regulator [27].\\n\\nreduction in demand for certiﬁcates, and reduction in their value,\\nled to several members of the small-scale solar industry entering\\nreceivership [30]. One submission also credited reduced installa-\\ntion quality and education of customers, including appropriate\\nsystem choice and system orientation, with installers trying to rush\\ninstallations through within higher multiplier time periods [31].\\n\\n4.3.3. REC overhang\\n\\nThe introduction of phantom credits, combined with the over-\\nsubscription to the scheme, resulted in an excessive number of\\ncertiﬁcates being generated. There were two closely associated\\noutcomes: the larger than expected number of certiﬁcates gener-\\nated through the market resulted in retailers purchasing enough\\ncertiﬁcates to cover their RET liability for several years, reducing\\nfuture demand for certiﬁcates. The reduction in demand for cer-\\ntiﬁcates led to a drop in the market value of certiﬁcates still being\\nsold through the market, to the extent that the construction of new\\nlarge-scale installations is no longer viable. This ‘overhang’ of cer-\\ntiﬁcates and the devaluation of RECs was noted by 18 respondents.\\nlarge-scale renewable energy by\\nWhile the crowding-out of\\nexcessive small-scale generation was remedied through the sepa-\\nration of the RET into the LRET and SRES, with separate GWh targets\\nand certiﬁcate types, the REC overhang still exists, with many re-\\ntailers still stockpiling enough RECs to meet obligations out to\\n2015/2016, essentially stalling investment in large-scale generation\\nfor the period between 2011 and 2015/16.\\n\\nKent and Mercer [6] found that mandating of particular tech-\\nnologies (through multiple certiﬁcates and excess quotas) was near\\nunanimously opposed in submissions to the Tambling Review, as it\\nwas deemed as a way of ‘picking winners’ in regards to technology\\ntypes as opposed to allowing the most economically efﬁcient\\ntechnologies to advance. Claims by small-scale renewable energy\\nindustry in the media that the Solar Credits Multiplier was required\\nto promote the installation of systems and support the small-scale\\nindustry [32] were ultimately off-set by responses to the Issues\\nPaper that the Solar Credits Multiplier was inefﬁcient and resulted\\nin unnecessarily high increases in electricity tariffs. Ross et al. [3]\\nnoted that renewable energy policies that generate high levels of\\nindustry growth over the short-term, but cannot be sustained\\nﬁnancially, undermine long-term industry development. Further-\\nmore, Valentine [33] indicated that the Solar Credits Multiplier was\\nharmful to the renewable energy sector in that it allowed small-\\nscale systems to outcompete utility-scale development. The Solar\\nCredits Multiplier then proved all these assertions correct: it was\\n\\n\\x0cG. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135\\n\\n133\\n\\nshown to increase the demand for small-scale solar photovoltaic\\nsystems to the extent that economies of scale were achieved, but it\\nwas also found to have negative, cascading effects across the\\nrenewable energy market and to all electricity consumers. That 87%\\nof respondents referring to this line of question (N ¼ 68) either\\nrejected the use of multipliers (or banding) in future, and/or noted\\nthe negative impacts of the Solar Credits Multiplier to the scheme,\\nindicates that the Solar Credits Multiplier was ultimately delete-\\nrious to the RET scheme. Approximately 19% of respondents sup-\\nported the use of multipliers (or banding), and then only in speciﬁc\\ncases where generation of certiﬁcates was likely to be low, with\\nmany of these respondents also noting that the Solar Credits\\nMultiplier had resulted in undesirable outcomes in the RET.\\n\\n4.3.4.\\n\\nIncumbent support for other technology types\\n\\nThere was considerable criticism within Issues Paper sub-\\nmissions regarding the inclusion of two additional support mech-\\nanisms for technologies. The inclusion of waste coal mine gas\\nreceived particular criticism from respondents,\\nin particular\\nbecause this is not an ‘ecologically sustainable’ renewable energy\\nsource, as is stipulated in the RET legislation. The inclusion of waste\\ncoal mine gas is as a result of the harmonisation of jurisdictional\\ntargets prior to the 2009 expansion of the RET [1], including New\\nSouth Wales’ support for waste coal mine gas. As only waste coal\\nmine gas generation systems built in New South Wales during its\\ntarget scheme are supported competitive inequity exists between\\ngenerators wanting to utilise waste coal mine gas. 64% of the re-\\nspondents to this line of questioning (N ¼ 42) explicitly requested\\nits removal from the RET, with only two respondents requesting\\nthat new waste coal mine gas be capable of generating certiﬁcates\\nunder the RET. The remainder of respondents all proposed main-\\ntaining the current arrangements, to provide on-going support to\\nexisting facilities or simply to ensure that the legislative framework\\nremained unchanged.\\n\\nThe inclusion of technologies that do not generate electricity but\\nmay displace the use of electricity e so-called displacement tech-\\nnologies e was an area of contention within submissions, with 42%\\nof respondents to this line of questioning supporting displacement\\ntechnologies’ removal from the scheme, and 39% supporting its\\nexpansion to other technology types (N ¼ 31). The 2001 MRET\\nincluded support for small-scale solar water heaters and heat pump\\nin these\\nwater heaters as a way of promoting investment\\n\\nmanufacturing industries in Australia [34]. While the majority of\\nthese systems are now imported into Australia the legacy of sup-\\nporting this industry, particularly in light of its contribution to\\nenergy efﬁcient technology uptake, has led to the view that support\\nfor this industry is still useful. The inclusion of solar water heaters\\nand heat pump water heaters in the RET continues to be conten-\\ntious, not only for the fact that these are not renewable electricity\\ngeneration resources, but also because new displacement tech-\\nnologies, in particular cogeneration and ground source heat pumps,\\nare not included in the RET.\\n\\nThe lack of alternative schemes to appropriately support waste\\ncoal mine gas generation and displacement technologies, and\\ncontinuing concern that the carbon pricing mechanism may prove\\ninadequate or be revoked, led the Climate Change Authority to\\nrecommend retaining both mechanisms, with the outcome that\\ninequity will continue to exist between waste coal mine gas gen-\\nerators and elements of the displacement industry.\\n\\nLindblom’s [35]\\n\\n‘disjointed incrementalism’, where policy-\\nmakers pursue a limited range of well-analysed policy alterna-\\ntives, is particularly relevant in this case, which sees an inherently\\nconservative approach to policy-making preferred. Kent and\\nMercer [6] found this policy development technique was typiﬁed in\\nthe development of the former Liberal (conservative) Govern-\\nment’s MRET. Consistent with the incremental policy development\\nprocess, the Liberal Australian Government’s response to the\\nTambling Review’s ﬁndings had emphasised a ‘business-as-usual’\\npolicy framework, with fossil-fuel continuing to dominate the en-\\nergy sector in future. In this case the Climate Change Authority has\\nalso favoured a ‘business-as-usual’ policy framework that favours\\nboth the incumbent renewable generators, but also support\\nmechanisms that may not serve the objectives of the RET to provide\\nleast-cost renewable generation.\\n\\n4.4. Climate change authority review recommendations and\\ngovernment response\\n\\nOn completing the consultation process, the Climate Change\\nAuthority produced a Final Review Report that included 34 rec-\\nommendations for the Australian Government’s consideration [1].\\nOf these 34 recommendations, 18 supported the existing scheme,\\nﬁve recommended further review, consultation or assessment and\\n11 proposed changes to the scheme (Table 3). Of these 11 only six\\n\\nTable 3\\nSummary of the Climate Change Authority recommendations with regard to the Renewable Energy Target (including recommendation number), and the Australian Gov-\\nernment response to these recommendations [1,8].\\n\\nAccepted\\n\\nFurther work required\\n\\nRejected\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\nfor change\\n\\n- Four years between reviews recommended [1]\\n- SRES should be phased out by reducing the\\n\\ndeeming period, starting in 2017 [8]\\n\\n- Over-surrendered certiﬁcates to be refunded [17]\\n- Changes to scheme administration [10,11,15]\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\nfor further review\\nor consideration\\n\\n- Adjustments to targets beyond 2020 [4]\\n- Level of Partial Exemption Certiﬁcate for Emissions\\nIntensive Trade Exposed Industries considered by\\nProductivity Commission [19]\\n\\n- Consider impact of RET on competitiveness of\\n\\nemissions intensive trade exposed industries [20]\\n\\n- Align auditing between RET and other Commonwealth\\n\\nreporting measures [22]\\n\\nRecommendations for\\n\\n- 18 recommendations for no change [2,3,5,7,12,14,16,\\n\\nmaintenance of existing\\ncharacteristics\\n\\n18,23,25e27,29e34]\\n\\n- Large-scale consumers can ‘opt in’ to\\nbuy certiﬁcates directly from the\\nmarket [13]\\n\\n- Threshold for small-scale systems\\n\\nchanged from 100 kW to 10 kW [6]\\n\\n- Clearing house to be converted to\\n\\n- Partial Exemption Certiﬁcates for\\n\\n‘deﬁcit sales house’ [9]\\n\\nEmissions-Intensive Trade Exposed\\nIndustries made tradeable [21]\\n\\n- Self-generator deﬁnition amended to\\nallow incidental off-take of electricity\\nby community groups [24]\\n\\n- Further analysis into inclusion of\\n\\nNative Forrest biomass in the RET [28]\\n\\n\\x0c134\\n\\nG. Simpson, J. Clifton / Renewable Energy 67 (2014) 128e135\\n\\nwere accepted outright, with three of these accepted recommen-\\ndations covering minor administrative components of the scheme\\n[8]. The key recommendation accepted by the Australian Govern-\\nment conﬁrmed that the periodical review process would be un-\\ndertaken only once every four years. The other recommendation\\nwith appreciable effects on the renewable energy industry related\\nto the decision to reduce the deeming of certiﬁcates from 15 years,\\nhowever this will not come into effect until 2017.\\n\\nThe review process therefore supported relatively incremental\\nchanges to the policy. Given no great changes have been suggested\\nto promote increased uptake of renewable energy, or conversely to\\nprovide additional support for electricity consumers suffering un-\\nder the burden of the RET, the review process is likely to have\\ncaused more harm than good purely by introducing a perception of\\npolicy uncertainty. While the outcomes of the review process\\nsuggest that the Climate Change Authority has taken heed of the\\nadvice from industry to minimise changes to the scheme, and the\\nAustralian Government has gone one step further to maintain the\\nstatus quo within the Scheme, there may be value in determining\\nwhether the Review should have been undertaken at all, particu-\\nlarly given the Australian Government’s apparent preference for\\nmaintaining the status quo in the majority of review processes.\\n\\nThe case of the 2012 Climate Change Authority Review of the\\nRET, and the Australian Government’s response, could therefore be\\nconsidered ‘choreographed consultation’. Cheeseman and Smith\\n[36] found that a consultative policy-development process resulted\\nin little actual inﬂuence on policy direction, but that the consulta-\\ntion process garnered support for policies already in train. If any-\\nthing, the RET review process allowed the Australian Government\\nto cite support from a variety of stakeholders, including industry\\nand the general public, with regard to the implementation of pol-\\nicies to support renewable energy in Australia. In doing so, the\\nAustralian Government was able to rebuke claims from industry\\nthat it would be in Australian consumers’ best interests to support a\\ndecrease to the 45,000 GWh target.\\n\\n5. Conclusion\\n\\nThe submissions to the RET Issues Paper demonstrate that\\nwhile the RET mechanism is increasing the penetration of\\nrenewable technologies within Australia, and stakeholders,\\nincluding industry and the general public, are largely supportive of\\nthe Scheme, there are misgivings about some elements of the\\noperation of the Scheme. Primarily, stakeholders perceive that the\\nRET would be more successful if it was devoted to least-cost\\nrenewable technologies, and therefore sub-schemes that favour\\ntechnology types should not be included under the Scheme. The\\noverwhelming conclusion that can be drawn from the sub-\\nmissions, however, is that uncertainty within the policy environ-\\nment remains the key threat to meeting the RET scheme Target.\\nThis uncertainty is felt through the unknown interaction between\\nthe RET and the carbon pricing mechanism, the frequent intro-\\nduction of review processes that undermine investment certainty\\nand the interaction between state-based policies and the renew-\\nable energy industry. The necessity of ensuring a set GWh target\\nfor the RET, and providing conﬁdence to investors that this will\\nnot be amended, regardless of future potential review processes,\\ncannot be overstated. While the Climate Change Authority’s\\nrecommendation to maintain the current GWh target, and in-\\ncrease the time between reviews from two years to four years,\\ngoes some way to increasing conﬁdence within the renewable\\nenergy industry, the potential renegotiation of the target and re-\\nreview of the Scheme should the Australian Government change\\nhands in September 2013, undermines these efforts. In order for\\nthere to be true conﬁdence in the Target, bipartisan support of the\\n\\nRET, and implementation of all agreed recommendations of the\\nClimate Change Authority, is required.\\n\\nDisclosure statement\\n\\nThe primary author was employed as an energy policy ofﬁcer for\\nthe Western Australian Government from 2009 to 2012.

In 2011, the target was split into\\ntwo parts with separate targets, the Large-Scale Renewable Energy\\nTarget (LRET) covering utility scale renewable projects, and the\\nSmall-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) covering residential\\nsolar. In this paper, we focus on the LRET and associated invest-\\nment in (predominantly) wind energy.1\\n\\n1 The SRES and the associated build-up of distributed photovoltaic electricity\\ngeneration in Australia is likely to also have non-negligible distributional effects,\\nthe estimation of which is also impacted by the various State-based feed-in-tariffs\\nthat supported PV's initial deployment (Nelson et al., 2011).

Each certiﬁcate represents 1 MWh of electricity\\ngenerated by ‘new’ (that is, not pre-existing hydro) renewable\\nenergy sources. These Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs) can be\\ncreated by accredited large-scale renewable energy projects, gen-\\nerating LGCs (and small-scale renewable energy systems for the\\nSRES). RECs provide the additional revenue stream, beyond energy\\nmarket returns, that is required to implement renewable energy\\nprojects. There is an active market between liable parties and\\ncertiﬁcate providers for these RECs with associated spot and\\nforward prices that vary according to renewable energy project\\ncosts and electricity prices.\\n\\nSince its inception the RET has driven considerable investment\\nin renewable energy projects, and an increasing percentage of\\nelectricity consumption is now being provided from new renew-\\nable generation (Fig. 1). This expansion of electricity generated by\\nrenewables has several competing impacts on electricity prices in\\nthe short run. On the one hand, an increased penetration of\\nrenewables in wholesale electricity markets tends to lower the\\nspot price. This is due to the so-called merit order effect by which\\nrenewables that have close to zero short run marginal costs\\ndisplace higher operating cost generation and hence lower the\\noverall price required for supply to meet demand within the\\nwholesale electricity market (see Section 2).\\n\\nOn the other hand, the cost of green certiﬁcates, reﬂecting the\\nadditional investment costs of renewable generation, is added to\\nthe retail price of electricity by the retailer who passes the costs of\\ncomplying with their target on to consumers, or is paid for directly\\nby users who manage their own compliance. Besides a wholesale\\ncomponent and renewable energy scheme charges, residential\\nretail prices also include charges for transmission and distribution\\nnetworks. These network costs are, indeed, the major cost com-\\nIn 2012–13 residential retail prices in the Australian\\nponent.\\n(NEM) comprised estimated cost\\nNational Electricity Market\\ncomponents for transmission networks of 8% and distribution\\n\\nnetworks of 37%, a wholesale component including carbon costs\\nof 37% and a retail component of 17% that included an allowance\\nfor LRET and SRES costs of 3–4% (Fig. 2).\\n\\nOur analysis focuses on those components of retail prices\\nwhich are directly affected by the RET in the short term, namely\\nthe wholesale component and green scheme charges. We do not\\nconsider transmission or distribution network charges in the\\nanalysis. Instead, the aim of this paper is to investigate how the\\npotential ﬁnancial beneﬁts of the RET (lower wholesale prices in\\nthe short run) and its costs (increased retail prices due to the cost\\nof green certiﬁcates) are distributed amongst different groups of\\nelectricity consumers, and how design choices about the imple-\\nmentation of the RET affect this distribution.\\nIn particular, a\\nnumber of so-called energy-intensive trade-exposed industries\\nare largely exempt from contributing to the costs of the RET, while\\nthey could still beneﬁt from the reduction in wholesale prices\\ndriven by the scheme. The importance of this question has been\\nnoted by some stakeholders. For example, in their submission to\\nthe review of the RET, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory\\nTribunal of New South Wales notes: “As the overall RET target is\\nkept constant, these exemptions raise the costs of complying with\\nthe scheme for all other customers, particularly as the exempted\\nindustries can be large users of electricity and account for a\\nsigniﬁcant proportion of electricity use in Australia. To date, little\\nanalysis has been publicly provided on the impact of these\\nexemptions including the costs and beneﬁts to other electricity\\ncustomers.” (IPART, 2012b, p. 11). The Climate Institute (2012) has\\nalso raised concerns regarding these wealth transfers.\\n\\nFurthermore, this issue has been raised in some other jurisdic-\\nIn particular, a similar study has been conducted for\\ntions.\\nGermany and its Renewable Energy Support Act (EEG). The EEG\\nalso exempts energy-intensive companies from contributing to the\\ncost of the policy. In their paper Cludius et al. (2013) conclude that\\nthe merit order effect likely overcompensates energy-intensive\\nconsumers by a factor of twenty for their contribution to the cost\\nof the EEG. This, therefore, makes the scheme more costly than it\\nmight otherwise be for households and small business.\\n\\nWe expect that the Australian Renewable Energy Target (RET)\\nhas also led to potentially signiﬁcant distributional transfers\\nbetween households and large electricity consumers.

Furthermore, ﬁnancial RET\\nbeneﬁts to end-users – lower wholesale prices – may not be\\ncompletely passed forward to households through the process of\\nsetting retail tariffs by regulators. Analysing and addressing dis-\\ntributional effects can play a key role in achieving broad social\\nconsensus on the fairness and hence appropriateness of policy\\nimplementation (United Nations, 2006). As an example, the\\nAustralian Government introduced a large household assistance\\nprogramme alongside its introduction of a carbon price with the\\nexplicit intent of addressing potentially adverse distributional\\nimpacts arising from the policy, particularly on vulnerable house-\\nholds (Australian Government, 2011).\\n\\nDistributional issues, however, did not seem to feature greatly\\nin public discussions regarding the design and implementation of\\nthe extended RET (MacGill and Passey, 2009). More recently,\\nhowever, major rises in retail electricity prices have focussed\\ngreater public attention on cost drivers within the industry. Most\\nof these price increases have been driven by growing distribution\\nnetwork expenditure. However, renewable energy policy support\\nincluding the RET has also contributed and raised questions of\\noverall schemes costs and also their distribution. Discussions are\\nset to intensify in the future as LRET costs are expected to rise, as a\\nresult of both the progressively increasing level of the target\\n(obligations on retailers to source their electricity from renewable\\nsources are currently expected to more than double over the next\\nsix years)2 and rising LGC prices due to higher ﬁnancing costs for\\nrenewables projects (IPART, 2013). Furthermore, an abolition of the\\ncarbon price and an associated fall in wholesale electricity prices\\nwould also be expected to drive up prices for LGCs. Finally, results\\nof this study not only have implications for the RET, but also, more\\ngenerally, for ongoing discussions about the potential need and\\npossible nature of reform of both electricity wholesale and retail\\nmarkets in Australia.\\n\\nThe paper is structured as follows.

Section 3 presents regression results of the\\nreduction in wholesale prices caused by the merit order effect of\\nwind in the Australian NEM in 2011–12 and 2012–13.

Finally, Section 5 highlights the potential\\npolicy implications of these ﬁndings and concludes.\\n\\n2. Material and methods\\n\\n2.1. Estimating the merit order effect of wind in the Australian\\nNational Electricity Market (NEM)\\n\\nThe expansion of renewable generation in the NEM, in particular\\nthe large growth in wind capacity since the inception of policies\\npromoting renewable generation, has had a notable inﬂuence on\\nthe price of wholesale electricity. As with any additional supply, the\\nexpansion of wind generation has placed downward pressure on\\nwholesale prices. However, this phenomenon is more pronounced\\nin the case of wind generation due to the fact that it has a very low\\nshort run marginal cost. This systematic correlation between spot\\nprice and wind generation in the short run is known as the merit\\norder effect of wind generation.\\n\\nThe supply curve, or merit order, within a wholesale electricity\\nmarket is constructed by ordering the bids of all generators from\\nlowest to highest. In a scenario where no market power exists\\nthese bids should equate to the marginal costs of the generators\\nand therefore the supply curve reﬂect the aggregate marginal cost\\ncurve for the market. At the intersection of the supply and demand\\ncurves, the spot market price is set. All generators with lower marginal\\ncosts receive this uniform price and serve demand over the period of\\nthe wholesale spot market, which lasts half an hour in the NEM. Wind\\ntends to shift the supply curve to the right, due to its low marginal cost\\n\\n\\x0cJ.

This is called the merit order effect (see Forrest and\\nMacGill, 2013 for an in-depth discussion of the merit order effect).3\\n\\nThe merit order effect is a well-documented phenomenon (IEA,\\n2011). In general, two ways of estimating the effect exist. The ﬁrst\\napproach uses an electricity market model which compares two\\nscenarios, one with and one without the inclusion of renewables\\nand looks at the difference in resulting electricity wholesale prices\\n(de Miera et al., 2008; Sensfuß et al., 2008; Weigt, 2009). The\\nsecond approach uses time-series analysis of historical price and\\nload data (Cludius et al., 2013; Forrest and MacGill, 2013; Gelabert\\net al., 2011; Jónsson et al., 2010; Woo et al., 2011). While the\\nspeciﬁcation of an electricity market model has the potential to\\ncapture longer term effects, it requires careful calibration of a\\ncounterfactual scenario and available market models generally\\nhave signiﬁcant limitations. Time-series analysis, on the other\\nhand, does not have to make assumptions about alternative\\ndevelopments, but can only analyse short term effects, neglecting\\nissues such as investment costs in new generation or networks. It\\nmay also struggle to resolve the impact of renewables against a\\nwide range of other potential market drivers. Some techniques can\\ninclude elements of both approaches (McConnell et al., 2013). See\\nWürzburg et al. (2013) for a review of studies on the merit order\\neffect to date.\\n\\nforward market,\\n\\nThe Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) includes the\\nstates of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia\\nand Tasmania (the Australian Capital Territory is included in the\\nNSW region of the NEM). It covers around 90% of Australia's\\npopulation and electricity demand. The wholesale spot market is\\nunique in that it is ‘energy only’ with no capacity market or\\ntechnical\\nis compulsory (gross pool) for all\\ngenerators larger than 30 MW, uses ﬁve minute dispatch with\\n30 minute averaged pricing, requires participants to manage their\\nown unit commitment and allows participants to rebid their price-\\nquantity offers on a ﬁve minute basis (MacGill, 2010). The NEM\\nspot market is characterised by its extremely volatile prices by\\ncomparison with many other markets and during the study period\\noperated under a market ceiling price in any half hour\\nof $12,900/MWh and a market ﬂoor price of (cid:3) $1000/MWh.\\nAt present, each of the regions in the NEM has only limited\\ninterconnection with other regions and therefore each region has\\nits own dynamic wholesale price (AER, 2012).\\n\\nThe calculation builds on Forrest and MacGill (2013) who\\ncalculate the merit order effect between 2009 and 2011 for South\\nAustralia and Victoria. We extend this analysis by calculating the\\nmerit order effect for the NEM as a whole for the two years 2011–\\n12 and 2012–13. The wholesale price in the NEM is modelled as a\\nthe feed-in of wind (windt) and total demand\\nfunction of\\n\\n3 Note that depending on the way in which renewable generation is included\\nin the electricity market, it might also be represented as a reduction in demand.\\nThe overall effect in this stylised model, however, is identical.\\n\\nTable 2\\nDescriptive statistics – Demand and wind variables (MW).\\nSource: AEMO Database.\\n\\nVariable Mean\\n\\nStandard\\nDeviation\\n\\nMin\\n\\n1st\\nPercentile\\n\\nMedian 99th\\n\\nMax\\n\\nPercentile\\n\\n2011–12\\nDemand 23,275 3064\\n338\\nWind\\n\\n619\\n\\n2012–13\\nDemand 22,819 3072\\n390\\nWind\\n\\n701\\n\\n15,895 17,381\\n61\\n\\n0\\n\\n23,566 29,660\\n1395\\n\\n580\\n\\n31,959\\n1620\\n\\n15,466 17,120\\n56\\n\\n4\\n\\n23,064 29,791\\n1584\\n\\n649\\n\\n32,561\\n1932\\n\\n(demandt). The logarithmic transformation of the price takes\\naccount of the fact that the effect of wind is expected to be higher\\nat the high demand end. Dummy variables for seasonal trends on a\\ndaily timescale and a binary variable for weekends is also\\nincluded. To account for transient changes, an autoregressive term\\nis included in the model (Eq. (1)).\\nlnðpricetÞ ¼ c þγ lnðpricet (cid:3) 1Þ þα1windt þβ\\njSjt þη\\n\\n1W t þεt\\n\\n1demandt\\n\\nð1Þ\\n\\nμ\\n\\nþ∑\\nj\\n\\nWe use half-hourly data on wholesale spot prices, demand and\\nwind aggregated across the ﬁve regions of the NEM. The data was\\nextracted from the database located on the Australia Energy Market\\nOperator (AEMO) website (www.aemo.com.au). A national wholesale\\nspot price variable was created using a demand weighted average of\\nthe regional prices (Table 1) while demand and wind were added\\nacross regions (Table 2). For each of the data series used in the analysis\\nthe Phillips–Perron test for stationarity was conducted and all series\\nwere found to be stationary as expected, thus alleviating the concern\\nof spurious regression results.\\n\\nAt high levels of demand, price spikes can be observed that do not\\ncorrespond to marginal costs and are the result of a lack of competi-\\ntion in these situations (Twomey and Neuhoff, 2010). Therefore, the\\nspot price variable has been censored to between the values of\\n1 $/MWh and 415 $/MWh, reﬂecting a reasonable estimate of the\\nlowest and highest short run marginal costs of generators in the NEM.\\nConsequently, the estimate of the merit order effect can be considered\\nto be representative of ‘standard’ conditions in the market and not\\nthose periods effected by extremely low and high price events. It is\\nexpected that this approach leads to a more conservative estimate of\\nthe merit order effects due to the asymmetric magnitude and\\nfrequency of low and high price events. Further, by taking a national\\napproach, we determine an estimate of the merit order effect of the\\nNEM as a whole, and neglect potential interregional differences and\\ninterconnection effects.\\n\\nAverage half-hourly demand was about 400 MW lower in 2012–13\\nthan in 2011–12, which can be explained by a range of reasons, such as\\nweather conditions, a rising share of distributed energy sources and\\n\\n\\x0c44\\n\\nJ.

Average electricity generated by\\nwind increased by 100 MW. Wholesale spot electricity prices, how-\\never, nearly doubled between 2011–12 and 2012–13. The main driver\\nof this difference is the introduction of the ﬁxed carbon price in July\\n2012, and, to a lesser extent, the fact that moderate weather conditions\\nand signiﬁcant hydro availability coupled with falling demand and\\nincreased feed-in of renewables made 2011–12 a year of historically\\nlow wholesale prices. Retail prices rose by 15% between the two years,\\nwith the wholesale component including the carbon price being\\nresponsible for 38% of this price rise, and rising transmission and\\ndistribution network costs for 43% (AEMC, 2013b).\\n\\n2.2. The market for Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs), RET costs\\nand exemptions\\n\\nEach year, liable parties under the RET – that is, those that\\nmake “relevant acquisitions of electricity” – have to submit a\\nmandated number of certiﬁcates. In practice these liable parties\\nare mostly retailers, although there are some end-users that\\nacquire their obligation directly from renewable energy projects\\n(Climate Change Authority, 2012). The exact number of certiﬁcates\\nto be submitted is determined by the Renewable Power Percen-\\ntage (RPP), which is applied to the amount of electricity bought by\\neach liable party. The percentage is set at a level that ensures the\\n20% target of the RET will be reached in 2020. The shortfall charge\\nis set at 65 $/MWh. As certiﬁcate purchases are tax deductible,\\nwhile the shortfall charge is not, the penalty is larger in real terms.\\nEach Renewable Energy Certiﬁcate (REC) represents 1 MWh of\\nelectricity generated by accredited renewable energy projects. Fig. 3\\nshows the evolution of spot prices for Large-scale Generation Certiﬁ-\\ncates (LGCs) for the time period under investigation. LGC prices have\\nfallen from around $40 in mid-2011 to below $35 in mid-2013.\\nIn theory, certiﬁcate prices should reﬂect the difference between the\\nprice of electricity that can be earned on the wholesale market and the\\nlong run marginal cost of the most economically efﬁcient renewable\\ngeneration technology. The price is, however, also inﬂuenced by\\npolitical events impacting the current and expected stringency of\\nrenewable energy policy. Nelson et al. (2013) note that prices have\\ngenerally been lower than this expected difference. This is mainly due\\nto uncertainty regarding the future of the RET and an oversupply of\\npermits that occurred due to a multiplier for credits generated by\\n\\nsmall-scale solar, which had been introduced in 2009 when the target\\nwas expanded. This oversupply was one of the reasons for splitting the\\ntarget into the two different components in 2011.\\n\\nTwo types of exemptions from liability under the RET exist: (i) self-\\nconsumption and (ii) Emissions-intensive trade-exposed industry\\n(EITE). Since the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) and therefore\\nthe impact of RET costs on electricity prices depends on the total liable\\nelectricity consumption, the more exemptions, the more expensive the\\nscheme becomes for the non-exempt parties: “The broader the base\\nfor liability, the smaller the impact for any individual liable party. For\\nit is generally more efﬁcient and equitable to keep\\nthis reason,\\nexemptions to a minimum.” (Climate Change Authority, 2012)\\n\\nThe original MRET had a clearly articulated principle that energy\\nconsumers should pay according to their consumption (Tambling,\\n2003). However, exemption provisions were introduced together with\\nthe expansion of the RET in 2009 and took effect in 2010. Eligible\\nactivities can apply for partial exemption certiﬁcates (PECs). PECs\\nremove RET liability for the volume of electricity (in MWh) which is\\nspeciﬁed in the PEC. Those PECs are then passed on from the exempt\\nuser to their retailer under the assumption that the retailer then has\\nlower liability and passes only a fraction of RET costs on to the EITE\\nactivity.\\n\\nThe rationale behind exempting certain industries is that some\\nindustries compete within an international market and thus may\\nnot be able to pass RET costs on to consumers in the form of higher\\nprices. Consumers might, instead, substitute their product with\\none produced by a company that does not face environmental\\nregulations in their country. Furthermore, industry might decide\\nto relocate to jurisdictions with less stringent environmental\\nregulation. This process of shifting greenhouse related emissions\\nabroad is called ‘carbon leakage’. The true extent of carbon leakage\\ndepends on both the emissions- and trade-intensity of\\nthe\\nindustry in question and other barriers that might impede reloca-\\ntion of production or substitution of consumption, such as trans-\\nportation costs or local factors (Dröege et al., 2009; European\\nCommission, 2010).\\n\\nThe list of EITE activities that qualify for RET exemption is the\\nsame as for exemptions from the Australian carbon price. Highly\\nemissions-intensive activities include aluminium and zinc smelt-\\ning, petroleum reﬁning, the manufacture of iron and steel and the\\nmanufacture of newsprint. They are exempt from 90% of RET costs.\\n\\n\\x0cJ.

We estimate\\nindicative net effects for nine combinations of possible pass-\\nthrough rates as illustrated in Table 4. Analysed pass-through\\nrates of RET costs range from 100% to 10%, corresponding to the\\nexemption rates (0% for households and small business; 60% or\\n90% for energy-intensive industry), while the pass-through effect\\nof the merit order effect is analysed at indicative levels of 0%, 50%\\nand 100% (representing a case where electricity prices are not,\\npartially or fully aligned to wholesale price movements).\\n\\nPass-through of the merit order effect to an individual con-\\nsumer depends on whether or not retail prices or tariffs are\\naligned to wholesale price movements. The extent to which this\\nis the case is expected to depend on (i) whether a user is subject to\\na regulated retail tariff or has the ability to negotiate their own\\ncontract and, in case the user is on a retail tariff, (ii) the method by\\nwhich the wholesale energy purchase cost allowance is calculated\\nby the regulator in the user's jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe pass-through of RET costs is likely to primarily depend on\\nthe extent of exemption from RET costs of the individual con-\\nsumer, therefore, we analyse pass-through of RET costs at 10%\\n(exempt industry, high exemption), 40% (exempt industry, med-\\nium exemption) and 100% (no exemption, households and small\\nbusiness).\\nthe\\napproach taken by the regulator to determine the green scheme\\nallowance will again play a role.\\n\\nIn jurisdictions with regulated retail prices,\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\n3.1. The impact of the RET on prices in the Australian National\\nElectricity Market (NEM)\\n\\nThis section presents results of the regression model for the\\ntwo years 2011–12 and 2012–13 respectively (Tables 5 and 6).\\nThe years were analysed separately due to the introduction of the\\ncarbon price and its impact on wholesale prices. In order to\\naccount for the fact that the data has been censored a Tobit model\\nhas been used to estimate the parameter coefﬁcients in the model.\\nFurthermore, due to the possible presence of serial correlation,\\n\\n4 Exemptions are not granted for the MRET share of the RET, i.e. for the ﬁrst\\n9500 GWh everyone is fully liable. If this provision was removed, it would add\\nanother 0.36 $/MWh to RET costs for remaining liable parties (Climate Change\\nAuthority, 2012).\\n\\nstatistical signiﬁcance was assessed by looking at the maximum of\\nstandard errors from the Tobit model and an OLS model with\\nNewey–West standard errors.\\n\\nAll coefﬁcients are estimated highly precisely and have the\\nexpected sign, i.e. additional generation by wind has a negative\\nimpact on the electricity price, while additional demand has a\\npositive impact. The coefﬁcients can be used to estimate the expected\\nprice reduction at a speciﬁc wind output. From these results, it is\\npossible to develop an estimate of the total merit order effect, i.e. the\\naverage price reduction by calculating the volume weighted average\\nprice difference over the analysis period (see Forrest and MacGill\\n(2013) for further information on the estimation strategy).\\n\\nThis represents a short run estimate of the merit order effect, as\\nit does not take into account long run changes in generation\\ncapacity due to additional wind generation. The estimate of the\\nmerit order effect in 2012–13 is higher by approximately $1/MWh.\\nThis is a result of higher wind penetration and the introduction of\\nthe carbon price leading to higher operating costs of the marginal\\ngeneration that wind displaces.5\\n\\n3.2. RET costs in regulated retail tariffs\\n\\nRetailers pass the costs incurred by purchasing Renewable Energy\\nCertiﬁcates (RECs) on to consumers in the form of higher electricity\\nprices.6 In jurisdictions where retail prices are regulated, regulators\\nhave to set a green scheme allowance for prices to be set by the\\nretailer. In order to determine the green scheme allowance, jurisdic-\\ntions apply the Renewable Power Percentage (RPP) in a given year to\\nthe expected Large-scale Generation Certiﬁcate (LGC) price. Jurisdic-\\ntions use different approaches to estimate the expected LGC price.\\nSome base their estimations on the observed prices of LGCs on the\\nmarket (Queensland, the ACT and Tasmania) while others use an\\nelectricity market model to derive the least cost option of reaching\\nRET targets (New South Wales, South Australia).\\n\\nLRET allowances for retail prices set in 2011–12 and 2012–13 in\\nthe different State and Territory jurisdictions are shown in Table 7.\\nFor New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and\\nthe ACT, allowances shown are those set by the respective\\nregulator for regulated retail tariffs. The retail electricity market\\nis deregulated in Victoria, but retailers have to publish a standing\\noffer price, which the Australian Electricity Market Commission\\n(AEMC, 2013b) uses to calculate an indicative component of LRET\\ncosts in retail prices.\\n\\nAs an indicator for LRET costs, a volume-weighted average\\nusing residential electricity consumption by State from ESAA\\n(2013) of the allowance for LRET costs in regulated retail tariffs\\n(Table 7) is calculated at 3.38 $/MWh in 2011–12 and 5.29 $/MWh\\nin 2012–13. This estimate represents LRET costs for households\\nand small business, as covered by regulated retail tariffs. It has to\\nbe noted that cost recovery in a regulated electricity tariff may\\noverstate the costs of green certiﬁcates and not represent compe-\\ntitive market prices. Indeed, some of the approaches used by NEM\\njurisdictions to determine this allowance have led to estimated\\nLRET certiﬁcate prices that are considerably higher than the\\nobserved spot market price. Therefore, LRET costs for industry\\n\\n5 While our analysis focusses on the effect of the Large-scale RET and\\nassociated wind generation, the recent rise in photovoltaic generation installed in\\nthe NEM (as a result of the SRES and State-based feed-in tariffs) is also expected to\\nhave considerable merit order effects (cf. McConnell et al., 2013, who model the\\nhypothetical impact of 5 GW of distributed photovoltaic generation installed in the\\nNEM in 2009 to 2010).\\n\\n6 Therefore, in a concentrated market like Australia, retailers generally do not\\nhave an incentive to minimise RET costs. That is why some large users would like to\\nopt into the scheme and manage their liabilities directly (Climate Change Authority,\\n2012).\\n\\n\\x0c46\\n\\nJ.

In general, higher wholesale prices should lead to\\nlower prices for renewable certiﬁcates. This is the case, because\\nthe certiﬁcate price covers the cost difference between what can\\nbe earned on the electricity market by a renewable generator\\nand what it costs to build it. However, regulator estimations for\\nrenewable certiﬁcates were increased between 2011–12 and 2012–\\n13, since alternative assumptions regarding the cost of capital\\n(WACC) were applied. This is partly due to uncertainty surrounding\\nthe political future of renewable energy policy in Australia (cf. Nelson\\net al., 2013).\\n\\nOverall, estimated merit order effects in 2011–12 and 2012–13\\nare not high enough to fully compensate every electricity con-\\nsumer for their cost contribution to the RET. However, merit order\\neffects do have the potential to signiﬁcantly reduce RET costs if\\nthey are passed forward to consumers. Note that this effect might\\nnot hold in the long run, as the effect of increased renewable\\ngeneration on wholesale electricity prices in the long run depends\\non its effect on investment and divestment decisions in the\\nelectricity industry and, more generally, future electricity market\\ndesign.\\n\\n4. Discussion\\n\\nAs stated above, the net effect of the RET on an individual\\nconsumer, i.e. their position on Table 8, is likely to depend on\\ncertain consumer characteristics. In this section we explore further\\nconsumer characteristics that inﬂuence (i) the pass-through of\\nmerit order effects and (ii) the pass-through of RET costs and the\\nrole of regulators in those jurisdictions with regulated retail prices.\\n\\n4.1. Pass-through of merit order effects\\n\\nThe pass-through of merit order effects depends on the extent\\nto which electricity prices of consumers are aligned to wholesale\\nprices. Large users typically obtain negotiated and often tailored\\ncontracts with retailers within the competitive market. These\\ntailored contracts may include signiﬁcantly longer time periods\\nthan the standard one to three year contracts for small customers\\nand can potentially include varying levels of wholesale spot price\\nexposure depending on the energy user's particular requirements,\\nrisk appetite and load curtailment opportunities. The contracts are\\noften based on forward prices. However, forward prices should\\ngenerally respond to merit order effects as well, as otherwise\\narbitrage between the two contracts would be possible (Sensfuß,\\n2011). At present, future wholesale prices are generally ﬂat or even\\nlower than current spot prices as market participants expect a\\nreduction or elimination of the carbon price.\\n\\nResidential and small business consumers, on the other hand,\\nare subject to regulated or competitive market offers from retai-\\nlers. Determinations of regulated tariffs are available online from\\nthe regulatory authority in each State. Information for contracts for\\nsmall consumers that are not on a regulated tariff is hard to obtain.\\nThe AEMC notes that unregulated contracts for small consumers\\n“will generally be lower than regulated or standing offers” (AEMC,\\n2013b p. 23).\\n\\nGenerally, two different approaches are used by regulators to\\ndetermine the wholesale component of a regulate tariff: (i) a Long\\nrun marginal cost (LRMC) approach and (ii) a market-based\\napproach. The LRMC can be modelled using a number of different\\napproaches, including the standalone approach, the average incre-\\nmental cost (AIC) approach and the perturbation (or Turvey)\\napproach. The standalone approach assumes that no generation\\ncapacity currently exists and therefore, that demand is met by\\nconstructing new generation capacity in a least cost manner to\\nmeet the demand. The standalone approach is popular amongst\\nregulators in Australia due to its relative simplicity and because it\\ncan be readily applied to different demand proﬁles. In particular,\\nits applicability to different demand proﬁles means that the LRMC\\ncan be calculated for customers for individual distribution areas\\nusing their respective load proﬁles.\\n\\nThe AIC and perturbation approach both utilise electricity\\nmarket investment models to produce estimates of the LRMC.\\nThe AIC approach estimates the LRMC by determining the average\\ncosts of meeting all future increases in demand. The AIC can be\\nvolatile or possibly undeﬁned when future demand is not strictly\\nincreasing. The perturbation approach estimates the LRMC in a\\ngiven year by ‘perturbing’ demand with a permanent increase and\\nﬁnding the average costs to meet this perturbation.\\n\\nMarket-based energy purchase costs are estimated by forecast-\\ning spot and contract prices and then estimating an effective\\nhedging strategy for the load that the respective retailers serve.\\nAlternatively, a hedging strategy can be applied to observed prices\\nin the futures market. From this the total costs of purchasing\\nelectricity are calculated as the cost of purchasing a hedged\\nposition in the market.\\n\\nThe different modelling strategies applied by the regulators in\\nNew South Wales and Queensland in 2011–12 and 2012–13 are\\nsummarised in Table 9. Generally, energy purchase cost results are\\nhigher using a standalone LRMC approach than a market-based\\napproach. One reason for this difference is that each approach to\\nestimating the LRMC implicitly incorporates the merit order effect\\nto a different extent and the extent is often driven by the\\nassumptions used in undertaking the modelling, in particular the\\ntreatment of\\nthe Renewable Energy Target. The standalone\\napproach, as it is typically applied, does not include the effect of\\nrenewable generation on price. Typical modelling using the\\nstandalone approach assumes that demand must be met by a\\nmix of coal- and gas-ﬁred generation and ignores renewable\\n\\n\\x0c48\\n\\nJ.

In their\\nreview on best practice retail price methodology, the AEMC\\n(2013a) notes that a perturbation LRMC method produces “useful\\ninsights” into the interaction between the LRET and the wholesale\\nelectricity price, while the AIC and standalone methods are less\\nlikely to do so (p.38). Since the electricity market hedging model\\nused for the market-based approach is calibrated to the NEM, it\\ndoes take into account generation by renewable energy sources\\nand therefore incorporates the impact of the merit order effect of\\nrenewable generation (e.g. Frontier Economics, 2011).7\\n\\nFig. 4 illustrates the impact different pass-through rates of the\\nmerit order effect had on indicative net effects for residential or\\nsmall business consumers in 2011–12 and 2012-13. These con-\\nsumers are expected to face full RET costs, illustrated by the top\\nbars. However, net costs can be reduced signiﬁcantly, when the\\nreduction of wholesale prices, caused by increased wind genera-\\nis passed through to consumers. Therefore, methods of\\ntion,\\ncalculating the wholesale component in regulated retail prices\\nthat are likely to capture merit order effects are expected to reduce\\n\\n7 Although both the perturbation LRMC approach and market-based methods\\nusing future prices are considered to be efﬁcient estimates of future wholesale\\nelectricity costs, estimates might diverge on a year-by-year basis (AEMC, 2013a).\\nThis may have several reasons, including assumptions made in the models, NEM\\nmarket design that encourages particular behaviour by incumbents and new\\nentrants, the fact that the RET is driving generation investment in the absence of\\nan energy market signal and ﬁnally, falling demand.\\n\\nthe overall cost of the LRET for these small consumers. If the\\nwholesale component in the regulated tariffs is not reﬂective of\\nthe actual costs of purchasing electricity on the wholesale market\\nby the retailer, this constitutes an additional proﬁt for retailers,\\nﬁnanced by regulated electricity consumers.\\n\\nGenerally,\\n\\njurisdictions have moved away from standalone\\nLRMC towards market-based approaches during the past two\\nyears (Table 10), which may be attributed to the attempt to “place\\ndownward pressure on regulated retail prices” (IPART, 2013 p. 11)\\ngiven that “[standalone] LRMC ignores prevailing conditions in the\\nelectricity market, which can be inﬂuenced by a range of factors\\nand which can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on energy purchase\\ncosts” (QCA, 2012 p. 22). Regulators use both forecast prices and\\npublicly available future or forward prices in their market-based\\nenergy purchase cost estimates, depending on how liquid they\\njudge the futures market. The AEMC (2013a) suggests that using\\nprices observed on the futures market is likely to lead to more\\nefﬁcient and transparent results and regulators acknowledge that\\n“the main beneﬁt of using market forward prices over modelled\\nforward prices is that it is more transparent” (IPART, 2013, p. 60).\\n\\n4.2. Pass-through of RET costs\\n\\nThe pass-through of RET certiﬁcate costs is likely to mainly\\ndepend on the level of exemption of the individual consumer.\\nFig. 5 shows estimated indicative effects for industry that received\\n90% exemption from RET costs in 2011–12 and 2012–13.\\n\\nIf some of the merit order effect is passed through to these\\nelectricity consumers, they are likely overcompensated for their\\ncontribution to the costs of the RET.\\nIf this contribution was\\nincreased, this would lower the cost for remaining (non-exempt)\\nconsumers. Note that the estimated average LRET costs employed in\\nthis analysis are a weighted-average of the LRET allowance in\\nregulated tariffs and may therefore be higher than the costs\\ncompanies with tailored contracts (or that buy LGCs directly on the\\nmarket) actually face. On the other hand, there may be issues with\\nretailers exerting market power towards exempt consumers and not\\ncompensating them for the whole value of the PEC (AIGN 2012).\\n\\nFor electricity consumers receiving a regulated retail tariff, the\\nregulator has to estimate a green scheme allowance. In order to do\\nso, a price forecast for LGCs needs to be made. Again, regulators\\n\\n\\x0cJ.

Conclusions and policy implications\\n\\nSince its inception in 2001, the Australian Renewable Energy\\nTarget (RET) has spurred considerable investment in renewable\\nelectricity generation. Using time-series regression, we highlight\\nthat the increasing amount of wind energy fed into the NEM has\\nplaced a considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity\\nprices through the so-called merit order effect.\\n\\nOn the other hand, costs of the RET are passed on to consumers\\nin the form of higher retail electricity prices through ‘green’\\nsurcharges imposed by retailers who are liable parties under the\\nscheme. The net impact on a particular energy user depends on a\\nnumber of factors. These include whether or not they are largely\\nexempt from paying for the cost of the RET, and the extent to\\nwhich lower wholesale electricity prices are passed through into\\nretail electricity prices paid by consumers.\\n\\nOur ﬁndings suggest that the ﬁnancial beneﬁts and costs of the\\nRET for energy consumers could potentially be more equitably\\ndistributed. While it is impossible to estimate net effects for\\nindividual consumers with certainty, our analysis points to two\\nkey policy implications (i) the potentially large ﬁnancial transfers\\nbetween energy users arising from the current level (and extent) of\\nRET exemptions for some favoured large energy-intensive indus-\\ntries and (ii) the question to what extent the, perhaps only short\\nterm, beneﬁts of the RET in putting downward pressure on whole-\\nsale prices are passed through to different energy consumer classes.\\nContrasting the estimated reduction in wholesale prices with\\nthe costs of the RET to exempt industries, suggests that some\\ncompanies might be currently signiﬁcantly overcompensated for\\ntheir contribution to the costs of the RET by the merit order effect\\nof wind, particularly those exempt from 90% of RET costs. There is\\nscope for re-examining these assistance rates in light of reduced\\nwholesale prices due to merit order effects, as a broader liability\\nbase could reduce the cost of the RET for remaining electricity\\nconsumers, and, in particular, households.\\n\\nFurthermore, when evaluating the impact of the RET on\\nelectricity prices, both its costs, but also its beneﬁts should be\\ntaken into account. At the moment the focus is on RET costs added\\nto the retail price of electricity. However, the distributional effects\\nof the RET are likely being worsened at present by regulators not\\n\\n\\x0c50\\n\\nJ. Cludius et al. / Energy Policy 71 (2014) 40–51\\n\\nadequately passing on lower spot prices through to residential\\nhouseholds and small businesses on default regulated tariffs due\\nto their various methodologies for estimating wholesale energy\\npurchase costs. If retailers passed through more of the reduction in\\nwholesale prices,\\ninduced at least in part through additional\\nrenewable generation, the overall impact of the RET on retail\\nelectricity prices could be considerably smaller.\\n\\nThere might be a case for removing the regulation of retail\\nprices in some jurisdictions. However, all consumers including\\nhouseholds and small business already have the right to opt-out of\\na regulated tariff and take up a market offer. Some States have\\nremoved default regulated tariffs entirely. However, there are\\nconcerns regarding the level of effective competition being\\nachieved within competitive retail market arrangements given\\nthe current dominant positions of three major vertically integrated\\n‘gentailers’ in the NEM. It remains to be seen whether an oligopoly\\nof retailers would show greater appetite for passing reduced\\nwholesale prices on to consumers. Therefore, the ﬁrst step could\\nbe for governments to give some guidance on how regulators\\ncould better incorporate reduced wholesale prices due to merit\\norder effects in retail tariffs, as in the AEMC report on best practice\\nretail price methodology (AEMC, 2013a).\\n\\nFinally, the distributional impacts of energy and climate policy are\\ncommonly not a primary focus of policy makers given effectiveness\\nand efﬁciency objectives. They often only come into view after the\\npolicies have been operating for some period of time. Our analysis\\nhighlights the potential value of considering distributional issues ex-\\nante when designing and implementing energy and climate policy,\\nespecially the level and scope of any exemptions offered as ‘so-called’\\ncompensation to particular parties. While there are both environ-\\nmental and economic reasons for exempting some industries from\\ncomplying with the full costs of such policies, regulators have to keep\\nin mind that any of those exemptions will generally increase the costs\\nfor the non-exempt parties. As such, the estimated distributional\\neffects are not an inherent feature of the RET or any renewable energy\\nsupport policy, but the result of design choices made when imple-\\nmenting the policy.\\n\\nThere exist other dimensions of distributional issues in relation to\\nrenewable energy policies, such as between households of different\\nincome groups (cf. Neuhoff et al., 2013) or between producers and\\nconsumers of electricity (cf. Hirth and Ueckerdt, 2013), which have not\\nbeen addressed here. Note, that our study examines short run effects\\nof renewable energy generation on the wholesale price for electricity.\\nWhether reduced wholesale prices due to renewable generation are a\\nlong term phenomenon depends on their impact on investment and\\ndivestment decisions in the industry and the future design of\\nelectricity markets. As always, further work is required to better\\nunderstand these important issues.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors would like to thank Denzil Fiebig of the School of\\nEconomics (UNSW, Australia) for helpful comments.

The only enduring policy has been\\nthe Commonwealth Renewable Energy Target (RET). Despite the relative success of\\nthe RET in driving investment and reducing emissions, state governments have now\\npivoted towards contracts-for-diﬀerence (Cfds). In this article, we outline the issues\\nassociated with policy discontinuity and the large-scale RET and review its\\neﬀectiveness as an emissions reduction tool and driver of electricity sector abatement.\\nWe ﬁnd that the RET has been relatively successful across the key criteria of cost and\\nemissions reductions and is a better policy instrument than contracts-for-diﬀerence,\\nwhich are increasingly being adopted by state governments. Building on the work of\\nNelson et al.

Introduction\\n\\nAustralia has had a haphazard approach to integration of climate change and\\nenergy policy for decades. This is despite Australia having committed to\\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions in a manner consistent with a carbon\\nbudget that would limit anthropogenic climate change to no more than two\\ndegree Celsius. The implied carbon budget for Australia to meet this\\ncommitment is a 50% reduction on 2005 emission levels by 2030 (Mein-\\nshausen et al., 2021) and achieving a 1.5 degrees outcome (which is an\\naspirational goal of all governments through the United Nations Convention\\non Climate Change: UNFCCC) would require a 75% reduction. It is worth\\nnoting that this is signiﬁcantly greater than the current Commonwealth\\nGovernment target of 26–28% by 2030. It can therefore be inferred that\\ngreater emission reduction targets in the future are likely, with international\\n\\n* The authors thank Thomas Nelson for insights on an earlier draft.\\n† Tim Nelson (email:\\n\\nis an Associate Professor at Griﬃth\\nUniversity, 17/56 Pitt Street, Sydney, New South Wales 2000, Australia.

At the state level, several policies\\nwere utilised prior to the Clean Energy Future package superseding them.\\nThese included the NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme (GGAS) and\\nthe Queensland 13% (and subsequently 18%) Gas Scheme. Importantly,\\ngovernments have tried and failed to agree on a national approach to an\\nemissions\\nintensity scheme through the National Energy Guarantee\\n(Simshauser & Tiernan, 2019).\\n\\nThe Renewable Energy Target is a renewable certiﬁcate obligation (ROC)\\nor renewable portfolio standard (RPS) style policy. Energy retailers must buy\\na set percentage (currently 20%) of their energy from renewable generators.1\\nThis is achieved by new renewable projects selling certiﬁcates (called large-\\nscale generation certiﬁcates, or LGCs) for each unit of production to retailers.\\nThis results in new investment in wind, solar and other green technologies.\\nPolicies utilising a ROC-style framework have been well studied in markets in\\nEurope and Australia (see Foxson & Pearson, 2007; Nelson, 2015; Wood &\\nDow, 2010, 2011; Woodman & Mitchell, 2011). Sioshansi (2021, p.3) notes\\nthat, ‘renewable portfolio standards have long been favoured in the United\\nStates – as opposed to Feed-in-tariﬀs or other instruments popular in\\nEurope’.\\n\\nDespite the enduring success of the RET as Australia’s only long-term\\nemissions reduction policy for the electricity sector, the lack of a compre-\\nhensive national policy approach to reducing emissions has seen state\\ngovernments continue to implement suboptimal contract-for-diﬀerence (Cfd)\\nstyle policies (Nelson & Gilmore, 2021). A Cfd is eﬀectively an agreement for\\nthe government to make up the diﬀerence between the market price for\\nelectricity and the price agreed to between the renewable generator and the\\ngovernment. The Victorian Government has utilised Cfd structures to\\nsupport new VRE investment through its VRET policy which is aimed at\\nachieving 50% renewable energy by 2030. This has been legislated in the\\nRenewable Energy (Jobs and Investment) Act 2017 (Vic). The ACT has\\nsimilarly utilised Cfd structures to achieve its goal of 100% of the territory’s\\nenergy being sourced from renewables.

However, the NSW Government has now legislated one of\\nthe world’s most ambitious policies through the NSW Energy Roadmap.\\nUnder the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020, the NSW Govern-\\nment has committed to using ‘swaptions’ or long-term energy service\\nagreements (LTSEAs) to underpin 12 GW of new renewable generation\\nacross three new Renewable Energy Zones (REZs).2\\n‘Swaptions’ are\\ncontracts where the seller has an option to take up a Cfd at some point in\\nthe future. The plan also involves the use of an underwriting mechanism to\\ndeliver ~2 GW of new ﬁrming capacity such as battery storage or pumped\\nhydro. It is therefore a critical policy juncture point to assess whether the\\nRET in a moderated form or Cfds are a superior policy choice to drive\\nrenewable investment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThe NSW Government is responding to market forecasts that over the next\\n20 years Australia’s ageing baseload coal ﬂeet will be progressively replaced\\nby 30–45 GW of additional utility scale renewable energy capacity (AEMO\\nISP, 2020, p. 12). It is anticipated that this renewable growth will be\\nfacilitated by the parallel development of 15–20 GW of ﬂexible, dispatchable,\\nfast-start ﬁrming capacity.

Literature review\\n\\nThe existing literature is heavily skewed towards analysing the use of a broad-\\nbased carbon price to reﬂect the externality cost of producing greenhouse gas\\nemissions. It is almost universally agreed that a well-designed carbon pricing\\nmechanism would be a superior policy choice for reducing emissions\\n(Freebairn, 2020). Studies examining national and international greenhouse\\ngas emissions pricing include the following: Freebairn (2012, 2014a, 2014b,\\n2018); Garnaut (2011, 2014, 2015); Holden and Dixon (2018); Quiggin et al.\\n(2014); Wood and Blowers (2016); Naughten (2013); The Climate Institute\\n(2013); Kember et al. (2013); and Clarke (2011). Many of these studies are\\nquantitative in nature and conclusions have been built upon through the use\\nof Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling. These include Adams\\n(2007), Adams and Parmenter (2013), Adams et al. (2014) and Meng et al.\\n(2013). In particular, McKibbin, Wilcoxen and their colleagues have\\npublished multiple studies since the 1990s (see, e.g., McKibbin et al., 2009,\\n2012, 2014; McKibbin & Wilcoxen, 2002a, 2002b; Pearce & McKibbin,\\n2007).4\\n\\nHowever, although the theoretical and applied literature demonstrating a\\nwell-designed emissions trading scheme should be adopted, most of the\\npolitical debate is ﬁxed on the future of coal and gas within the real economy\\nin Australia. Sadly, this completely misrepresents the real risks to the\\nAustralian economy (Nelson, 2015). Australia is one of the world’s largest\\nenergy exporters. Coal (14.8%) and gas (10.6%) comprise around one-\\nquarter of Australian exports. Australia is the largest exporter of coal with\\naround 30% of all total coal exports and has recently overtaken Qatar as the\\nworld’s largest exporter of LNG. In this context,\\nit matters little what\\nAustralian politicians think the future of gas and coal looks like. What\\nmatters are the views of Australia’s largest energy trading importers such as\\nJapan, Taiwan, China and Korea. All of these countries have committed to\\nnet zero and are shifting consumption away from Australia’s fossil fuel\\nexports. The sad outworking of this situation is that, ‘According to the 2020\\n\\n4 Both McKibbin (in general) and Nelson (2015) make the point that mitigation impacts on\\nAustralia are likely to be mostly incurred through other countries shifting their energy mix\\naway from coal and gas, two large sources of export revenue.\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

Nelson et al.\\n\\nClimate Change Performance Index, Australia was ranked as the worst-\\nperforming country on climate change policy (Ali et al., 2020)’.\\n\\n2.1 The cost of uncertainty and the ‘merit-order eﬀect’\\n\\nGiven the fraught political debate about the future of coal and gas in the\\nAustralian economy, there has been ongoing policy discontinuity in relation\\nto energy and climate change (see Simshauser & Tiernan, 2019). The costs of\\nthis ongoing policy uncertainty have been well documented in the Australian\\nliterature (see Byrnes et al., 2013; Jones, 2010, 2014; Nelson, 2015; Nelson\\net al., 2010, 2012). Many of these studies note that in a capital-intensive\\nindustry such as electricity, a lack of certainty in relation to public policy\\nresults in suboptimal capital investment (including the potential for stranded\\nasset risk in higher capacity factor gas plant). Over time, this manifests in\\nhigher than necessary electricity costs driven by a higher weighted average\\ncost of capital (WACC) and an industry preference to minimise capital at risk\\nby deploying higher operating cost technologies (see Nelson et al, 2010;\\nNelson et al, 2013).\\n\\nSimshauser and Gilmore (2020) provide a very useful overview of the ‘rate\\nof change’ problem whereby signiﬁcant additional costs have been imposed\\non the Australian economy due to Australia’s policy incoherence. Ongoing\\npolicy changes resulted in an ‘investment megacycle’ whereby ~12,000MW of\\nplant commitments comprising $20+ billion across 105 projects was squeezed\\ninto just three years (2017–2020).5 Unsurprisingly, there were signiﬁcant\\nconnection delays and major issues with system frequency operating outside\\nnormal bands, critical reductions in system strength and increasing interven-\\ntions by the market operator to keep the system secure. Instead of focusing\\non these important engineering issues, the policy debate shifted towards\\nmarket redesign proposals with a focus on future reliability and resource\\nadequacy. Sadly, very little of the debate was grounded in an understanding\\nof the problem (see Nelson et al., 2018).\\n\\n2.2 Renewable energy certiﬁcate schemes\\n\\nThe main limitation of mechanisms such as the RET is that they are not\\ntechnology neutral. While they are a better policy design than general\\nsubsidies, they overlook opportunities for abatement (e.g. energy eﬃciency)\\nbecause of their focus on new investment in production capacity (Freebairn,\\n2018). While mechanisms that subsidise new investment can lower wholesale\\nelectricity prices in the short run (assuming the absence of existing generator\\nretirements) (Bell et al., 2017), the policy can have the perverse eﬀect of\\nstimulating electricity consumption beyond eﬃcient levels (Freebairn, 2018).\\nCritically, the ‘merit-order eﬀect’ of lower prices is temporary.

Importantly, quantitative modelling\\nhas demonstrated that LRET style mechanisms have higher abatement costs\\nthan well-designed emissions tax and trading mechanisms (Buckman &\\nDiesendorf, 2010). In short, most of the literature around LRET style policies\\nﬁnds that they are inferior to a well-designed emissions trading scheme (see\\nNelson et al., 2019).\\n\\nThere are also signiﬁcant beneﬁts associated with ROC-style policies such\\nas the LRET. In the Australian context, the LRET has resulted in signiﬁcant\\nadditional investment, particularly in new wind generation (Cludius et al.,\\n2014). Bell et al. (2017) found that the LRET has lowered wholesale spot\\nprices through reductions in technology costs. Rather than the overarching\\npolicy mechanism, design ﬂaws of LRET in its implementation in a market\\nwith signiﬁcant retail and generator concentration may have contributed to\\nsuboptimal outcomes (see, e.g., Buckman & Diesendorf, 2010; Simshauser &\\nTiernan, 2019). Furthermore, the ongoing review and amendment of the\\nLRET and continuing disagreement between the Commonwealth and state\\nimpact on its cost-\\ngovernments is likely to have had a detrimental\\neﬀectiveness (see Jones, 2010, 2014).\\n\\n2.3 Contracts-for-diﬀerence schemes\\nGovernment-initiated Cfds are relatively simple in structure.7 Governments\\nhold reverse auctions for capacity and award Cfds to the winning proponents\\nof new generation. The Cfd structure generally involves a ‘strike price’, which\\nis compared to the wholesale spot price in each settlement period. Where the\\nwholesale price is lower than the strike price, the government pays the\\nproponent the diﬀerence. If the wholesale price is higher than the strike price,\\nthe generator pays the government the diﬀerence.\\n\\nWhile it is true that CfDs may reduce risks to individual project proponents\\nfrom a LRET ﬂoating LGC price (Woodman & Mitchell, 2011), Bunn and\\nYusupov (2015) demonstrate that with negative correlation between renew-\\nable output and wholesale electricity prices, LGCs reduce counterparty\\ninvestment risk when compared to Cfds or feed-in tariﬀs (FiTs).\\n\\nThere are obvious problems with utilising Cfds.

Nelson et al.\\n\\nElectricity markets are incredibly dynamic and investments need to consider\\nnot just the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) but the spatial and temporal\\ndynamics of market pricing. Building very low-cost generators with very high\\nrenewable resources in congested and weak parts of the grid has resulted in\\nvery poor outcomes in Victoria’s north-west (see Simshauser & Gilmore,\\n2020). Furthermore, it is na¨ıve to assume governments are well placed to\\ndecide which investments are likely to be economic due to the need to assess a\\nproject’s production against a dynamic market with signiﬁcant changes in\\ndemand across the day and season. In fact, one of the strengths of utilising a\\nmarket approach rather than a Cfd is that poor investments result in the\\nproject proponent (rather than the government) writing down their invest-\\nment with consumers beneﬁting.\\n\\nSimshauser (2019) notes that there are three inherent limitations associated\\n\\nwith Cfds:\\n\\n(cid:129) Government-initiated CfDs are usually awarded on simpliﬁed metrics such\\nas minimising the LCOE. As noted above, ignoring temporal and spatial\\ndynamics is likely to introduce ineﬃcient plant entry. In contrast, well-\\ndesigned renewable portfolio standards such as the LRET require investors\\nin generation to determine not just costs but the spatial and temporal\\ndynamics of the project relative to the market.\\n\\n(cid:129) Importantly, Cfds introduce a new category of ‘quasi-market’ participant\\nthat is completely removed from the market’s locational, spot and forward\\npricing signals. Over time, this results in suboptimal decision making within\\nthe dispatch of energy and increases the risks to secure and reliable system\\noperation.\\n\\n(cid:129) The use of Cfds results in these new ‘quasi-market’ participants withdraw-\\ning from primary issuance forward derivative hedge markets. Given the\\ncertainty of revenue due to the Cfd, there is little incentive for these new\\ngenerators to manage price risk using ﬁnancial derivative contracts. Over\\ntime, the government eﬀectively becomes the market. Eﬃcient pricing,\\nretail competition and innovation are likely to be stiﬂed as new participants\\nare unable to compete.\\n\\nOne of the overlooked aspects of Cfds in the Australian context is the\\nimpact of shifting policy support to an alternative mechanism despite the\\nsigniﬁcant investment made to date under a long-term enduring policy. The\\nRET has delivered over 16 GW of new investment, which is underpinned by\\nthe market value of wholesale electricity prices and LGCs. By shifting\\ntowards Cfds, governments are eﬀectively stranding investments and eﬀec-\\ntively transferring existing renewable proponent producer surplus to con-\\nsumer surplus and new entrants with the potential for issues related to\\nreﬁnancing and ‘toxic debt’ (see Nelson et al., 2013; Simshauser & Nelson,\\n2012). Our analysis and policy recommendations in subsequent sections\\nconsider ways in which Cfds could be modiﬁed to minimise these impacts.\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

Given the signiﬁcant exposure of existing debt and equity\\nparticipants to the 16 GW of projects already built under the RET (with\\nmuch of it being reﬁnanced in 2022 and 2023), project proponents will likely\\nface higher WACCs as a result of the erosion in value of their projects due to\\nthe switch from one form of policy support (RET) to another (Cfds) – see\\nSimshauser and Gilmore (2020) for further analysis on this topic.\\n\\nThe ‘merit-order eﬀect’ has been promoted as a reason for introducing\\nboth ROC and Cfd style policies. The phenomenon is well documented in the\\nacademic literature, with studies originating from around 2008. The earliest\\nstudies focused on economic impacts of introducing very low short-run\\nmarginal cost technologies such as variable renewables (Gelabert et al., 2011;\\nPirnia et al., 2011; P ¨oyry for the European Wind Energy Association, 2009;\\nSensfuss et al., 2008). Australian studies have also examined the phe-\\nnomenon. Many studies have considered the impacts on the NEM price\\nduration curve (see Bell et al., 2017; Cludius et al., 2014; Forrest & MacGill,\\n2013; MacGill, 2010) and the impact of coincident production on speciﬁc\\nprice bands.\\n\\nHowever, as Nelson et al. (2012) and Simshauser (2019) note, the merit-\\norder eﬀect is a transitory phenomenon. Prices must return to levels that\\nallow for ﬁxed and operating costs to be recovered or plant is permanently\\nwithdrawn, resulting in signiﬁcant intra- and interperiod pricing volatility\\n(see Nelson et al., 2018). This is an important observation given one of the\\npurported beneﬁts of the NSW Energy Roadmap is permanently lower\\nwholesale electricity prices.8\\n\\n2.4 Emerging literature on policy evolution\\n\\nA deﬁning feature of good public policy is the creation of a uniform value of\\nabatement. This allows for the lowest cost abatement to be pursued ﬁrst\\n(Freebairn, 2020). It is therefore worth considering whether the RET can be\\n‘evolved’ to better align with this principle by creating fungibility with other\\nforms of abatement in Australia such as Australian Carbon Credit Units\\n(ACCUs). This is something that was explored by Nelson et al. (2021) who\\nproposed tying economic value from ROC, Cfd or PFiT policies to either\\nemissions intensity or wholesale electricity prices.\\n\\nOur analysis in the proceeding sections considers this issue. In particular,\\nwe ﬁnd that the worst impacts of Cfd can be overcome if they are written\\nagainst the LGC (rather than the wholesale price). This ensures that market\\n\\n8 It is important to note the two distinct pricing outcomes. One is the result of shifting to a\\nlower cost mix of new technologies.

The sectoral\\nbreakdown of emissions is shown in Figure 1 below.\\n\\nFigure 1 shows that the stationary energy sector (including electricity)\\nproduces around half of all greenhouse emissions.

Given these dynamics, it is not surprising that the electricity sector\\nhas been the focus of policy makers through the RET and now emerging Cfd\\npolicies in the ACT, Victoria and NSW.\\n\\nFigure 2 shows the impact of electricity sector policies on generation\\noutput in the NEM over the past decade. As uncertainty around the\\ninvestment trajectory required by the RET was removed following the\\nWarburton Review in 2014 (see Nelson, 2015), an investment megacycle\\noccurred between 2017 and 2020 (recall Table 1). The share of variable\\nrenewables (VRE) climbed rapidly to around 20% in 2020. Almost all this\\ninvestment utilised LGCs as part of project economics and ﬁnancing.\\n\\nFigure 3 shows the strong correlation between the penetration of VRE and\\nelectricity sector emissions in recent years. As new renewables have entered\\nthe system, existing and ageing coal assets have been retired. In fact, around\\none-third of Australia’s coal-ﬁred power stations closed in the 2010s as a\\nconsequence of renewables entering the system (Burke et al., 2018). The\\nsubstitution of these relatively high emitting assets with renewables has\\nreduced NEM emissions by around 15%. Importantly, the contribution of\\nelectricity sectoral emission reductions to the overall Australian inventory has\\nbeen signiﬁcant. This is shown in Figure 4.\\n\\nFigure 4 demonstrates that the RET is likely to have done much of the\\nheavy lifting in relation to Australian emissions reductions.

This is a nontrivial ﬁnding. Of\\nall the policies introduced to reduce emissions (QLD 18% Gas Scheme, NSW\\nGGAS, Clean Energy Future, Emission Reduction Fund and Safeguard\\nMechanism), a single policy is arguably delivering the majority of the\\nemissions reductions that are being sustainably achieved (as noted in Figure 3\\nand supported by Nelson et al., 2018 and Simshauser, 2019).9 As a policy\\ninstrument, the RET has been very successful in reducing emissions. It is\\ncontinuing to provide the underlying policy architecture for additional\\nreductions through voluntary purchases by corporate customers and house-\\nholds (via GreenPower).10\\n\\n3.2 Pricing and economic eﬀectiveness\\n\\nElectricity pricing has been a politically charged topic in Australia following\\nthe closure of the Hazelwood power station and a rapid run up in wholesale\\nelectricity prices in 2017 and 2018. Since 2011, the general Consumer Price\\nIndex (CPI) rose by around 2% pa, while the electricity component of the\\nCPI rose by around 3.5% pa. Much of this is explained by ineﬃcient increases\\nin network spending and a rise in new entrant costs for wholesale markets.\\nSimshauser and Gilmore (2020) note that the NEM’s history of new entrant\\ncost is comprised of three separate and distinct time periods. Up until 2011,\\nthe NEM was characterised by new entrant costs of between $40/MWh and\\n$60/MWh with the dominant technology shifting from coal to gas in the mid-\\n2000s. Between 2011and 2015, the NEM new entrant cost increased further to\\nbetween $60-80/MWh for a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) as higher gas\\nprices manifested because of east-coast gas demand tripling due to the\\nemergence of LNG exports. Since 2015, the new entrant cost has approx-\\nimated $70–80/MWh as ﬁrmed wind has emerged as the technology of\\nchoice.11,12\\n\\nIt should be noted that the upward trend in new entrant cost is not simply a\\nfunction of the RET. Input fuel costs for thermal plant have increased\\nsigniﬁcantly over the past decade as both coal and gas markets became\\nincreasingly export exposed. In the case of coal, $AUD pricing increased\\n\\n9 While the RET has signiﬁcantly reduced emissions,\\n\\nit is unclear how much higher\\nemissions would have been without energy eﬃciency measures that have reduced energy\\nconsumption.\\n\\n10 As at June 2021, there are around 3 GW of new large-scale renewable projects at various\\n\\nstages of commissioning and construction.\\n\\n11 Firmed wind is eﬀectively the cost of a MWh of wind added to the cost of a $300 cap\\ncontract (which reﬂects the ﬁxed cost of a gas-turbine). In this way, the MWh of wind becomes\\n‘ﬁrmed’ by the gas turbine and is equivalent to an MWh from a high-capacity factor thermal\\nplant.\\n\\n12 Some market participants have announced Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) well\\nbelow these new entrant costs. This is due to the emergence of ‘two-step pricing’ whereby\\nparticipants allocate low returns to equity in the short to medium term with a view that\\nsigniﬁcant returns will emerge in the future due to higher pricing.

Consumers beneﬁt from market participants overbuilding\\n(and facilitating oversupply) through lower prices.13\\n\\nHowever, if the LGC revenue is removed (as shown in Table 4), then the\\ntotal number of years in which a negative economic outcome is recorded\\nincreases to 46 (out of the total 55 years). This has nontrivial implications for\\npolicy design which we will explore in further detail in the subsequent section.\\nPut simply, utilisation of policy frameworks that only utilise the wholesale\\nelectricity price are likely to create a signiﬁcant exposure for governments\\n(and taxpayers) or energy consumers due to prolonged policy-induced\\nperiods of oversupply driving the out-of-market subsidy higher. If this is not\\n\\n13 It is important to note that LGC’s may have been under long-term contract, and\\ntherefore, market prices may not be as relevant. However, it is important to note that\\nconsumers continued to pay LGC ‘market prices’ as these are referenced in customer contracts.\\nAs such, a key consideration for policy makers in the design of ROC style policies is whether\\nmarket power could be used by a small number of liable entities to extract rents from\\nconsumers.\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

A renewable resource with a\\npoor correlation to demand and price is penalised relative to a project that\\noptimises location and resource to deliver energy where and when customers\\nrequire it.\\n\\n4. Policy recommendations: integrating Cfd frameworks using the RET\\n\\nThe RET required investment in renewable energy generation equivalent to\\nthe annual production of 33 TWh by 2020. At the time of writing, this\\nobjective has been achieved. Discussion about the future of the RET has\\nlargely been muted given the focus by state governments on developing Cfd\\npolicies to deliver climate change objectives. There are two observations from\\nour analysis of the RET in the preceding Section which are worth noting in\\nthis context:\\n\\n(cid:129) Finding 1: the RET facilitated both positive and negative years of cashﬂow\\n(relative to underlying LCOE). In other words, consumers beneﬁted from\\noverinvestment through lower prices (relative to LCOE) and all project\\nproponents were required to address the risks associated with the NEM’s\\nspatial and temporal dynamics.\\n\\n(cid:129) Finding 2: Without LGC revenue, all projects would have experienced\\nnegative income (relative to LCOE) almost all of the time. This has\\nnontrivial implications for policy design. Governments could have been\\nexposed to signiﬁcant ‘out-of-the-money’ Cfd liabilities of ~$0.25 billion in\\nSouth Australia alone.15 In other words, all producers would have been\\nguaranteed to make a return on their investment: privatising proﬁts and\\nsocialising losses.\\n\\nThe policy propositions that\\n\\nthe quantities of\\nrenewables being added to the NEM through to 2030 are ﬁxed and that\\nrenewables continue to be the cheapest form of zero-emissions electricity (see\\nRai and Nelson, 2021). For completeness, we have provided quantitative\\nmodelling of Optimal Plant Mixes in 2030 for the NSW system16 in two\\n\\nfollow assume that\\n\\n14 This is particularly relevant for large energy-intensive trade exposed industry which\\ncannot be shielded from higher energy costs in the same way that they are under the RET\\n(through an LGC surrender exemption).\\n\\n15 This approximate calculation is based upon total MWh produced by wind in South\\n\\nAustralia in 2020 being exposed to the negative economic outcomes in Table 4.\\n\\n16 Our modelling is based upon the work of Berrie (1967). This model is outlined in detail in\\nNelson et al. (2013) so we do not replicate it here. Importantly, the 12 GW scenario utilises a\\nresidual demand curve based upon assumptions from AEMO’s Integrated System Plan. All\\ncosts utilised are consistent with those in Table 2.\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

Our\\nresults (presented in Appendices S1 and S2) show that the price of electricity\\nis substantially lower in the 12 GW built out case. The focus of our policy\\npropositions are therefore not related to whether it is appropriate to drive\\nabatement through VRE adoption, but consideration of superior policy\\ndesign to limit unintended consequences associated with Cfds identiﬁed in\\nSection 2.\\n\\n4.1 Policy proposition 1 – utilising the RET architecture to implement Cfd\\npolices\\n\\nState governments are adopting ambitious policies to decarbonise electricity\\ngrids between 2020 and 2030. This article provides insights into how these\\ngovernments could modify their policy frameworks to achieve these goals\\nwhile limiting the most negative impacts of Cfds. Section 2 demonstrated that\\ntwo limitations in particular require particular attention by policy makers: by\\nunderwriting projects through the wholesale price, governments eﬀectively\\nremove the need for market participants to eﬃciently locate and operate their\\nprojects to maximise value given spatial and temporal dynamics; and\\ngovernments eﬀectively underwrite all the new projects in the market.\\n\\nBoth limitations could be overcome by writing the Cfd or swaption on\\nLGCs created through the RET policy architecture. By entering into a Cfd\\n(or swaption) for the government to acquire and voluntarily surrender the\\nLGCs, market participants would still be required to locate and operate\\ntheir project eﬃciently within the wholesale electricity market to maximise\\nvalue.17 Market participants would be required to carefully consider\\nlocation (to avoid issues related to reductions in dynamic marginal loss\\nfactors: MLFs) and forward hedging of output to minimise exposure to\\nvolatile spot pricing. Consumers would beneﬁt from increased liquidity and\\ntransparency in the short-term and lower sustainable prices in the long-term\\nas more eﬃcient projects are built and market participants (rather than\\ngovernments and/or consumers) face the risk of lower returns due to poor\\nproject performance.\\n\\nThe ‘spread’ of potential price outcomes for LGCs is likely to be lower than\\nwholesale electricity prices. Assuming current forward market pricing (see\\nAppendix S3), governments could sell put rights to LGCs for a strike of ~$20/\\nLGC.

Nelson et al.\\n\\n4.2 Policy proposition 2 – Carbon fungibility and development of ‘green\\nhydrogen’\\n\\nAnother key consideration of policymakers in relation to the future of the\\nRET is its alignment or ‘fungibility’ with other carbon reduction instruments\\nin Australia. While LGCs surrendered for compliance purposes under the\\nRET are obviously not ‘additional’, all other LGCs are reducing emissions\\nbeyond legislated targets. Substitution of existing emissions\\nintensive\\ngeneration with new renewables will only occur if: voluntary action is taken\\nto purchase renewable energy beyond what it is required by the market;\\ngovernments mandate new additional VRE investment through Cfds or\\n‘swaptions’; and/or existing thermal generation is retired at its end-of-life and\\nnew renewables investment occurs to ﬁll the gap created by generator exit.\\n\\nThe ﬁrst two scenarios described above are clearly additional. Additional\\nabatement is occurring because of voluntary market activity over and above\\nwhat would occur through business-as-usual. It is therefore worth consid-\\nering how governments create ‘fungibility’ between the greenhouse abatement\\nfacilitated as a result of LGC creation and other sectors where the Australian\\nCarbon Credit Unit (ACCU) represents one tonne of abatement.21\\n\\nTo create ‘fungibility’,\\n\\nit is ﬁrst necessary to deﬁne an exchange rate\\nbetween LGCs (which represent 1 MWh of renewable energy production) and\\nan ACCU (which represent 1 tonne of greenhouse abatement). This is\\nachieved through converting LGCs into ACCUs through measuring the\\ntonnes of abatement per MWh of renewable electricity generated and\\nconsumed. Nelson et al (2021) proposed that exchange rates could be based\\nupon the average emissions intensity (EI) or the marginal emissions intensity\\nat a point in time (such as each half hour of settlement within the NEM) or\\nover a year.\\n\\nTo consider the most appropriate exchange rate, we have calculated the\\naverage emissions intensity by half hour period, the average marginal\\nintensity of emissions by half hour period, the average and marginal\\nintensities across the entire year, and the wholesale electricity price by half\\nhour. We utilised 2019 data and calculated these metrics for New South\\nWales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. We have not considered\\ntransmission ﬂows. For example, NSW does not ‘import’ brown coal\\nemissions from Victoria. Our calculations for marginal emissions are based\\non the emissions intensity of the marginal price setter(s) from AEMO’s\\nNEMDE dispatch engine. In other words, the emissions intensity of the unit\\n\\n21 An ACCU is a unit issued to a person by the Clean Energy Regulator (Regulator) by\\nmaking an entry for the unit in an account kept by the person in the electronic Australian\\nNational Registry of Emissions Units (Registry). One ACCU represents one tonne of\\nabatement. The predominant buyer of ACCUs is currently the Commonwealth Government\\nthrough the Emissions Reduction Fund, although voluntary demand for ACCUs to oﬀset\\nemissions is growing.\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

During periods of low\\nprices, coal units are typically setting the price. If renewable generators\\nproduce at times of higher market prices, they are oﬀsetting a generator that,\\non average, is almost half as emissions intensive (i.e. a blend of gas and\\nhydro). Given the diurnal nature of electricity markets, marginal emissions\\nare low during the evening peak and higher overnight.\\n\\nAnother key observation is that marginal emissions are similar in all\\nregions (as the NEM is often unconstrained, with similar price setters across\\nall regions), but average emissions vary signiﬁcantly by state (due to the\\ndiﬀerent composition of generation). In particular, the average is lower in\\nSouth Australia, which has the highest penetration of large- and small-scale\\nvariable renewable generation. Importantly, average emissions do not change\\nsigniﬁcantly throughout the day22, but follow similar trends.\\n\\nWe recommend that policy makers set LGC/ACCU exchange rate\\nfundamentals using the average annual emissions intensity of the entire\\n\\n22 The relatively constant temporal average emissions are due to the dominance of coal and\\nrenewable generation for energy with gas being relied upon for capacity (and a correspondingly\\nlow capacity factor).\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

The only way marginal emissions intensities could be used in a\\nmeaningful way would be through dynamic marginal emissions pricing (i.e.\\nLGC conversion rates that vary every half hour). In practice, this would be\\nincredibly diﬃcult and administratively burdensome. Alternatively, average\\nemission intensity provides an accurate outcome when considered across the\\nentire market (recall Figure 3). As the NEM will increasingly be intercon-\\nnected through transmission built out under the Integrated System Plan\\n(ISP),\\nit is increasingly certain that generation in any state will reduce\\nemissions across the NEM.\\n\\nBy utilising LGCs when issuing Cfds or ‘swaptions’, creating fungibility\\nbetween LGCs and ACCUs and utilising LGCs as a means of guaranteeing\\nthe origin of ‘green hydrogen’ (see Appendix S4), Australian policymakers\\nwould have eﬀectively facilitated a nationally consistent and integrated\\nenergy and climate policy (without purposely seeking to do so). Market\\nparticipants would continue to be able to invest with conﬁdence in new\\nsupply and governments would be less exposed to growing out-of-market\\nobligations to ﬁnance poor projects. International investors would be able to\\npurchase quality Australian carbon units with signiﬁcant stimulus to the\\nAustralian economy.\\n\\n5. Concluding remarks\\n\\nto force this outcome. Firstly,\\n\\nFreebairn (2020) provides a useful overview of how to consider a package of\\ngreenhouse abatement policies. While he argues a national emissions price is\\nthe most eﬃcient policy tool, it is unlikely to be the only policy required. Two\\ninstitutional barriers,\\nconstraints exist\\ntransaction costs and other nonprice barriers will exist that mute pricing\\nsignals. Energy eﬃciency standards for new appliances are a good example of\\nthis ﬁrst barrier. The second constraint relates to the real political economy\\nand public resistance to emissions trading and ‘carbon taxes’. In the\\nAustralian context, the second constraint is likely to be more pervasive,\\nalthough this may change due to the emergence of border adjustment taxes\\nthat are being developed by major trading partners such as the European\\nUnion.\\n\\nClimate policy will therefore need to evolve in a way that maximises\\neconomic eﬃciency but is able to be enduring given political realities. In the\\nAustralian context, it is worth considering recent community polling, which\\nindicates that 55 per cent of all voters agree with reducing emissions to ‘net\\nzero’ by 2050 with 33 per cent undecided. At the same time, the proportion of\\nvoters that believe the target should be met through increased deployment of\\nrenewable energy is 61 per cent.23 As such, there is considerable merit in\\n\\n23 Polling available at: https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/voters-want-australia-to-\\nAccessed\\n\\nset-a-net-zero-2050-emissions-target-but-no-carbon-tax-20210615-p5813w.html,\\nonline on 19 June 2021.\\n\\n© 2021 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\\n\\n 14678489, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12457 by <Shibboleth>-member@swin.edu.au, Wiley Online Library on [21/09/2024].

The RET has\\nbeen the primary policy tool for reducing emissions within Australia. In\\nrelation to its impact on electricity markets and consumers, we make two key\\nﬁndings:\\n\\n(cid:129) Finding 1: The RET facilitated both positive and negative years of cashﬂow\\n(relative to underlying LCOE). In other words, consumers beneﬁted from\\noverinvestment through lower prices (relative to LCOE) and all project\\nproponents were required to address the risks associated with the NEM’s\\nspatial and temporal dynamics.\\n\\n(cid:129) Finding 2: Without LGC revenue, all renewable projects would have\\nexperienced negative income (relative to LCOE) almost all the time. This\\nhas nontrivial implications for policy design. Governments or consumers\\ncould have been exposed to signiﬁcant ‘out of the money’ Cfd liabilities. In\\nother words, all producers would have been guaranteed to make a return\\non their investment: privatising proﬁts and socialising losses.\\n\\nGiven state governments are pivoting towards Cfd auctions to facilitate\\nnew renewable investment, our policy recommendations relate to integrating\\nthe beneﬁts of the RET and LGC framework within these auction processes.\\nBy writing the Cfd or swaption on the LGC, rather than the wholesale\\nelectricity price, policy makers could overcome the worst aspects of Cfds.\\nMost importantly, new projects would continue to be exposed to dynamic\\nspatial and temporal pricing signals and project proponents (rather than\\ngovernments or consumers) would wear the risk of underperformance of their\\ninvestment.\\n\\nA further beneﬁt of utilising the existing LGC framework is the integration\\nof electricity sector abatement within a broader trend of corporates\\nvoluntarily reducing emissions.25 This article has analysed half hourly\\nmarginal, average and annualised marginal and average emissions intensities\\n\\n24 While economists would contend that a technologically neutral policy would be more\\neﬃcient, almost all energy economists, market participants and the peak body in Australia\\nhave publicly stated that renewables are now the cheapest form of energy.

This energy providence has sustained Australian\\neconomic growth for much of the last century. However, as Jarvinen\\net al. (2012, p.63) observed, Australian policy derivation is often\\n‘policy taking’ rather than ‘policy making’ due to the relatively small\\nsize of Australia in terms of population, technology origination and\\nglobal inﬂuence. To that end, Australia has been one of 96 countries\\nthat have embraced government policies designed to facilitate\\ngreater investment in renewable energy technologies (BNEF, 2012)\\nfuel energy\\ndespite the advantage of abundant low-cost fossil\\nreserves. Globally, concerns about energy security have motivated\\npolicymakers to introduce mechanisms designed to deploy renew-\\nable energy. Within Australia, it would be reasonable to state that the\\n\\n☆Any errors or omissions remain entirely the responsibility of the authors.\\nn Corresponding author.

This is in addition to market failures\\nassociated with sub-optimal, inter-temporal, investment allocation\\ngiven the long-lived nature of electricity infrastructure, and a\\nbipartisan agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over\\nthe long-term.\\n\\nIn 2011, approximately 90% of all electricity generated in\\nAustralia was fuelled by either coal or gas (ESAA, 2012). The\\nremaining 10% was sourced from renewables with hydro-electric\\ngeneration producing around 7% and wind contributing around 3%\\n(ESAA, 2012). This result is different when compared to ten years\\nago.\\nIn 2000, coal and gas collectively powered 92% of all\\nelectricity generation in Australia with hydro-electricity compris-\\ning the remaining 8% (ESAA, 2000). Wind was almost non-existent\\nas a deployed technology within the Australian electricity market.\\nThe critical difference between the years 2000 and 2011 was the\\noperation of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET).\\n\\nThe MRET was introduced in 2001 by the Commonwealth\\nGovernment with a public policy objective of increasing Australia's\\n\\n\\x0cT. Nelson et al. / Energy Policy 62 (2013) 386–400\\n\\n387\\n\\nrenewable electricity generation by an ‘additional 2%’. It became\\nknown as the ‘2% MRET’ policy and was successful in achieving its\\npublic policy objective: the deployment of more renewable energy.\\nHowever, there have been several policy development ‘junctures’\\nwhere investor conﬁdence has been damaged due to ongoing\\nreviews and amendment of this policy. Since the passage of the\\nlegislation underpinning the original MRET policy, there have been\\ntwo major amendments and ﬁve points of ‘review’ by policy-\\nmakers. While one of these amendments could be thought of as\\nbeing unambiguously material – the expansion of the policy from\\n2% to 20% – the remaining reviews contributed little towards\\nproviding a stable platform for investors to make long-term\\ndecisions regarding renewable energy infrastructure. For a more\\ncomprehensive outline of the history of Australia's renewable\\nenergy policy see Nelson et al. (2011).\\n\\nIn addition to consistent uncertainty in relation to Australian\\nrenewable energy policy, there has been the added uncertainty\\ncreated by the intense debate around climate change policy within\\nAustralia. A thorough explanation of the history of Australian\\nclimate change policy is provided by Nelson et al. (2012). Most\\nrecently, on 1 July 2012, the Commonwealth Government intro-\\nduced a ﬁxed carbon price or carbon tax of $23 per tonne of carbon\\ndioxide equivalent (CO2e) which will apply to all\\nindustrial\\nfacilities with emissions greater than 25,000 tonnes of CO2e. It is\\nintended that the ﬁxed price (which increases each year) will\\napply for three years with an emissions trading scheme to\\ncommence operation from 2015. This policy mechanism is\\ndesigned to deliver on the Government's policy objective –\\nreducing Australia's 2020 greenhouse gas emissions by 5% relative\\nto 2000 levels. However, while the objective is shared by the\\nopposition (Liberal/National Coalition), the mechanism by which\\nto achieve the target is not. The opposition has committed to\\nrepealing the carbon price legislation if elected to form Govern-\\nment and will then implement a ‘direct action’\\nframework.\\nAccordingly, policy uncertainty exists in relation to the longevity\\nof carbon pricing in Australia.\\n\\nThe impact of carbon policy uncertainty has been quantiﬁed in\\ntwo aspects by Australian economists (a) suboptimal investment\\ndecisions, and (b) suboptimal\\ninvestment costs relative to a\\ncounterfactual scenario. Nelson et al. (2010) examined the costs\\ninvestment caused by\\nassociated with the sub-optimal capital\\ncarbon policy uncertainty. They found that the costs could be as\\nhigh as $2 billion per annum due to unnecessarily high electricity\\nprices. This research was tested by other economic modeling ﬁrms\\nand while the thesis was found to be correct, cost estimates varied.\\nNelson, Simshauser, Orton and Kelley (2011) provide a summary of\\nthese studies so we do not intend to replicate such analysis here.\\nOn suboptimal investment costs, Simshauser and Nelson (2012)\\nestimated the capital market efﬁciency losses associated with\\ncarbon policy uncertainty. Their project ﬁnance market survey\\nestablished that providers of debt ﬁnance would impose higher\\nrisk premiums as a result of ongoing policy uncertainty in relation\\nto carbon pricing. The higher risk premiums would result in capital\\nmarket efﬁciency losses of up to $4.5 billion over the period\\nbetween 2015 and 2020.\\n\\nIt is in this context that this article considers approaches to\\nrenewable energy public policy development in Australia, applying\\nthe same methodology utilised by Simshauser and Nelson (2012)\\nto assess the capital market efﬁciency losses associated with\\nuncertainty in relation to the LRET. It is important to note that\\nthis article is not intended to discuss the merits or otherwise of\\nrenewable energy policy. This has been debated at length in the\\nAustralian and international context (for example, see SKM-MMA,\\n2012). Rather, our analysis takes as given a renewable energy\\npolicy in place for 11 years with legislated targets for the following\\n18 years.\\n\\nThis article is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the\\nevolution of large scale renewable energy policy in Australia and\\nassociated global market developments; the supply and demand\\nfor Large Scale Generation Certiﬁcates (LGCs) is presented in\\nSection 3; the results of a survey of renewable electricity market\\nparticipant views in relation to policy and pricing are documented\\nin Section 4; Section 5 analyses the capital market efﬁciency losses\\nassociated with higher risk premiums being applied to new\\ndevelopments; partial equilibrium analysis of electricity price\\nimpacts related to ongoing policy uncertainty is presented in\\nSection 6; our policy recommendations are presented in Section\\n7 with concluding remarks provided subsequently.\\n\\n2. The evolution of large-scale renewable energy policy in\\nAustralia\\n\\nThe Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) was intro-\\nduced in Australia in 2001. The legislation underpinning the policy\\nwas passed in 2000. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000\\nand Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2001 required elec-\\ntricity retailers to purchase Renewable Energy Certiﬁcates (RECs)\\nto avoid paying a shortfall penalty of $40 per megawatt hour\\n(MWh) of renewable energy not acquired. Under MRET, new\\nrenewable electricity generators constructed after 1997, and\\nincumbent renewable generators who generated power above\\ntheir historical baseline, were eligible to create RECs with one\\nREC equivalent to the generation of one MWh of renewable\\nenergy. The legislation required retailers to progressively increase\\ntheir purchases of RECs so that by the year 2010, an additional\\n9500 MWh of new renewable generation would be produced. It\\nwas forecast that the policy would add renewable generation\\noutput equivalent to around two percent of electricity demand by\\n2010. It could be argued that the policy was effective in achieving\\nits objectives over its ﬁrst few years of existence as signiﬁcant new\\ninvestments in renewable energy capacity were made in biomass,\\nlandﬁll gas and wind farms. Fig. 1 shows the new installed\\nrenewable capacity (wind and non-wind) since 2001. This is in\\naddition to the roughly 1.5 GW of small scale solar PV installed\\nbetween 2001 and 2011.\\n\\nIn 2003, a review of the MRET legislation was initiated by the\\nHoward Government and conducted by a panel chaired by former\\nSenator Grant Tambling. The review came to be known as the\\n‘Tambling Review’ and heard from interested stakeholders about\\nthe operation of the MRET since its inception in 2001. Recommen-\\ndations from the review included: the MRET measure to continue\\nto operate; MRET targets to continue to be expressed in GWh and\\nnot as a percentage of overall electricity demand; MRET targets to\\nincrease beyond 2010 and to stabilise at 20,000 GWh in 2020; and\\nthe end date of the measure to be extended beyond 2020 so that\\nrenewable energy projects receive RECs for a full 15 year period\\npresumably because such a tenor would align more closely to\\nproject ﬁnancings (Australian Greenhouse Ofﬁce, 2004).\\n\\nThe Tambling Review provided its report to the Minister for the\\nEnvironment and Heritage in late 2003, which was tabled in\\nParliament in early 2004. The Commonwealth Government made\\na number of minor changes to the policy as a result of the\\nTambling Review but the signiﬁcant recommendations outlined\\nabove were largely ignored (Australian Greenhouse Ofﬁce, 2004).\\nWhen considered in the context of global renewable energy policy,\\nthis is not surprising. Renewable energy investment at the time\\nwas relatively small by comparison to investment in thermal\\ncoal-ﬁred and gas-ﬁred power generation. This is shown in\\nFig. 2. Global renewable energy investment (LHS) and the ratio\\nof global thermal to renewable investment (RHS) are plotted for\\nthe years 2004 through 2011. In 2004, when the Commonwealth\\n\\n\\x0c388\\n\\nT. Nelson et al. / Energy Policy 62 (2013) 386–400\\n\\nFig. 1.

Global investment in renewable energy.\\nSource: Adapted from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (2012).\\n\\nGovernment largely rejected many of the recommendations of the\\nTambling Review, investment in new thermal electricity genera-\\ntion was around 3.5 times greater than investment in new renew-\\nable electricity capacity.\\n\\nFig. 2 shows that between 2004 and 2007 there was a rapid\\nrun-up in global renewable energy investment and a signiﬁcant\\ndecline in the ratio of thermal to renewable investment. This\\ncoincides with a rising number of countries around the globe\\nintroducing renewable energy targets. While the Commonwealth\\nGovernment had ruled out increasing the MRET, various state\\ngovernments initiated their own policy frameworks designed to\\nsupport the uptake of renewable energy. In 2006, the Victorian\\nGovernment legislated the Victorian Renewable Energy Target\\n(VRET) and the New South Wales Government developed (but\\ndid not legislate) the New South Wales Renewable Energy Target\\n(NRET). Both policies were effectively duplicates of the MRET\\npolicy with higher targets, whereby a liability was placed on\\nretailers incentivising the development of new renewable energy\\nthrough tradable certiﬁcation.\\n\\nThe 2007 Commonwealth election saw both major political\\nparties put ambitious clean energy policies to the electorate. The\\nincumbent Howard Government outlined an expansion of the\\nMRET to achieve 15% ‘clean’ energy production by 2020.\\nIn\\naddition to expanding the targets under the MRET, the eligibility\\ncriteria was to be amended to allow ‘effectively zero emission’\\ntechnologies such as coal and gas generation with carbon capture\\nand storage. The Rudd Opposition proposed an expansion of the\\nMRET targets to achieve 20% renewable energy production by\\n2020. Regardless, both the incumbent Government and the Oppo-\\nsition pledged to introduce emissions trading and expand renew-\\nable energy policies. However, a key point that was noted by all\\nmarket participants was the broad-based bipartisan agreement\\nrelated to anthropogenic climate change and renewable energy\\npolicies.\\n\\nPolicy certainty did not occur immediately. The Rudd Govern-\\nment took almost two years to legislate a relatively simple set of\\namendments required to give effect to the expanded 20% Renew-\\nable Energy Target, lifting the ﬁxed energy target signiﬁcantly\\n\\n\\x0cT.

The most notable of these\\nwas the Solar Credits Multiplier. While small-scale solar PV\\ngeneration (residential solar) had historically been able to create\\nRECs for ﬁfteen years of generation upfront (known as ‘deeming’),\\nthe Solar Credits Multiplier allowed installers of small scale solar\\nPV to create ﬁve times the number of these certiﬁcates. In effect,\\nresidential solar PV was receiving 75 years worth of certiﬁcates\\nimmediately while all other generation types (e.g.\\nlarge-scale\\nbiomass, solar, landﬁll gas and wind) only created RECs as the\\nactual energy was generated.\\n\\nAt the same time, premium feed-in tariffs for small-scale solar\\nPV units were being introduced by most Australian state govern-\\nments. Table 1 outlines the premium feed-in tariff policies that\\nwere in place in 2010 in each jurisdiction. With the introduction of\\nthe Solar Credits Multiplier and the various premium feed-in tariff\\npolicies, the payback for installing small-scale solar PV was\\nbetween 2 and 9 years. With such attractive investment returns,\\ninstallation of small-scale solar PV systems signiﬁcantly increased.\\nThe result of these distortions was an effective ‘crowding out’ of\\nother renewable energy technology options within the RET and an\\nassociated slump in prices due to the material oversupply of RECs.\\nFig. 3 shows the annual creation of RECs by generation type\\nsince 2005 (LHS). Note in 2010 that the actual target under the\\nMRET policy had a demand of 9.5 million certiﬁcates but about 40\\nmillion were actually created/supplied, primarily through the\\ndistortionary effects of the Solar Credits Multiplier, or ‘phantom\\nRECs’ as they became known. The combination of the Solar Credits\\nMultiplier and state-based premium feed-in tariff policies resulted\\nin approximately 500 MW of new installed residential solar PV\\ncapacity over the same period (RHS). The RET policy framework\\nwas not incentivising new renewable energy development other\\nthan residential solar PV, but the annual production of renewable\\nenergy was only 1/75 of the certiﬁcates created because, as noted\\nearlier, the 15-year output from such units is deemed up-front,\\nand was then multiplied ﬁve times over. Unsurprisingly, REC prices\\nplunged from around $50 in April 2009 to just $28 per REC in late-\\n2009 as Fig. 4 later reveals. With wholesale electricity prices in the\\nvarious National Electricity Market\\nregions in 2009\\nbetween $33/MWh and $55/MWh, combined revenue from whole-\\nsale and REC pricing was well short of the roughly $120/MWh\\nrequired to bank a new wind farm project at that time.\\n\\n(NEM)\\n\\nIn late-2009 and early-2010, there were a number of vocal critics of\\nthe newly designed RET. The signiﬁcant disquiet from large-scale\\nrenewable energy producers about the unintended consequences of\\nthe Solar Credits Multiplier and complementary premium feed-in\\ntariff policies resulted in the Government (with Opposition support)\\nannouncing fundamental changes to the operation of the policy.\\n\\n1 Following passage of the amendments giving effect to the expansion of the\\n\\nMRET, the policy became known as the Renewable Energy Target (RET).\\n\\nIn February 2010, the Commonwealth Government announced that\\nthe RET would be split into two new policies: the Large-Scale\\nRenewable Energy Target (LRET) and the Small-Scale Renewable\\nEnergy Scheme (SRES). The LRET would operate in the same way that\\nthe RET and its predecessor MRET had operated – ﬁxed GWh targets\\napplied to liable entities with Large-Scale Generation Certiﬁcates\\n(LGCs) replacing RECs as the certiﬁcate eligible to be traded. However,\\nonly large-scale generation would be eligible to create LGCs for the\\n41,000 GWh target in 2020. The SRES would allow installers of small-\\nscale renewable generation (i.e. solar PV units) to create ﬁxed price\\n$40/MWh certiﬁcates for their deemed abatement with liable entities\\n(electricity retailers) required to purchase them at rates prescribed by\\nthe independent regulator.\\n\\nThese changes were legislated in June 2010. One of the amend-\\nments negotiated during the legislative review process related to\\nongoing ‘statutory review’ of the policy. Section 162 of the Renew-\\nable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (the legislation underpinning the\\nLRET and SRES) requires an independent statutory review to be\\nconducted every two years and presented to Parliament. The ﬁrst of\\nthese reviews was conducted by the newly established Climate\\nChange Authority and completed on 19 December 2012. Perhaps\\nunsurprisingly, and indeed ironically, 12 months prior to this\\ncurrent review, the market essentially closed down for business\\ndue to low certiﬁcate prices and heightened uncertainty that\\nprevailed due to the review itself. The consequences for market\\npricing of renewable energy are highlighted in Fig. 4.\\n\\nFig. 4 shows the prices of LGCs (formerly RECs) from 2003 to\\n2012 (LHS). Also shown is the average revenue that would have\\nbeen earned by a large scale renewable energy generator from\\nLGCs and the average wholesale energy price in South Australia in\\nthat year. It should be noted that the long-run marginal cost\\n(LRMC) of the most economic renewable technology (wind) is\\ncurrently about $90–$100 per MWh. Two things are clear from this\\ngraph. First, the market for LGCs responds signiﬁcantly to move-\\nments in government policy. Three examples are highlighted:\\n(a) the rapid run up in LGC prices in 2007 as a result of an election\\nin which political parties were effectively seeking to ‘out-bid’ each\\nother in relation to support for renewable energy policy; (b) the\\nsigniﬁcant fall in prices in 2009 as the combination of the Solar\\nCredits Multiplier and premium feed-in tariffs resulted in signiﬁ-\\ncant oversupply of certiﬁcates; and (c) the fall in prices in 2010\\nassociated with emerging knowledge of the extent of the over-\\nsupply of RECs that would be carried into the LGC market. And\\nsecond, relative policy certainty is required for the combined LGC\\nand wholesale market revenue to equal or exceed the LRMC of\\ndeveloping renewable energy in Australia.\\n\\nThe review of policy history in this section highlights the\\nparticularly volatile nature of large-scale renewable energy policy\\ndevelopment since 2001 within Australia. Speciﬁcally, the original\\nMRET legislation has been materially amended twice in ten years\\nand reviewed publicly by policymakers on at least four occasions.\\nThe logical question that follows is whether investor and market\\nparticipant perceptions of the market have been skewed towards\\nexpecting further legislative or regulatory change.\\n\\n3. Supply and demand for large scale generation certiﬁcates\\n\\nEconomic theory dictates that the price of an LGC today should\\nreﬂect the difference between the wholesale electricity price and\\nthe long-run marginal cost of the most economic renewable\\nenergy project at the point of time where new renewable genera-\\ntion is required due to LGC supply falling short of demand\\n(discounted to current prices). Accordingly, we have constructed\\na simple model of LGC supply and demand to test whether the\\nprice today reﬂects the underlying fundamentals of the market.\\n\\n\\x0c390\\n\\nT.

LGC (formerly REC) price and total renewable revenue.\\nSource: ICAP, AEMO.\\n\\nThe demand and supply for LGCs in our model in any year (y) is\\ncalculated using Eq. (3.1) (demand) and Eq. (3.2) (supply)\\n\\nDLGC ¼ DRET þ DGP þ DV\\n\\nð3:1Þ\\n\\nwhere DRET is equal to legislated targets under the Renewable\\nEnergy (Electricity) Act in year (y); DP is equal to yearly demand for\\nGreen Power (projected forward unchanged)2; and DV is equal to\\nyearly demand for other renewable energy (e.g. known large\\ncontracts).3\\n\\nSLGC ¼ SCS þ SW þ SH þ SO þ SNW\\n\\nð3:2Þ\\n\\nwhere SCS is equal to the cumulative surplus of LGCs carried\\nforward from y (cid:3) 14 ; SW is equal to the annual supply produced by\\nexisting wind turbines; SH is equal to the annual supply produced\\nby existing hydro generators; SO is equal to the annual supply\\nproduced by other existing renewable generators; and SNW is equal\\nto the annual supply produced by wind turbines under construc-\\ntion today.\\n\\nBalancing Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) in each year (y) produces either a\\nsurplus of LGCs carried forward to y+1 as cumulative surplus or a\\ndeﬁcit carried forward as new supply required. At the beginning of\\nthe modeling period (2012), we have assumed a cumulative\\nsurplus of 32 million LGCs. This is based upon the surplus of\\ncertiﬁcates available at the end of the 2011 compliance period.\\n\\n2 Data sourced from reports available from: www.greenpower.gov.au.\\n3 Data based upon knowledge of voluntary industry contract purchases of new\\n\\nrenewable energy.\\n\\n4 Data for existing generators sourced from REC registry – www.rec-registry.\\n\\ngov.au.

Modeled supply and demand of LGCs from 2012 to 2020.\\n\\nFig. 5 shows the results of our modeling of the supply and\\ndemand of LGCs from 2012 to 2020. The signiﬁcant existing\\nsurplus of LGCs in 2012 is gradually absorbed by increasing\\ndemand despite a small amount of new supply through commis-\\nsioning of projects currently under construction. However, new\\nsupply (from new projects not yet under construction) is not\\nrequired until 2015. Beyond 2015, the signiﬁcant increase in\\nlegislated targets under LRET results in rapidly increasing new\\nbuild requirements. By 2020, an additional 32 million certiﬁcates\\nare required to be produced each year to ensure compliance with\\nthe scheme. This is the equivalent of approximately 9000 MW of\\nnew renewable energy capacity (assuming 35–40% capacity factors\\nand median output from existing ﬂeet of renewable plant). Over\\nthe 6 years between 2015 and 2020 (inclusive), implied annual\\nnew investment is therefore around 1500 MW or $3.3 billion\\nassuming an ‘all-in’ overnight capital cost of $2200/kW for new\\nwind (ANZ, 2011).\\n\\nOur modeling has shown that new renewable generation is\\nrequired in 2015. Based upon this observation, we are now able to\\ncalculate the implied LGC price today. As outlined earlier, the price\\nof an LGC certiﬁcate today should reﬂect the difference between\\nthe wholesale electricity price and the LRMC of the most economic\\nrenewable energy project in 2015 (discounted). Based upon a wind\\nLRMC of $99/MWh5 (inﬂated by 2.5% to account for inﬂation and\\nexpressed in 2015 dollars)6 and a 2015 forward electricity contract\\nprice (PE) of $55/MWh,7 we can use Eq. (3.3) to solve the efﬁcient\\nLGC price.\\nLRMC ¼ PLGC þ PE\\n$107/MWh¼PLGC+$55/MWh, PLGC¼$52 per certiﬁcate (2015 dollars).\\nDiscounting this price using a discount rate for the ‘cost of\\ncarry’ for the three years between 2015 and 2012 is inherently\\ndifﬁcult given the number of diverse participants in the market\\n\\nð3:3Þ\\n\\n5 We have based our estimate of the LRMC of wind utilising project ﬁnancing\\nresults from a subsequent section within this article. The estimate would be at the\\nlow conservative end of a spread of low, medium and high estimates.\\n\\n6 It is reasonable to utilise current capital costs for wind given that a two year\\nconstruction timeframe would require ﬁnancial close for new projects to be\\ncompleted in 2013 (less than a year from the time of writing) to ensure that the\\nshortfall of LGCs in 2015 is met. Wind is currently the most economic large-scale\\nrenewable energy opportunity in Australia.\\n\\n7 Obtained from d-cyphatrade on 18 June 2012–2015 base future for NSW.\\n\\nwith varying costs of ﬁnance.8 Accordingly, we have used a 7–10%\\ndiscount rate range to determine that the efﬁcient price of LGC\\ncertiﬁcates in 2012 is in the range of $39 to $42. This can be\\ncontrasted with the price of LGC certiﬁcates being $36 at the time\\nof this calculation. Based upon this analysis, it would appear that\\nLGC market participants either: disagree with the fundamentals\\npresented in this paper; or they believe the market structure is\\nlikely to be changed through further legislative or regulatory\\nchange, thereby diminishing LGC value. In our view prices are\\nwell below those implied by market fundamentals. The efﬁcient\\nprice (based upon market fundamentals and assuming perfect\\ninformation) is 8–17% higher than the actual market price depend-\\nit is\\ning upon the discount rate used. Given this disparity,\\nnecessary to consider why market participants are not acting on\\nthis clear arbitrage opportunity and increasing demand for LGCs to\\nreﬂect the economic disparity between actual and our estimate of\\nefﬁcient pricing. Our hypothesis is that the continuing review and\\nchange to the large-scale renewable energy policy outlined in\\nSection 2 has led to a belief among market participants that, in\\naggregate, ongoing policy changes will occur and thus any appar-\\nent arbitrage opportunity may well be nothing more than ‘a\\nmirage’. Accordingly, prices have and will continue to trade at a\\ndiscount to the ‘efﬁcient’ price because investors must, based on\\nhistorical experience, wait to see the government response to the\\nlegislative review by the Climate Change Authority before they\\ncommit scarce debt and equity capital to meet the underlying\\npolicy objective function.\\n\\n4. Market participant views on the LGC market\\n\\nTo suggest that a genuine price arbitrage exists, is well known\\nbut is not being cleared by a market of buyers and sellers requires\\nmore than a casual observation to be credible.

Banks, merchant generators, retailers, vertically inte-\\ngrated utilities and individual investors are all holders of LGCs. Accordingly, we\\nhave used a discount rate range (7–10%) to reﬂect the full range of ﬁnance costs\\nthat these participants may face.\\n\\n\\x0c392\\n\\nT.

Two sets of\\nmarket participants were invited to participate in the survey: (1)\\nlarge-scale renewable energy developers and the buyers of the\\ncertiﬁcates (i.e. energy retailers); and (2) project ﬁnancing profes-\\nsionals. The survey responses for the ﬁrst group of respondents\\nwere facilitated by the Energy Retailers Association of Australia\\n(ERAA) and the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to remove any bias\\nassociated with knowledge of the authors. 11 ﬁrms responded and\\ngiven the relatively small number of materially substantive parti-\\ncipants in the sector, we believe this sample size is in fact quite\\nrobust because we understand that the most signiﬁcant partici-\\npants (by market share) have been included in the sample. That\\nsaid, we acknowledge that such a small size requires further\\nvalidation of results which we provide in the following analysis.\\nThe second group of respondents was contacted directly. The\\nsurvey size for project ﬁnancing professionals was 14 banks and\\n10 responses were received representing a response rate of 71%.\\nThe results of the survey of large-scale renewable energy devel-\\nopers and electricity retailers are presented in Table 2.\\n\\nThe results contained in Table 2 conﬁrm that ongoing policy\\nuncertainty is impeding the efﬁcient clearing and indeed, func-\\ntioning of the LGC market. The mean of responses indicates that\\nmarket participants expect that new generation will be required to\\nbe operational by 2015 to ensure that demand is met. These views\\nof market participants align with our modeling presented in\\nSection 3, which is important given our earlier comments on the\\nexistence of market arbitrage. The mean of responses provided in\\nrelation to the ‘efﬁcient’ market price was the price band $45–$50\\nper certiﬁcate, signiﬁcantly above the current market price of $36\\nper certiﬁcate. Again, this aligns closely with our modeling in\\n\\nSection 3 which produced an ‘efﬁcient’ market price of $39 to $42\\nper certiﬁcate (depending upon the discount rate applied). It is\\nlikely that our lower estimate of the ‘efﬁcient’ market price\\nrelative to the views of those surveyed is a function of our estimate\\nof the LRMC of wind being at the conservative (low) end of the full\\nspectrum of estimates of wind LRMC within the industry (perhaps\\ndue to locational or intermittency discounts).\\n\\nWhile we would not suggest such results could be relied upon\\nas conclusive, they are, in our opinion, persuasive in relation to our\\nhypothesis being robust.\\nImportantly, the majority of market\\nparticipants were of the view that the disparity of pricing between\\nimplied efﬁcient prices based on market fundamentals and actual\\nprices is the result of ongoing policy uncertainty – speciﬁcally\\ncarbon pricing and the LRET. When asked whether the LRET\\nshould be amended through the legislative review process under-\\ntaken by the Climate Change Authority, 10 out of the 11 partici-\\npants surveyed stated that it should not be amended. Importantly,\\nthe results of our analysis of this relatively small sample (by\\nnumber of participants) are supported by others including ROAM\\nConsulting (2012) and environmental market brokers such as\\nNextgen (2012) who noted that, “given the history of regulatory\\nchange that has occurred over the last ﬁve years in particular, having\\nconﬁdence in the long term appearance of the LRET is no easy thing.”\\nImportantly, our results are not speciﬁc to LRET market partici-\\npants.

Based upon the mean, these results mirror\\nthose of the market participants. In relation to the reasoning\\nbehind the misalignment between market fundamentals and\\npricing, the majority of respondents stated that uncertainty about\\nthe legislative review of LRET and the longevity of carbon pricing\\npolicy are key factors. It is unsurprising given the similarity of\\nviews on these issues that the majority of project ﬁnanciers do not\\nsupport further changes to LRET through the Climate Change\\nAuthority legislative review.\\n\\n5. Capital market efﬁciency losses and policy uncertainty\\n\\nPolicy uncertainty is evidently present within the large-scale\\nrenewable energy industry. There is a rich and detailed existing\\neconomic literature related to the costs of policy uncertainty in\\nAustralia's electricity markets (see for example Nelson et al, 2010;\\nFrontier Economics, 2010; Sinclair Knight Merz, 2011a; Deloitte,\\n2011; Nelson et al, 2012a; and Simshauser and Nelson, 2012). Two\\nbasic implications of ongoing public policy uncertainty on the\\nelectricity industry have been explored. Firstly, the impact of sub-\\noptimal investment in new generation capacity has been exam-\\nined. As electricity generation is highly capital intensive, it is\\nnecessary to take a long-term view of market fundamentals and\\nregulatory and legislative stability to ensure that capital is not\\nstranded. Secondly, the impacts of capital market efﬁciency losses\\nhave been examined.\\n\\nIt is the second form of uncertainty related to capital market\\nefﬁciency losses that we address in this article. Given the results\\npresented in Section 4 indicate that the market is concerned that\\nfurther changes to the LRET policy may be made as a result of a\\ngovernment response to the Climate Change Authority's legislative\\nreview, it is appropriate to ask whether actual material amend-\\nment of the policy in 2013 would result in additional risk\\npremiums being applied to large-scale renewable energy invest-\\nments. The framework applied by Simshauser and Nelson (2012) is\\nuseful for answering such a question. We have adopted this\\nframework in the current section to determine whether further\\namendment of the LRET will result in capital market efﬁciency\\nlosses.\\n\\n(2010)\\n\\nfound that\\n\\ninto market participant expectations about\\n\\nSimshauser and Nelson (2012) surveyed project ﬁnancing\\nprofessionals to determine pricing, tenors and participation in\\nthe market for funding large scale generation in the NEM.\\nSimshauser\\nthe NEM has more than\\n20,000 MW of privately owned (i.e. pre-existing and new entrant)\\ngenerating plant and around 17,000 MW (85%) of this is project\\nﬁnanced. With such a heavy reliance upon project ﬁnancing,\\nspreads on syndicated project debt provide a speciﬁc and relevant\\ninsight\\nthe risks\\nassociated with investment in electricity generation infrastructure.\\nThis is important for two reasons. First, historically much of the\\nplant introduced since the creation of the NEM in the late 1990s\\nhas been project ﬁnanced. Second, and looking forward, while it\\nmay well be true that the large retailer/developers (i.e. AGL\\nEnergy, Origin Energy, TRUenergy) may be theoretically able to\\nraise on-balance sheet ﬁnance from debt capital markets to avoid\\nthe use of project ﬁnance, such an outcome may lead to a\\nsubstantial concentration of renewable plant ownership. In a well\\nfunctioning market for new plant, a material proportion of the\\nlarge investment required under LRET should be project ﬁnanced\\n\\nTable 4\\nSurvey results on perceptions of PF facilities in 2006, 2008 and 2011.\\nSource: Simshauser and Nelson (2012).\\n\\n2006\\n\\n2008\\n\\n2011\\n\\nPF Spreads\\nSpread Movement\\nMax tenor\\nMax gearing\\nMLA Banks\\nSyndication Banks\\nActive Banks\\nSpread on BBB Bonds\\nSpread Movement\\n\\n100–120 bps\\nStable\\n12 years\\n65%+\\n3 or less\\n3 or less\\n29\\n85 bps\\nStable\\n\\n400–450 bps\\nUp 3.8 (cid:4)\\n3 years\\nApprox 55%\\n7–8 banks\\nClub deal\\n11\\n360 bps\\nUp 4.2 (cid:4)\\n\\n350–400 bps\\nDown 11%\\n7 years\\nApprox 60%\\n7–8 banks\\n4–8 banks\\n14\\n240 bps\\nDown 33%\\n\\nand undertaken by Independent Power Producers if for no other\\nreason than the predictable balance sheet and investment con-\\ncentration constraints of those large retailer/developers – hence\\nour interest in broader bank debt spreads.\\n\\nThe results of the Simshauser and Nelson (2012) survey are\\npresented in Table 4. Note the signiﬁcant increase in Project\\nFinance (PF) spreads for electricity generation from 2008 to 2011\\nrelative to those of BBB bonds (down only 11% compared to 33%).9\\nBBB bonds were used as a comparator. While corporate bonds are\\nnot necessarily good substitutes for PF, the relative change in\\npricing of both debt instruments is of course entirely relevant.\\nThey found that the most logical explanation of the elevated\\nspreads relative to local and global comparators was the ongoing\\npolicy uncertainty on greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion of\\nthe study was that the higher spreads arising from carbon pricing\\nuncertainty would result\\nin increased electricity prices for\\nconsumers.\\n\\nThe 2012 study noted that volumes in syndicated debt markets\\nretreated signiﬁcantly during the ‘great recession’ of 2008 and\\n2009. While markets have rebounded, the most recent observa-\\ntions point to further potential retreats due to ongoing concerns\\nabout economic conditions in Europe and the fragility of some\\nbanking industries. Fig. 6 shows total syndicated debt transactions\\nbroken down by quarter and year since 2004. While 2011 saw a\\nsigniﬁcant\\nthe ‘great recession’, quarter on\\nquarter trends for 2012 reveal a subsequent retreat in syndicated\\ndebt.\\n\\nturnaround post\\n\\nThis has non-trivial implications for Australian energy markets\\ngiven around half of Australian investment funding (debt and\\nequity) is sourced internationally as Simshauser and Catt (2012)\\nnoted. Simshauser and Catt (2012) estimate that between 2010\\nand 2015, $85.9 billion in capital will be required within the\\nelectricity supply system. Capital\\ninvestment on new network\\ninfrastructure and upgrades to existing equipment was forecast\\nto hit $43 billion. Fully $33.6 billion was projected for reﬁnancing\\nof existing network infrastructure while $9.4 billion was forecast\\nto be used to reﬁnance existing power stations.\\nIn addition,\\nincremental capital between 2012 and 2020 related to the LRET\\nis likely to be between $20 billion and $30 billion.\\n\\nThis vast capital inﬂow requirement within Australia needs to\\nbe assessed within a domestic capital market which is increasingly\\nskewed towards energy and resources. Fig. 7 shows private capital\\ninvestment in mining, manufacturing and other industries since\\n2000. Fig. 7 illustrates that capital expenditure on mining has risen\\nby around 100% since 2009. It is therefore critical that considera-\\ntion be given to the importance of capital inﬂows for ﬁnancing\\nresource and energy projects – a thematic identiﬁed in Simshauser\\n\\n9 The Project Finance (PF) spreads for electricity generation effectively repre-\\n\\nsent the speciﬁc cost of ﬁnancing electricity generation infrastructure.\\n\\n\\x0c394\\n\\nT.

Private new capital expenditure by industry.\\nSource: ABS (2012).\\n\\n(2010b). As a consequence of credit concentration limits, domestic\\nbanks are simply incapable of funding all new capital expenditure\\nin the sector. Given the vast capital ﬁnancing requirements of the\\nelectricity sector between now and 2020 and potential constraints\\nin global syndicated debt activity as a result of global economic\\nconditions (and indeed Basel III reforms), it is paramount that\\nenergy policymakers consider the impacts of policy uncertainty on\\nthe attractiveness of Australia (and the Australian energy sector in\\nparticular) as a destination. Intense competition for capital both\\ndomestically (between sectors) and internationally (between\\ncountries) underscores the importance of maintaining policy\\nstability for investors in electricity infrastructure with long-lived\\nasset lives.\\n\\nTo test whether policy uncertainty in relation to large-scale\\nrenewable energy would result in distortions related to pricing of\\ninfrastructure by these capital markets, we conducted a survey\\nof project ﬁnancing professionals as noted in Section 4. The results\\nof this survey are presented in Table 5.\\n\\nThe results of the survey presented in Table 5 are consistent\\nwith the thematic identiﬁed in Simshauser and Nelson (2012).\\nRespondents indicated that policy uncertainty (measured by\\nmaterial amendment to the LRET) would result in ﬁnancing\\n‘premium penalties’ being applied to both new renewable and\\nnew gas-ﬁred generation projects, which is to be expected. The\\nmean response was the band 51–100 bps providing an effective\\nmean of 75 bps above the reasonable credit margin over BBSW in\\n2012 of 275 bps.\\n\\nWe have applied these survey results to the PF Model utilised\\nin Simshauser and Nelson (2012) and documented in Nelson and\\nSimshauser (2013) to examine how changes in ﬁnancing para-\\nmeters impact on the underlying cost structures of baseload/\\nintermediate combined cycle gas turbine plant (CCGT), renewable\\nprojects (wind) and peaking open cycle gas turbines (OCGT). We\\nhave used the same range of assumptions published in Table 7 of\\nSimshauser and Nelson (2012) and so we do not intend to\\nreproduce them here.

Certainty scenario: In this scenario, we assume that the Climate\\nChange Authority recommendation of no substantive changes\\nto the operation of the LRET is supported by government, and\\ncritically, bi-partisan support for the policy in its current form\\ncontinues.11 Spreads on project ﬁnanced power generation\\nfacilities reﬂect uncertainty in relation to carbon pricing but\\nnot uncertainty in relation to renewable policy. This results in\\ncredit margins of 275 bps over BBSW and enables ﬁrms to\\nsecure longer facility tenors. Gas input pricing for CCGT is\\nassumed to be steady at $4.50/GJ.\\n\\n2. Uncertainty scenario: Key assumptions in this scenario relate to\\ngovernment implementing “material changes” to the operation\\nof the LRET. Bi-partisan support for the policy in its current\\nform evaporates, resulting in genuine policy uncertainty for\\ninvestors. Spreads on project facilities reﬂect both uncertainty\\nin relation to carbon pricing, and uncertainty in relation to\\nlarge-scale renewables. Credit margins\\ndevelopment of\\nincrease by 75 bps to 350 bps over BBSW, and facility tenors\\nare reduced, which heightens reﬁnancing risks and reduces\\nachievable debt levels within the capital structure of projects.\\nGas input pricing for CCGT remains unchanged and steady at\\n$4.50/GJ.\\n\\n3. High gas scenario: Primary assumptions in this scenario are that\\nas in the certainty scenario, the Climate Change Authority\\nrecommendations of no material changes to the operation of\\nthe LRET are adopted and bi-partisan support for the policy in\\nits current form continues. Spreads on project-ﬁnanced power\\ngeneration facilities reﬂect uncertainty in relation to carbon\\npricing but not uncertainty in relation to renewable policy. This\\nresults in credit margins of 275 bps over BBSW. However, gas\\ninput pricing for CCGT signiﬁcantly increases from $4.50/GJ to\\n$10.00/GJ reﬂecting high global demand for natural gas and the\\nlinkage of previously isolated Australian east-coast domestic\\ngas markets with LNG pricing (see Simshauser et al., 2011 for\\nfurther information on structural gas pricing shocks in Austra-\\nlia). Carbon pricing of $15/tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is\\nalso included in fuel costs. This scenario has been included to\\nreﬂect consideration of issues related to gas pricing raised by\\nRiesz and Tourneboeuf (2012), which as our partial equilibrium\\nanalysis subsequently reveals, is critically important for policy-\\nmakers to consider.\\n\\n10 Most recent observations for wind capital costs indicate prices are even\\nlower (see Trustpower (2012) which indicates pricing at $1630/kW). However, we\\nare uncertain as to whether such pricing includes the full cost of construction, and\\nspeciﬁcally, items such as interest during construction, owners project develop-\\nment costs, grid connection and so on. Accordingly, we have opted to use estimates\\nbased on information provided in BREE (2012).\\n\\n11 For further information on the Climate Change Authority's recommenda-\\ntions to leave the policy largely unchanged, see Climate Change Authority (2012).\\n\\nThe PF Model results for these three scenarios are presented in\\nFig. 8. Gearing is applied relatively consistently at between 60%\\nand 63%. This represents the main variation in application from\\nSimshauser and Nelson (2012) and explains the higher returns to\\nequity and lower interest payments in each of the results for the\\n200 MW wind project. Financing is provided using 5, 7, 10 and 12\\nyear tenors depending upon the scenario and technology.\\n\\nFig. 8 shows that, unsurprisingly, the unit cost of a 200 MW\\nwind project increases by $4.20/MWh (4.3%) from $98.57/MWh to\\n$102.77/MWh with the introduction of policy uncertainty. Impor-\\ntantly, the unit cost of a 1 (cid:4) 400 MW CCGT project also increases\\nby $0.73/MWh (1.1%) from $64.32/MWh to $65.05/MWh under the\\nsame conditions. The most material change in unit cost occurs\\nwith the signiﬁcant increase in gas pricing where CCGT costs\\nincrease to $103.22/MWh (i.e. above the cost of wind).\\n\\nDue to the different operating duties of an OCGT (peaking)\\nplant, the ﬁnancing results are very different to those of a CCGT, as\\nshown in Fig. 9, which presents the ‘carrying cost’ or ‘total ﬁxed\\ncosts’ (including a normal return on funds invested) for a 525 MW\\nplant comprising three units. This can be thought of as the fair\\nvalue of a $300/MWh call option written by new entrant peaking\\nplant. The incremental cost of an OCGT in moving from certainty\\nto uncertainty (scenario 1 to scenario 2) is $0.44/MWh.\\n\\n6. Partial equilibrium analysis – policy uncertainty and\\nelectricity prices\\n\\nTo assess the economic impact of our different scenarios on\\nelectricity prices, we assume ﬁnancing costs calculated in previous\\nsections begin to bind immediately from the date at which\\nlegislative change in response to the Climate Change Authority\\nreview is proposed (i.e. 2013). For simplicity, we have assumed\\nthat any legislative change would be announced in late 2013 and\\nimplemented in 2014. Higher LRMC costs associated with policy\\nchange would be revealed in the market from 2017 onwards as\\nnew plant is commissioned (and in practice, as existing plant is\\nreﬁnanced). CCGT forms the dominant base and intermediate load\\ntechnology while OCGT undertakes peaking duties.\\n\\nWe utilise the Optimal Plant Mix Model (OPM Model) from\\nSimshauser and Wild (2009) to undertake the analysis. This partial\\nequilibrium electricity system model simulates half-hour resolu-\\ntion and assumes perfect competition and essentially free entry to\\ninstall any combination of capacity that satisﬁes differentiable\\nconditions. As this model has been documented in Simshauser and\\nWild (2009), we do not intend to reproduce the details here.\\nA static graphical representation of the half-hourly modelling\\nresults is presented in Fig. 10.\\n\\nDemand has been projected utilising the latest forecasts from\\nthe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO, 2012).

We utilise the\\nmethodology outlined in Nelson et al. (2010) to distribute the\\naverage annual growth of 1.7% across deciles of actual 2011 NEM\\ndemand ranked by time.\\n\\nThe three scenarios outlined in the previous section have each\\nbeen modeled using the partial equilibrium framework discussed\\nabove. One additional scenario has also been modeled based upon\\nmaterial adjustment of the LRET targets to reﬂect recent commen-\\ntary related to electricity demand being softer than anticipated\\nwhen the LRET was ﬁrst legislated. Origin Energy (2012) made the\\nsalient point that with softening electricity demand, the RET\\nwould result in more than 20% of Australia's electricity being\\nsourced from renewable sources, at least given most recent\\nforecast information.\\n\\nThe power generation system cost results for each scenario are\\npresented in Table 6. The certainty scenario results in a system\\n\\naverage cost of $69.17/MWh between 2017 and 2021. The intro-\\nduction of policy uncertainty results in average system costs\\nincreasing by $0.69/MWh (1.00%) to $69.86/MWh. If the high gas\\nscenario were to materialise, average system costs would increase\\nby $33.88/MWh (49%) to $103.05/MWh. Additional costs of oper-\\nating higher LRMC renewable plant are revealed in LGC costs\\nwhich our subsequent analysis examines.\\n\\nTable 6 notes that uncertainty results in higher costs associated\\nwith servicing projected future demand. However, this ignores any\\npotential savings associated with reductions in LGC costs incurred\\nby retailers, then passed through to customers as reductions in\\nprices. These cost savings are signiﬁcant. We have utilised an\\nLRMC methodology represented graphically in Fig. 11.\\n\\nFig. 11 shows the revenues that a wind turbine would earn, on\\naverage.

Effectively, we have\\ncreated two scenarios\\n\\n(cid:1) Uncertainty: In the uncertainty scenario, we have assumed that\\nLRET targets beyond 2016 are not increased at all. Effectively,\\nthis scenario simulates a situation where the LRET policy is\\nrepealed. However, it presumes that existing investments are\\ngrandfathered (including projects committed through to 2014).\\nHigher wholesale energy costs (outlined in Table 6 previously)\\n\\nare incurred due to investor perceptions of regulatory risk as a\\nresult of the material amendment of the policy. However, these\\nhigher costs are somewhat offset by the reduced LGC liability\\nbetween 2017 and 2021 as a result of repeal of the LRET\\nlegislation.12\\n\\n(cid:1) Uncertainty (low demand): For the uncertainty (low demand)\\nscenario, we have assumed that LRET targets are reduced in\\n2014 to reﬂect softening projections of electricity demand in\\n2020 and a desire to achieve no more than 20% renewable\\nelectricity by 2020 given lower demand forecasts. Using the\\nlogic in Origin (2012), we have reduced the targets between\\n2016 and 2020 to ensure a linear approach to 27 TWh in 2020,\\ndown from 41 TWh. Higher wholesale energy costs (outlined in\\nTable 6 previously) are incurred due to investor perceptions of\\nregulatory risk as a result of the material amendment of the\\npolicy. However, these higher costs are somewhat offset by the\\nreduced LGC liability between 2017 and 2021 as a result of\\nlower LRET targets relative to current legislation.13\\n\\nOur results for the two scenarios identiﬁed above are presented\\n\\nin Fig. 12.\\n\\nFig. 12 shows the costs and beneﬁts associated with signiﬁ-\\ncantly amending the LRET.

The lower implied LGC pricing (relative to Section 3) is a function of higher wholesale\\npricing in 2017 ($64.32/MWh compared to $55/MWh for 2015 energy futures contracts available at the time of writing). For our modeling, we have used the actual yearly\\nestimates produced through our partial equilibrium analysis (rather than the cost of a CCGT or average wholesale prices).\\n\\nFig. 12. NPV of net cost to consumer of uncertainty and uncertainty scenarios.\\n\\nboth scenarios, the higher wholesale energy costs, as identiﬁed in\\nTable 6, are greater. The end result is a net cost to the consumer of\\n$51 million (NPV 2012$) if the LRET is effectively repealed. Of\\ncourse, the costs associated with this scenario would ultimately\\ndissipate, while the beneﬁts would more than likely be sustained.\\nAnd so over the very long run, these results might reverse,\\nalthough this is dependent upon Australia's policy of repealing\\nthe LRET being consistent with global trends (which based upon\\nevidence presented in Section 2 appears somewhat unlikely). But\\nover the period of our examination, that is, from 2012 to 2021,\\nthere would be a net cost to consumers from repealing the policy,\\neven with a grandfathering of existing projects. If the LRET target\\nwas reduced to change with ﬂuctuating demand, the net cost to\\nconsumers was found to be $119 million (NPV 2012$) over the\\nperiod 2012–2021. While these results appear counter-intuitive,\\nthey are a simple function of the fact that there are real costs\\nassociated with policy uncertainty.\\n\\n7. Policy recommendations\\n\\nIn its ﬁnal report, the Climate Change Authority recommended\\nno material changes be made to the LRET policy. A key ﬁnding of\\nthis article is that this ﬁnding is robust. Material amendments to\\nthe policy would result in heightened uncertainty in relation to\\nenergy policy with resultant costs being applied by ﬁnanciers of\\npower generation, and a further widening of the theoretical to\\nactual prices. According to the modelling presented here, these\\ncosts would manifest themselves as higher costs to consumers –\\nup to $119 million (NPV 2012$) between 2017 and 2021, and\\nsharper run-up in LRET prices when shortages inevitably occur.14\\n\\n14 We acknowledge the somewhat arbitrary nature of modeling between 2017\\nand 2021. However, we expect that analysis beyond 2021 would not be relevant\\ngiven that higher costs applied by project ﬁnanciers would eventually abate.\\n\\n\\x0cT.

If legislation is changed, then it\\nsets a worrying precedent that the legislative/regulatory goalposts\\nwill be moved again and again over the next 20 to 30 years.”\\n\\nIn addition to our broad conclusions in relation to policy\\ncertainty, we believe the dynamic discussed by Riesz and\\nTourneboeuf (2012) in relation to uncertainties about gas pricing\\nrequires greater consideration. Policymakers should have regard to\\nall of the factors which may result in wholesale energy price\\npressures when considering the merits of renewable energy. The\\nnature of the NEM with its uniform, ﬁrst-price, energy-only gross\\npool auction design means that plant with very low short-run\\nmarginal costs (such as wind farms) have little or even negative\\nimpacts on pool prices. Conversely, the cost structure of a gas-ﬁred\\nplant is a direct function of the gas price. Our research has shown\\nthat a signiﬁcant increase in gas prices could result in gas-ﬁred\\nplant becoming more expensive than wind. We do not make\\nconclusions about the likelihood of this occurring, only that\\nrenewable energy with no fuel cost should be contrasted with\\ngas in this environment.\\n\\nFig. 13 shows indices for gas prices and capital expenditure for\\nwind, OCGT and CCGT for the period 2000 to 2011. There are\\nseveral conclusions that can be drawn by policy makers in relation\\nto future pricing. Firstly, wind turbine prices are trending down\\nwhile gas prices are trending up. Secondly, capital expenditure\\ntrends for OCGT, CCGT and wind are relatively similar.\\nIt is\\nreasonable to state that the most recent pricing for turbines is\\nlikely to be temporary given the somewhat unusually high $A\\ndriven by international investor appetite for Australian denomi-\\nnated sovereign debt.15 The trends in Fig. 13 appear consistent\\nwith those presented by US researchers (see Bolinger and Wiser,\\n2011).\\nIn this context, and given the net cost to society of\\namending the LRET policy, it would appear prudent to maintain\\nexisting policy commitments.\\n\\n8. Conclusion\\n\\nThis article has found that ongoing uncertainty in relation to\\nthe future of large-scale renewable energy policy in Australia is\\npreventing the LGC market from operating efﬁciently. Our survey\\nof market participants conﬁrms that buyers and sellers of LGCs are\\nconcerned about the potential for further legislative change and\\nthis concern is manifesting itself in poor pricing and capital\\nallocation decision making. Arbitrage opportunities clearly exist\\nbut no party is willing to clear the arbitrage based on battle-\\nhardened historical experience. Based upon the modelling pre-\\nsented in this article, our conclusion is clear – material amend-\\nments to the LRET would result in net costs to consumers of\\nbetween $51 million and $119 million (2012$). Based upon this\\nconclusion, our recommendation is that the LRET should remain in\\nplace and without amendment if conﬁdence in the policy is to be\\nrestored. It is important to note that bipartisan support for the\\npolicy continues as indicated by recent statements by political\\n\\n15 The issue here is that, at the time of writing, Australia's terms of trade had\\nbeen falling while the Australian dollar had concurrently remained unusually\\nstrong.\\n\\n\\x0c400\\n\\nT.

Introduction\\n\\nIn 2009, the Australian government legislated a Renewable\\nEnergy Target (RET) of 20 per cent by 2020 (i.e. approximately\\n45,000 GWh of RE sourced electricity) in-line with its national plan\\nfor a clean energy future [1,2]. While the plan is aimed at directly\\nmitigating the impacts of climate change, the ﬂow down of this\\ntarget and the development of Renewable Energy (RE) supply at the\\nstate, territory and municipal\\nlevels of government presents\\na signiﬁcant challenge [3,4]. Accordingly, the impositions of a poor\\nRE development framework for RE asset construction and deploy-\\nment may render the national RET unachievable in the remaining\\ntimeframe.\\n\\nImportant in the context of our study, the policy opportunities\\nthat have been canvassed by various researchers and RE advocates\\nprovide a series of policy prescriptions and actions that support the\\nachievement of the RET and any state-level targets [5]. These\\ninitiatives can take various forms, including RE Portfolio Standards\\n(RPS), government tendering of RE projects, tax beneﬁts for RE\\n\\n* Corresponding author.

However,\\nthe selection of RET enabling actions,\\ncommencement of the Australian carbon pricing legislation in mid\\n2012, and the relatively short 10-year timeframe for meeting the\\nnational RET, presents some immediate challenges for domestic\\ngovernments [2,6].\\n\\nIn this investigation, the views of ﬁrms and stakeholder orga-\\nnizations confronted with RE policies and governmental actions in\\nthe Australian state of Queensland are the primary subject of our\\nanalysis. In sum, we seek to answer three major research questions.\\nFirst, what are the barriers and impediments to increasing RE in\\nnational regions and states? Some studies show that RE solutions\\noften face difﬁcult technical, institutional and economic problems\\nand impediments (e.g. poor ﬁnancing arrangements, high technical\\nrisks, unhelpful regulation,\\nIn\\na pragmatic sense, understanding the various contextual impedi-\\nments faced by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations would be\\ninstructive for researchers and industry practitioners. Second,\\nshould state or regional governments establish targets for RE\\nsupply? For example, while some countries apply targets to speciﬁc\\nRE sources (e.g. wind, solar, biomass) [11e14], Australia allows its\\nstates and regions to establish their own renewable energy plans,\\npolicies and targets (e.g. the New South Wales (NSW) state\\ngovernment has adopted the national RET as its target [4]. In\\ntracking its progress, a recent independent audit of NSW electricity\\n\\nfaulty market systems) [7e9].\\n\\n\\x0c120\\n\\nN.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127\\n\\nsupply showed that 6.8 per cent of that state’s electricity supply is\\ncurrently being met by RE sources, while electricity prices have\\nrisen by 6 per cent due to generators’ RET commitments) [15].\\nHowever, other studies show that striving to meet an RET might\\nresult in the creation of multiple policy and regulatory instruments\\n[12] while also delivering less positive outcomes,\\nincluding\\nincreased unemployment and reduced energy security [14]. Given\\nthis background, it is important to understand the beneﬁts and\\nproblems associated with setting state-level RETs. Finally, what\\nactions should states and regions take in order to meet national\\nlevel RETs? Our extant RE literature argues successfully that various\\ngovernment policies and actions can aid the growth of RE supplies\\nin regions and countries [16,17]. However, in our case we are\\nspeciﬁcally examining the views and recommendations of ﬁrms\\nand stakeholder organizations that have an exposure to the\\ndevelopment of RE sourced electricity in the state of Queensland.\\nHence, the summation of responses to these questions enables\\nunderstanding of the context, appropriateness of state-level RETs,\\nand policies and actions that support RE supply expansion.\\n\\nThe balance of our paper is developed as follows. In the next\\nsection we will discuss and contrast some of the critical RE litera-\\nture and theory related to our study, including a detailed expla-\\nnation of the research setting. Next, the study will describe our\\nstructured research method, including the data collection and\\nanalysis procedures, followed by a presentation of the results and\\ntheir discussion. Our concluding statements highlight the impor-\\ntance of understanding what barriers and actions ﬁrms and\\nstakeholder organizations consider to be important for the growth\\nof RE supply, while noting the research limitations.\\n\\n2. Building renewable energy supply e Barriers, targets,\\npolicies and actions\\n\\nThe literature explicating the barriers to RE growth provides an\\narray of socio-technical problems and hurdles that confront ﬁrms\\nand industries [7e9,18]. In some instances, the problems can take\\na strong behavioural form, such as the lack of awareness or infor-\\nmation to make sound judgments and decisions within the ﬁrm\\n[18], while in other circumstances the impediments might be based\\non poor policy, administrative process or regulatory systems design\\nthat deny generators adequate business opportunities [8,9,19].\\nOther barriers to the advancement of RE supply can take the form of\\nunhelpful and poorly designed energy markets [19,20]; sub-\\noptimal research and development, heightened technical risks,\\nand limited innovation and knowledge creation in the ﬁeld of RE\\nsystems [8,18,21,22]; and, inadequate RE investment incentives and\\nproject ﬁnancing arrangements [5,11,23,24]. In a collective sense,\\ndespite the substantial number of identiﬁed impediments across\\nthe RE literature, disciplinary experts are conﬁdent that these\\nbarriers may ﬁnd some level of resolution with the delivery of\\nsuitable policies and actions [12,14,16,17]. In this study, the barriers\\nidentiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations should allow us\\nto understand the larger RE business context and operational\\nimpediments to meeting the national RET.\\n\\nFoundation studies show that RETs form part of the larger set of\\nRE issues [21]. In particular, the literature shows that RE schemes\\ncan take a quantitative position (e.g. RETs, quota systems for green\\ncertiﬁcate trading, bidding and auction systems for carbon credits)\\nor a more price directed stance (e.g. Feed-in Tariffs (FiT), carbon\\nit is considered quite\\npricing mechanisms) [25]. Accordingly,\\nappropriate that RETs, and possibly targets at the state, regional and\\nmunicipal\\nform part of a successful RE development\\nframework [4,26,27]. The more global views of RETs, shows us that\\npossibly 10e50 per cent of our primary energy needs will be met\\nthrough RE sources by 2050 [27]. Speciﬁc to this study, an overview\\n\\nlevels,\\n\\nof global RETs shows a range of RE sourced electricity generation\\ntargets from 20 to 35 per cent by 2020, stretching out to increas-\\ningly more optimistic targets and outcomes of 50e80 per cent by\\n2050 [27]. We also noted that these types of aspirational RETs can\\nsometimes be set at less challenging (more easily achievable) levels\\nin smaller countries (e.g. 3 per cent) [28], while also requiring the\\napplication of a strict deﬁnition to assure target efﬁcacy (e.g. share\\nof RE sourced electricity generation is based on actual supply or\\nproduction not installed capacity) [10,25]. However, despite some\\nof the intricacies in setting RETs, we would argue that under-\\nstanding the types of state-level targets that might be established,\\nand the utility of these targets for ﬁrms and stakeholder organi-\\nzations, will assist and inform the development of effective policies\\nand actions.\\n\\nGovernment policies and actions represent the engine room for\\nRE supply development [16,17]. Some of our earlier studies in RE\\ntechnology show us that appropriate policies can act as the glue\\nthat supports positive linkages and actions between institutions\\nand actors in communities [21,29]. Indeed, some researchers depict\\nthe relationship between policy and actions as simply: “if we\\nestablish a speciﬁc RE policy goal, then we need distinct programs and\\ntechnologies to accomplish this” [21,29]. Several other studies point\\nto the requirement for effective policies that offer government\\nassistance packages (where required), investment and ﬁnancial\\nincentives arrangements, workable policies for RE FiT, cooperative\\nworking systems for private and public organizations, industry\\ndevelopment and equipment manufacturing assistance, and stim-\\nulants\\ninnovation and design\\nsystems\\n[5,8,22e24,30]. Importantly, these types of policy levers can serve\\nas high level frameworks for actions and activities that support the\\ngrowth and advancement of RE assets, infrastructure, supply and\\nequipment manufacturing [7,13,23,24,26,31]. In this study, we are\\nseeking to explore and expose the types of policies and actions,\\nidentiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations, which may\\nenable the state of Queensland to meet its obligation under the\\nnational RET.\\n\\nand enablers of\\n\\n3. Renewable energy supply in Queensland e An overview\\n\\nEarlier studies that focused on RE generation in Australia\\ndepicted a slow and cautious start for the country [32]. The original\\n2001 national RET was modest seeking only a nominal 2 per cent of\\nRE supply by 2010, thereby equating to 9500 GWh of electricity\\nfrom renewable sources [32]. Also, other studies suggested that\\nAustralian RE supply developments could beneﬁt from repricing\\nelectricity and taking account of carbon-based pollution and other\\nenvironmental impacts from its dominant coal ﬁred power gener-\\nators [33]. Arguably, these types of electricity price adjustments\\ncould potentially stimulate further interest and investment in RE\\nprojects across Australia.\\n\\nThe most recent studies from researchers, and the Australian\\ngovernment, show RE sourced electricity generation in Australia\\ntotalling approximately 7 per cent, with abundant fossil fuels still\\nserving as the primary energy source for the country [34,35]. In\\naddition, the latest energy supply trends show that Queensland\\nranks third in overall RE installed generation capacity behind NSW\\nand Victoria. Accordingly, in order to meet the national RET, each\\nstate and territory must play an active role in developing RE\\nsupplies.\\n\\nQueensland is Australia’s second largest state covering over 1.9\\nmillion square kilometres of land and home to over 4.5 million\\ncitizens [36]. The state economy is based on strong mineral\\nresources (mainly coal, bauxite and copper) and tourism sectors,\\nwith primary industry production of beef, bananas, sugar cane,\\npineapples, peanuts, grains, cotton and wool. The state economy is\\n\\n\\x0cN.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127\\n\\n121\\n\\nfounded on competitively priced electricity inputs that are\\nprimarily supplied by various coal ﬁred power stations built during\\nthe 1980e2000 period [37]. However, this results in Queensland\\nhaving the highest per capita carbon emissions of all the Australian\\nstates and territories [37].\\n\\nQueensland is also one of six interconnected regions that supply\\napproximately A$11 billion worth of electricity under a National\\nElectricity Market (NEM) that was created in 1998 [38]. The\\nAustralian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) uses a centrally\\ncontrolled dispatch process to schedule and match electricity\\nproducer outputs and consumer usage in a spot price market,\\nwhere Australian electricity laws and rules provide the operational\\nframework. NEM regulation is provided by the Australian Energy\\nMarket Commission (managing the rule making process and\\nassessing proposed rule changes) and the Australian Energy\\nRegulator (monitoring and enforcement of rules and law compli-\\nance). Importantly, the AEMO has stated that the current RET\\nwill lead to changes in the mix of electricity supply sources and\\nlocation origins in the coming years, including RE supply from\\nQueensland [39].\\n\\nIn response to the national RET, the Queensland government\\nestablished the Ofﬁce of Clean Energy (OCE) in early 2009 to\\nadminister the Queensland Renewable Energy Plan (QREP) [40].\\nThe QREP applies to smallemedium and large scale RE develop-\\nments (for the retail distribution and high voltage service provider\\nnetworks, respectively) and provides the high level framework for\\nthe state to achieve its share of the national RET, estimated at\\n2500 MW installed capacity or 9000 GWh of electricity supply [40].\\nIn executing the QREP, the Queensland government has moved\\nforward with several initiatives and projects as follows.\\n\\n3.1. Biomass\\n\\nSugar cane waste (or bagasse) provides approximately 70 per\\ncent of the state’s RE supplies. The state government provided A$9\\nmillion, from its A$50 million Queensland Renewable Energy Fund\\n(QREF), for the development of Mackay Sugar’s energy cogenera-\\ntion plant at the Racecourse Mill near Mackay, North Queensland.\\nIn addition to serving the current energy needs of the mill (65 MW),\\nthe replacement plant will deliver an extra 27 MW of capacity to\\nthe state electricity grid commencing in 2013.\\n\\n3.2. Solar (hot water and photovoltaic)\\n\\nThe high levels of solar resources in Queensland (known as the\\n‘Sunshine State’) provide signiﬁcant opportunities for solar power\\ngeneration and deployment. The Queensland Solar Bonus Scheme\\nhas seen over 30,000 customers install roof top photovoltaic (PV)\\nsystems (with a 44 cents per kWh residential gross FiT applied), and\\nover 100 MW installed capacity during 2008e2010. The state\\ngovernment supplemented this with the Queensland Solar Homes\\nProgram where a bulk purchase of solar panels allowed 1000\\nhomes to be ﬁtted with PV systems.\\n\\nA state solar initiatives package valued at A$115 million is being\\nused to fund projects such as Virtual Solar Power Stations\\n(500 MW) in towns and communities (using PV and solar hot water\\nsystems); the A$60 million Solar Hot Water Rebate Scheme\\n(A$600e1000 per solar hot water installations); the A$5.8 million\\nPV system installation program for 420 kindergartens; the A$9.9\\nmillion Solar Sport and Communities initiative to support solar\\nsystems installations in sports clubs and community organizations;\\nand, the A$35.4 million for the Kogan Creek Solar Thermal systems\\ninstallation.\\n\\nIn addition, the state government has also invested A$60 million\\nin the Solar and Energy Efﬁciency in State Schools program that will\\n\\nsee over 1250 schools ﬁtted with PV systems, and provided another\\nA$4 million for the Wide Bay Community solar farm to power\\nhealth services facilities in the Hervey Bay region. The state has also\\nprovided A$5 million for Townsville’s participation in the federal\\nSolar Cities Program, while A$6.6 million has been allocated from\\nthe QREF for solar roof top arrays at the Carrara Gold Coast stadium\\nand the University of Queensland campus, and a solar atlas (radi-\\nation recording) project in western Queensland.\\n\\nAt the national level, in June 2011 the Solar Dawn Consortium\\nwas awarded a federal Solar Flagships program grant to build\\na 250 MW solar thermal and gas hybrid plant (85 per cent or\\n212 MW of renewable energy capacity) near Chinchilla in western\\nQueensland to commence operations in 2015 [41].\\n\\n3.3. Hydro\\n\\nThe state operates\\n\\nthree small hydroelectricity stations\\n(167 MW) at Barron Gorge, Koombooloomba and Kareeya in North\\nQueensland. The Queensland government is currently engaged in\\na Memorandum of Cooperation with the Papua New Guinea (PNG)\\ngovernment, PNG Energy Developments Limited and Origin Energy,\\nto facilitate development of a large hydroelectricity project on the\\nPurari River in PNG. Electricity will be supplied to the NEM through\\nsubsea transmission lines that connect\\nto Townsville, North\\nQueensland.\\n\\n3.4. Wind\\n\\nThe Windy Hill wind farm in north Queensland has 12 MW of\\ninstalled capacity. AGL Limited has bought the development rights\\nto the Coopers Gap wind farm site which has an estimated 500 MW\\ngeneration capacity. The OCE has also published a wind map iden-\\ntifying which areas might be suitable for energy generation projects.\\n\\n3.5. Geothermal\\n\\nThe state has provided A$15 million for the Queensland\\nGeothermal Energy Centre of Excellence. The centre is a research\\nand development hub that will examine opportunities to generate\\ngeothermal energy using new turbine, cooling tower and heat\\nexchanger designs; power transmission and network modelling;\\nand reservoir exploration and management.\\nIn addition, A$5\\nmillion from the QREF has been allocated to investigate and identify\\nsuitable hot rock formations in close proximity to existing high\\nvoltage transmission networks.\\n\\n3.6. Wave and tidal\\n\\nThe state has provided two small research and development\\ngrants to a total of A$0.28 million to assist in building concept\\ndemonstrators for a ﬂoating wave power generator and a tidal\\nturbine system.\\n\\nImportantly, these QREP activities have seen the RE sourced\\nelectricity generation capacities of Queensland grow by 29 per cent\\nover 2008e2010. Table 1 shows a comparison of the installed RE\\ncapacity for the period 2008e2010 and the 2020 target. While this\\ngrowth in installed capacity has merit, the supply of electricity from\\nRE sources is still well below the 20 per cent target. The state\\ngovernment advised that in 2010, the total electricity generation\\ncapacity in Queensland was 14,500 MW with coal and gas ﬁred\\npower stations accounting for 87 per cent of the capacity. While\\nQueensland’s RE sourced electricity generation capacity was\\napproximately 7 per cent of total state capacity, only 4 per cent of the\\nstate’s actual electricity supply was provided by renewable sources\\n\\n\\x0c122\\n\\nN.J.

Hence, as\\nwe noted from earlier studies, the difference between installed\\ngeneration capacity and actual electricity supply targets will need\\nclariﬁcation and agreement in the context of the QREP [10,25].\\n\\nHowever, this is not the only problem facing the Queensland\\ngovernment. The success of the QREP, and meeting the state’s\\nobligation under the national RET, is predicated on securing A$3.5\\nbillion of the A$12 billion RE investments target set by the federal\\n[1,2]. Hence, under the current global ﬁnancial\\ngovernment\\nconditions, ﬁnding over A$3 billion worth of investments for state\\nRE projects may not be easy in the immediate to medium term [43].\\nGiven this context, understanding some of the practical barriers to\\nthe\\nRE developments; how state-level RETs might support\\nachievement of the legislated national RET; and, what actions and\\npolicies might prove effective in delivering higher levels of RE\\nsupply would appear instructive and important. We would also\\nargue that looking at these issues through the lens of ﬁrms and\\nstakeholder organizations involved in the RE industry should create\\na block of highly pragmatic and applicative knowledge.\\n\\n4. Methodology\\n\\n4.1. Data sources and collection\\n\\nThe data was collected on 30 October 2011 from the Queensland\\ngovernment web pages that were established for the inquiry into\\n‘Growing Queensland’s Renewable Energy Electricity Sector’, con-\\nducted by the state’s Environment and Resources Committee [44].\\nThe committee was tasked to examine and report on ‘the oppor-\\ntunities and challenges for the Queensland Government associated\\nwith increasing the proportion of electricity generated from renewable\\nenergy sources in Queensland’ [44]. Importantly, the scope of this\\ninquiry provided the ﬁrm and stakeholder organization data for our\\nstudy (i.e. responses on RE development barriers, state-level RETs,\\nand policies and actions that support RE expansion). Data in the\\nform of written submissions from executives and managers in ﬁrms\\nand stakeholder government and non-government organizations\\n(GOs and NGOs) were collected and catalogued. A summary of the\\n44 ﬁrms and organizations is presented in Table 2.\\n\\n4.2. Research technique and analysis\\n\\nA qualitative research method has been used for this study in\\norder to collect, structure, and analyse the written submissions\\nfrom ﬁrms, GOs and NGOs [45,46]. The study is consistent with\\nother stakeholder inquiries where written statements related to\\na primary issue of concern are individually and collectively ana-\\nlysed [47e49]. The study’s data structure has been created to\\naccurately trace ﬁrm and stakeholder organization responses to\\nquestions associated with barriers to RE supply expansion, state-\\nlevel RETs, and policies and actions for RE developments, under the\\nprecise scope of the government inquiry [44,50].\\n\\nFirm (18)\\nRio Tinto\\n\\nThe Solar Guys\\n\\nSmart Grid Partners\\n\\nAGL Energy\\n\\nOrigin Energy\\n\\nInterGen Australia\\n\\nInﬁgen\\n\\nMackay Sugar Limited\\n\\nDarwalla Milling Company\\n\\nRocky Point Green Power\\nTransﬁeld Holdings\\n\\nGE energy Australia and\\n\\nNew Zealand\\nConergy Australia\\n\\nSucrogen Australia\\n\\nVestas Australia Wind\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\nWindlab\\nBetter Place Australia\\nGO (10)\\nGold Coast City Council\\nBrisbane City Council\\n\\nLarge international resources ﬁrm.

The written\\ncontent was extracted and allocated to one of three speciﬁc data-\\nbase structures (i.e. barriers, state-level RETs, and policies and\\nactions) to maintain data traceability and assure analytical integrity\\n[45,46,50]. A total of 335 statements were analysed and categorized\\n(e.g. ﬁnancial,\\ninfrastructure, technical, regulatory) during the\\ncourse of the study. Following this procedure, the results from each\\ndata structure was summarised and the highest ranked categories\\npresented in the discussion of results.\\n\\n5. Results and discussion\\n\\n5.1. Barriers to regional renewable energy supply growth\\n\\nFirms and stakeholder organizations identiﬁed a range of\\nﬁnancial,\\nregulatory, economic, and\\ninformation barriers to RE supply growth in Queensland. A\\nsummary of the RE supply barriers are presented in Table 3.\\n\\ninfrastructure,\\n\\ntechnical,\\n\\nThe six categories of barriers cover 87 per cent of all responses\\nand are consistent with much of the RE literature [18,51]. A group of\\nﬁnance-related issues provided the most prominent barrier to the\\ngrowth of RE supply in Queensland. Firms and stakeholders stated\\nthat the high capital costs associated with large scale RE projects in\\nremote regions dampened potential investments (e.g. the federal\\nsolar ﬂagships program round one winning projects will build\\na 250 MW solar thermal gas hybrid power plant in western\\nQueensland, and a 150 MW solar farm in western New South Wales,\\nat a cost of more than A$2 billion) [41]. Also, the lack of suitable\\nlonger term ﬁnancial\\nincentives in the form of state-level\\ncommercial FiT, government and taxation subsidies, favourable RE\\n(green) certiﬁcate pricing levels, and RE systems purchase rebate\\nschemes were also highlighted as major impediments to increased\\nRE sourced electricity supply. Our investigations also show that the\\ncurrent contracting ﬁscal climate in Australia [52], and the inability\\nto negotiate proﬁtable long-term (25e30 year) Power Purchase\\nAgreements (PPAs) with government businesses and private power\\ncompanies are acting as barriers to RE developments [53].\\n\\nThe second major set of barriers is concentrated on the avail-\\nability of suitably robust and proximately located infrastructure. In\\nrelation to large scale RE developments,\\nfederal government\\nstudies show that much of the state network is established in\\na narrow corridor running along the eastern seaboard of the state,\\nand well away from the rich solar and wind resources in far west\\nand far northern Queensland [35]. Also, a public admission by the\\nstate government’s Energy Minister that the retail electricity\\nnetwork possesses insufﬁcient capacity to cope with new small and\\nmedium scale solar power installations reinforces the views pre-\\nsented by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations [54]. It should be\\nnoted that these infrastructure barriers also come with signiﬁcant\\nﬁnancial expenditure, given the substantial costs associated with\\nthe high voltage and retail electricity networks’ upgrades.\\n\\nTable 3\\nBarriers to RE supply growth in Queensland.\\n\\nBarriers\\n\\nFinance\\n\\ne High project capital costs\\ne Insufﬁcient ﬁnancial incentives\\ne Project ﬁnance availability\\ne Power purchase agreements\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\ne Insufﬁcient network capacity\\ne Remote grid connections and access\\n\\nTechnical\\n\\ne Technology intermittency and storage\\ne Lack of a skilled workforce\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\ne Complex zoning and planning\\ne Multi-tiered government approvals\\ne Land access and use\\n\\nEconomic\\n\\ne Abundant fossil fuel resources\\ne Cheap coal ﬁred power\\n\\nNo. of statements\\n\\n39\\n\\n16\\n\\n16\\n\\n15\\n\\n11\\n\\nInformation, education, and awareness\\nTotal\\n\\n11\\n108\\n\\nThe technical barriers identiﬁed by the ﬁrms and stakeholders\\nprovide a signiﬁcant challenge. First, while energy storage and\\nrelocation devices, such as hydrogen cells, combined heat and\\npower, compressed air, pumped hydro, new and old battery, super\\ncapacitor, and superconductor systems, continue along their\\ndevelopment pathways [55,56]; much of the state’s remotely\\nlocated RE sources requires technical storage and relocation\\nmechanisms to support their operation and control intermittency\\nof power delivery to the grid. Pivotally, the state government has\\nadmitted that the emerging development of storage and control\\ntechnologies will assist with delivering RE developments in the\\nfuture [40]. Second, the ability to maintain a competent technical\\nworkforce and skills base is difﬁcult under the current economic\\nconditions. The current sustained mining and resources boom in\\nAustralia is a positive drain on skilled technical workers and\\nundermines the development of a stable RE industry workforce\\n[52]. In sum, these technical issues pose a serious challenge to\\nenlarged RE supply in the immediate to medium term.\\n\\nFirms and stakeholder organizations assert that the regulatory\\nhurdles to enhanced RE supply provide an administrative and legal\\nimpost to future developments. As an example, a review of the state\\nRE project development process highlights three major electricity\\nlevels) gateways; three levels of\\nindustry (state and national\\ngovernment planning and approvals legislation, including a six part\\nproject development assessment system; separate water and vege-\\ntation, environmental, and indigenous culture and heritage testing\\nprotocols; and land leasing and/or acquisition procedures [57].\\nAccordingly, the framework for RE regulation established by the state\\nand municipal governments provides an extensive and time inten-\\nsive set of complex business processes for new RE supply projects.\\n\\nAs we noted earlier, the abundance of black coal resources for\\nenergy generation in Queensland is the backbone of relatively\\ncheap electricity as a fundamental input to a vibrant state economy\\n[36,37]. In-line with earlier studies, responses suggest that the\\nabsence of pricing carbon pollution into electricity is seen as\\na barrier to the delivery of capital intensive RE projects [33]. In\\naddition, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations also argued that the\\nlack of RE information services and targeted education and\\n\\n\\x0c124\\n\\nN.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127\\n\\nawareness programs for businesses and consumers continues to\\nhinder expanded RE supply.\\n\\nTable 4\\nBuilding RE supply in Queensland.\\n\\n5.2. The issue of state-level RETs\\n\\nOver 57 per cent of ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations who\\ncommented on the issue of state-level RETs argued that the\\nQueensland government should maintain its current QREP target,\\nand remain wholly consistent with the national RET [2,40]. The\\nprincipal argument for maintaining this target was to ensure that\\nthe lowest cost solutions (projects) for RE supply were obtained\\nover the immediate and longer term (i.e. no distorted, higher cost\\nRE project approvals in order to meet regional or location based\\ntargets). As an example, power ﬁrm Origin Energy typiﬁed this\\nposition in their inquiry submission:\\n\\n“Origin does not recommend that the Queensland Government set\\na state speciﬁc obligation target around renewables. The main\\nreason for this position is that there should be no distortion of the\\nnational RET. The building of the renewable generation ﬂeet should\\nnot be artiﬁcially forced into speciﬁc geographical locations (or\\nspeciﬁc technologies) by the introduction of a Queensland target, as\\nit will increase costs to customers” (Origin Energy, 30 June 2010).\\n\\nImportantly, the majority of ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations\\nasserted that all RE supply projects should be based on an\\neconomically sound and responsible business case.\\n\\nIn other minority views, approximately 13 per cent of responses\\nsuggested that the state government should support community\\ndevelopment through the application of regional based RETs (e.g.\\n20 per cent RE supply for seaboard (current grid) communities, and\\n50 per cent renewable energy supply for remote communities, by\\n2020); while another 13 per cent argued that improved sustain-\\nability outcomes required more challenging state-level RETs\\nranging from 23 to 40 per cent RE supply for Queensland by 2020.\\nIn these cases, ﬁrms and organizations argued that RETs and\\nprojects should be largely focused on regional and sustainable\\ndevelopment in Queensland.\\n\\n5.3. Building renewable energy supply e Regional policies and\\nactions\\n\\nFirms and stakeholder organizations identiﬁed seven major\\nareas of activity that might increase RE supply in Queensland. A\\nsummary of the policies and actions, covering 88 per cent of all\\nresponses, are presented in Table 4.\\n\\nRE ﬁnance activities and actions attracted the highest level of\\nattention from ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations. In particular,\\nﬁnancial incentives in the form of a large commercial scale gross FiT\\nand suitable tax breaks (e.g. accelerated asset depreciation, goods\\nand services tax rebates) to support large to medium RE asset\\ninvestments, were seen as attractive mechanisms for increasing the\\nnumber of RE supply projects and initiatives. Robust FiT structures\\nhave been identiﬁed as important ﬁnancial\\nincentives for RE\\ninvestments [58]. As an example, solar PV and hot water ﬁrm The\\nSolar Guys argued for the implementation of a large commercial\\nscale gross solar FiT:\\n\\n“Intelligent, long-term incentive mechanisms like feed-in tariffs\\nhave been poorly implemented. A case in point is the Queensland\\nSolar Bonus Scheme e an instantaneous net solar feed-in tariff\\nscheme. A problem with the Queensland Solar Bonus Scheme is that\\nit doesn’t allow large consumers of power to participate and is\\neffectively limited to residential and light commercial customers.\\nQueensland government actions - establish a commercial and\\nindustrial gross solar feed-in tariff” (The Solar Guys, 28 June 2010).\\n\\nPolicies and actions\\n\\nFinance\\n\\ne Financial incentives\\ne Project ﬁnance support/grants\\ne Facilitate power purchase agreements\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\ne Network enhancements and upgrades\\ne Remote grid extensions\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\ne Streamline planning and approvals\\ne Land access and use legislation\\n\\nCommunity developments\\n\\ne RE districts and zones\\ne Community ownership\\ne Off-grid systems\\ne Service delivery obligations\\n\\nTechnical\\n\\ne Technology R&D funding\\ne Skilled workforce development\\n\\nEconomic\\n\\ne RE investment policy\\ne Carbon price legislation\\n\\nNo. of statements\\n\\n45\\n\\n23\\n\\n23\\n\\n20\\n\\n15\\n\\n13\\n\\nInformation, education, and awareness\\nTotal\\n\\n12\\n151\\n\\nOne of the difﬁculties facing the Queensland government,\\nshould it seek to act on the issue of taxation, is that the federal\\ngovernment’s Australian Taxation Ofﬁce retains overall responsi-\\nbility for business taxation law drafting and implementation [59].\\nAccordingly, this type of ﬁnancial incentive would require cross-\\njurisdictional legal consultations and approvals [4]. Also, while\\nthe state government is providing over A$200 million in grants and\\nfunding for various RE supply projects, responses suggest that this\\nlevel of commitment needs to be increased in order to meet the\\ndesired QREP outcomes. As noted earlier, the high costs associated\\nwith RE projects in remote parts of Queensland would dictate this\\nas a prudent action [35].\\n\\nAs a further measure, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations\\nasserted that the state government should take a more active role\\nin facilitating PPAs for RE developments. In the current process, the\\nQueensland government does not involve itself in any commercial\\nbargaining or negotiations between the state-owned electricity\\ngeneration (e.g. CS Energy, Stanwell Corporation) and retail (e.g.\\nEnergex, Ergon Energy) companies and prospective RE developers\\n[57]. In essence, as in other studies, state government involvement\\nwith PPA negotiations may smooth and increase the velocity of the\\ndevelopment process [60].\\n\\nWhile high voltage network enhancements and remote grid\\nconnections were identiﬁed by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations\\nas important actions for RE supply, current and future planning\\nshows that Powerlink, the Queensland government-owned, high\\nvoltage electricity transmission network service provider, has\\nallocated approximately A$250 million for eleven electricity\\nnetwork replacement\\n(substation and transformer\\nrenewals on the 275 kV backbone and smaller 132 kV links) over\\n2013e2017 [61]. In addition, two of sixteen proposed network\\nconnections for the period 2013e2017 will service RE generation\\nplants in more remote locations (a proposed far northern\\nQueensland wind farm and the Solar Dawn 250 MW solar and gas\\nhybrid plant in western Queensland) [61]. We also found that in the\\n\\nactions\\n\\n\\x0cN.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127\\n\\n125\\n\\nretail electricity network, Energex and Ergon Energy are spending\\nA$15.6 billion over 2010e2015 to reinforce and increase the\\ncapacity of the local distribution networks [62,63]. While recent\\nstudies have highlighted the importance of grid reinforcement and\\nconnections to RE supply, we acknowledge that future network\\nreinforcement, connections and capacity enhancements will be\\ndependent on the location of generation plants, and the economic\\nviability of the proposed network upgrade [64].\\n\\nThe suggestion by ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations to\\nreview and reform the RE planning and approvals process has\\nsigniﬁcant merit. In a typical response, infrastructure developer\\nTransﬁeld Holdings made this point in their submission:\\n\\n“Transﬁeld agrees with the broad selection of actions the Queens-\\nland Government could take to encourage investment in the\\ngeneration and cogeneration of electricity from renewable energy\\nsources. We would encourage the Committee to implement regu-\\nlatory reforms to cut red tape for renewable energy projects\\nincluding the streamlining local government approval processes”\\n(Transﬁeld Holdings, 30 June 2010).\\n\\nThe difﬁculty facing prospective RE developers is that genera-\\ntion plants must comply with three different layers of planning\\nlegislation [40]. As an example, renewable energy supply projects\\nmust comply with the federal Environment Conservation and\\nBiodiversity Conservation Act\\n(1999), while also maintaining\\ncompliance with the state’s Integrated Planning Act (1997), Envi-\\nronmental Protection Act (1994) and Electricity Act (1994). Further\\nseparate municipal council land-use regulations and approvals are\\nalso applicable to RE projects. In response to these identiﬁed\\nimpediments, the state government is moving to improve the\\nregulatory framework through its ‘Green Door’ initiative that uses\\nan integrated development assessment system to screen and\\nanalyse the planning, ecological, economic and community well-\\nbeing aspects of the project, and fast track the development\\nthrough joint state and municipal council case management teams\\n[65]. In addition, the state has amended the Land Act (1994) to\\nallow lease holders to provide sub-lease access to RE supply ﬁrms\\nand developers [66]. As noted in other studies, these types of\\nregulatory process modiﬁcations are essential for the streamlining\\nand smoothing of RE supply projects and investments [67].\\n\\nDeveloping clean energy communities using RE supply projects\\nwas highlighted as a key action for the state government. Firms and\\nstakeholder organizations argue that the creation of RE districts and\\nzones, community ownership schemes, off-grid systems for remote\\ncommunities, and the fulﬁlment of community service obligations\\nusing RE supplies are critical measures for growing the state’s RE\\nsourced electricity. In recent times, the state government has\\nidentiﬁed some potential districts including southwest, central, far\\nwest and far north regions of Queensland where community\\ndevelopment and services delivery could be progressed using RE\\nsupply projects and initiatives (e.g. PV systems, solar hot water units,\\nsmall turbine wind energy systems) [68]. Importantly, in these cases\\nthe integration of the RE supply sources with the community\\nprovides local control and development autonomy beneﬁts that\\nmay otherwise not exist, particularly in remote communities [69].\\nWhile the Queensland government has commenced funding\\nsome research in the area of geothermal and wave/tidal energy\\nresources, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations suggest that more\\nfunds need to be allocated to RE technology research and proof-of-\\nconcept commercialization efforts. As an example, energy retailer\\nEnergex argued that more state funding was required for RE tech-\\nnology research and commercial development:\\n\\n“ENERGEX would like to see increased focus on the development of\\ncost effective energy storage devices. These devices would allow the\\n\\nintermittent energy output from renewable generation to be stored\\nlocally and then returned to the network when needed (at times of\\npeak demand). This technology would assist in reducing the need\\nfor retail network upgrades” (Energex, 30 June 2010).\\n\\nWe support ﬁndings in other studies that show technology\\nresearch and commercial development funding is an identiﬁed\\ncornerstone of RE supply growth [8,21,23]. Speciﬁc to this study,\\nfunding and supporting RE research and development, particularly\\nin areas of energy storage and relocation technologies, should\\nenable the state to keep a number of resource site and commercial\\ndevelopment options available in the longer term [40].\\n\\nGrowth in RE technical skills was also seen as a key driver of\\nenhanced RE supply. Accordingly, the QREP target of 3500 new RE\\nindustry jobs by 2020 will require a repositioning of some state-\\nlevel employment and training,\\njobs marketing, and tertiary\\neducation programs in order to focus on critical RE skills develop-\\nment [40]. While the target may be achievable in the longer term,\\nthe high growth mining and resources sector will continue to\\nabsorb large numbers of technically trained personnel\\nin the\\nimmediate to medium term [52].\\n\\nFirms and stakeholder organizations also considered that clear\\nlong-term RE investment policies, including the pricing of carbon\\ninto goods and services provision, would bring greater certainty to\\nthe electricity market and support more RE developments (e.g. the\\nQueensland Youth Environment Council proposed a state-based\\ncarbon tax policy to make renewable energy investments more\\nattractive) [44]. In late 2011, the Australian federal government\\npassed legislation to establish a price on carbon emissions, and\\ndeliver transitional and investment assistance to the electricity\\nindustry in order to close high pollution plants and stimulate\\ninvestment in clean energy generation [6]. These shifts in govern-\\nment policy and legislation provide a framework that supports RE\\nsupply growth and future developments.\\n\\nFinally, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations considered the\\ninformation, education, knowledge and awareness\\ndelivery of\\nprograms to commercial businesses and individuals to be important\\nfor RE supply growth. As an example, RE systems manufacturer\\nConergy argued for improved community awareness and education:\\n\\n“The Queensland Government needs to encourage investment in\\nrenewable energy source electricity generation using a rounded\\napproach including community awareness and education to\\npromote the opportunities that the increased use of renewable\\nenergy presents” (Conergy, 30 June 2010)\\n\\nWe note that information and awareness programs have long been\\nchampioned as a mechanism to grow RE supply chains [70]. However\\nin our study, responses suggested that the most efﬁcient way to\\ndeliver these types of programs was to integrate them with existing\\nenergy efﬁciency and savings programs at the state and federal level\\n(e.g. the Council of Australian Governments National Strategy on\\nEnergy Efﬁciency) [71]. In sum, the combination of energy efﬁciency\\nand RE information should highlight the importance of using less\\nenergy while having regard for green and RE resources.\\n\\n6. Conclusions\\n\\nIn this paper, we have attempted to examine and identify the RE\\nsupply growth barriers, targets, policies and actions that apply to\\nthe state of Queensland in Australia. However, in pursuing this\\nresearch we must acknowledge some speciﬁc limitations of the\\nstudy and its method. First, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations\\nwere openly invited by the state government to provide comments\\nand evidence for the inquiry. Accordingly, we had no control over\\nthe selection of participating organizations or their responses to the\\n\\n\\x0c126\\n\\nN.J. Martin, J.L. Rice / Renewable Energy 44 (2012) 119e127\\n\\ninquiry. Second, the study is based on a single state of Australia that\\nis unique in terms of its population size and distribution, economy,\\nand energy assets. Accordingly, while some of the research results\\nmay apply to other similar regions and countries, other results\\nmight not be easily generalized. Notwithstanding these limitations,\\nthis study has made a contribution to our improved understanding\\nof what RE development barriers exist and what actions we must\\ntake to overcome them.\\n\\nFirst, after nearly 14 years of studying the barriers to RE devel-\\nopment and supply we note that many ﬁnancial, infrastructure,\\ntechnical, regulatory, economic, and information and education\\nbarriers still exist in one form or another [7,21,26,51]. Our analysis\\nof ﬁrm and stakeholder organization responses showed that in\\nQueensland, RE supply projects face impediments in the form of\\nhigh capital costs, insufﬁcient ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure\\ndeﬁciencies, shortfalls in technology and technical workforce\\ncapacity, and high levels of complex multi-tiered regulation. These\\nresults suggest that RE developments still have some way to go in\\nterms of solving the socio-technical problems that confront this\\nindustry sector.\\n\\nSecond, while the majority of ﬁrms and stakeholder organiza-\\ntions preferred states and territories to work within the national RET\\nframework, there may be some value in applying targets for regional\\ndevelopment and improved sustainability outcomes. The results\\nshow that some ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations see value in\\nusing RE resources as a development conduit in regional and remote\\ncommunities. Similarly, a further group of responses suggested that\\nsetting a higher level state RET would enable improved carbon\\npollution reduction and sustainability outcomes. In any case, further\\nprecision needs to be applied to the QREP in terms of its RE targets\\nfor installed generation capacity or electricity supply.\\n\\nThird, ﬁrms and stakeholder organizations have provided the\\ngovernment with a broad range of actions and measures to grow\\nQueensland’s RE supply. While some regulatory reform and tech-\\nnology research and commercialization funding has been delivered,\\nthere is still more work to be done in the areas of establishing long-\\nterm ﬁnancial incentives, infrastructure planning and realization,\\nregulatory harmonization across the three tiers of government,\\ncommunity-centred developments, and information, education\\nand awareness programs. We would argue that these actions will\\nneed to ﬂow effectively and consistently over the next nine years if\\nthe QREP 2020 targets are to be met.\\n\\nIn closing, we note that Australia’s clean energy future legisla-\\ntion was passed into law on 8 November 2011 [6]. Hence, we see\\nfurther opportunities to study Australia’s RE industry sector,\\nparticularly during the period following the introduction of the\\ncarbon tax in mid-2012. We consider that the longer term exami-\\nnation and analysis of RE developments in Australia should create\\nseveral new and informative tranches of knowledge.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThe authors wish to thank the Queensland Government,\\nparticularly the Energy Minister, The Honourable Stephen Rob-\\nertson MP, for its support during the preparation of this article.

One of the regime’s ﬁrst acts was to ratify\\nthe Kyoto Protocol, and in doing so, committed Australia to\\nmeeting a greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement target amounting to\\n8% above 1990 levels for the period 2008–2012. Although\\nAustralia will likely meet this liberal target for the ﬁrst Kyoto\\nProtocol emissions reduction period thanks to favourable changes\\nin land-use and forestry, any subsequent reductions will require\\nradical structural changes to how the nation uses energy, which\\neven the government realises is of a magnitude that few other\\nindustrialised nations face (Government of Australia, 2009h).\\nGiven that nearly 50% of the GHG emitted in Australia comes from\\npower generation (Government of Australia, 2008a), it should\\ncome as no surprise that one of the ﬁrst policy initiatives directed\\nat mitigating GHG emissions was a fortiﬁed program to encourage\\nenhanced development of renewable energy capacity in the\\nelectricity generation sector.\\n\\nThe ﬂagship program of these enhanced efforts is the Renew-\\nable Energy Target\\n(RET) which consolidates all state-level\\nRenewable Energy Target programs and legally requires\\nAustralia’s electricity utilities to ensure that 45,000 GWh of\\n\\ntotal electricity\\nelectricity purchases (approximately 20% of\\ngenerated) will be from renewable energy technologies by 2020.\\nOn the surface,\\nthe new RET brings Australia’s renewable\\nenergy development program in line with EU targets (Hindmarsh\\nand Matthews, 2008) and gives Australian renewable energy\\ndevelopment ﬁrms the requisite market window to establish\\nstronger market presence, thereby enhancing economies of scale\\nand the likelihood of\\nrenewable-sourced\\nelectricity.\\n\\nreduced costs of\\n\\nFor wind power developers in particular, the RET potentially\\nrepresents an opportunity to establish a strategic beachhead in\\nAustralia’s electricity sector by capturing the economies of scale\\nnecessary to close the commercially corrosive cost gap that exists\\nbetween wind power and coal-ﬁred electricity. Actual cost\\ndifferentials are hard to pin down for electricity sources due to\\ntechnological, operational and regional factors which cause costs\\nto vary; and peer reviewed sources on this topic for Australia are\\nsomewhat dated. However, as a general indicator of the current\\ncost disparity, data from the Australia Institute in 2006 estimated\\nthat the cost range of coal-ﬁred power was A$31–40 per MWh\\n(megawatt hour) while the wind power cost range was A$60–80\\nper MWh (Macintosh and Downie, 2006). As of December 2009,\\nthe cost of coal had increased by over 25% from December 2005\\nlevels.1 Moreover, wind power generation costs, which improved\\n\\nn Tel.: +65 6516 4844; fax: + 65 6778 1020.\\n\\n1 Source: The Energy Information Administration, Accessed on January 3, 2010\\n\\nE-mail addresses: scott.valentine@nus.edu.sg, valentine@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp.\\n\\nat http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/coalnews/coalmar.html.\\n\\n0301-4215/$ - see front matter & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, it is possible to argue that the cost disparity\\nhas narrowed in the three years since this report was released.\\nMoreover, a recent study by the Australian Academy of Techno-\\nlogical Sciences and Engineering (ATSE) estimates economically\\nquantiﬁable externalities associated with coal range between\\nA$42 and A$52 per MWh while the cost of economically\\nquantiﬁable externalities associated with wind power amount\\nto only $1.5 per MWh (ATSE, 2009). Taking into account these\\nexternal cost disparities, the cost of wind power is actually much\\ncloser to the cost of coal-ﬁred power than market prices indicate\\nand might in some cases be less expensive. As the RET commences\\nin 2010, wind power prospects are positive because wind power\\nhas the advantage of being close to commercially competitive and\\ncapable of immediate adoption (Kann, 2009).\\n\\nOf other promising alternative energy technologies, engi-\\nneered geothermal, solar PV and solar thermal technologies hold\\npromise given Australia’s abundance of these resources; however,\\nthese technologies are not yet commercially viable for wide-scale\\napplication (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008). Geothermal hot\\nin terms of scale\\nrock technology possesses massive appeal\\npotential. Geoscience Australia contends that tapping just 1% of\\nthe energy from hot rocks located within 5 km of the earth’s\\nsurface would be enough to supply 26,000 times Australia’s\\nannual power consumption on a perpetual basis for 2.6 million\\nyears (Clean Energy Council, 2009). However, it is still at an early\\ndevelopmental stage with only one operational site as of 2009\\n(Government of Australia, 2009a). Overall, geothermal\\nis not\\nanticipated to contribute to Australia’s electricity supply until at\\nleast 2015 and even then only at a marginal level due to cost\\n(Government of Australia, 2009b). Solar PV technology is still 3–4\\ntimes the cost of gas-ﬁred electricity (Gurney et al., 2007).\\nConsequently, despite signiﬁcant government support programs,\\nrecent projections estimate solar PV growing at an annual rate of\\nonly 15 MW (medium case) up to 2020 (CME, 2009). Utility scale\\nsolar thermal technology is also at a developmental stage, albeit\\ncloser to commercialization with a 10 MW demonstration plant\\nplanned in Queensland for 2010 (Government of Australia,\\n2009a). As a stand-alone technology, large-scale solar thermal\\nremains an expensive proposition thereby limiting commercial\\ndiffusion to subsidised programs such as the Solar Flagships\\nprogram which earmarks AU$1.6 billion over 6-years to support\\nconstruction and demonstration of\\nlarge-scale solar power\\nstations, with an ultimate target of 1000 MW (Government of\\nAustralia, 2009c).\\n\\nOther prominent alternative energy technologies face non-\\ncommercial barriers that are equally as formidable. Waste to\\nenergy biomass is currently cost effective but growth is limited by\\nthe capacity of Australia’s sparse population to generate and more\\neffectively manage waste. Although on the surface, agricultural\\nbiomass and combustible materials (i.e. wood and wood by-\\nproducts) appear promising thanks to surplus land to support\\nsuch initiatives, wide-scale adoption of these technologies is\\nimpeded by environmental factors which include extreme water\\nimpacts associated with wide-scale\\nshortages, environmental\\nharvesting of energy crops, seasonal harvests which produce a\\nfeast–famine supply proﬁle and competing agricultural interests\\n(IEA, 2005; MacGill et al., 2006; Gerardi et al., 2007). Growth\\npotential for hydropower is limited by a dwindling number of\\nexploitable water sources and severe regulation of water utiliza-\\ntion (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008; Government of Australia,\\n2009b).\\n\\nMeanwhile, research into carbon capture and sequestration\\n(CCS) technology to render fossil fuel technologies as alternative\\n‘‘clean’’ energy sources is still at the developmental stage (Gurney\\n\\net al., 2007). As of April 2009, no functional CCS and power plant\\nintegration exists at an industrial scale anywhere in the world\\n(Government of Australia, 2009h). Furthermore, it was estimated\\nas recently as 2007 that utility-scale implementation of CCS\\ntechnology would increase generation costs by 38–44% for new\\nnatural gas combined cycle plants and 44–65% for new pulverised\\ncoal plants, thereby rendering both technologies competitively\\nuneconomical (Gurney et al., 2007).\\n\\nFinally, despite indications of increasing pressure to revisit\\nexisting nuclear policy, Australia is a nation in staunch opposition\\nto the development of nuclear power. Any policy changes in\\nsupport of nuclear power will likely face vociferous opposition.\\nMoreover, there is evidence that the cost of nuclear power in\\nAustralia would exceed the cost of wind power and even if the\\ncost disparity were negligible, further evidence indicates that CO2\\nassociated with the entire nuclear fuel cycle is comparative in\\nvolume to emissions from gas-ﬁred power stations (Saddler et al.,\\n2007; Sovacool, 2008).\\n\\nIn summary, although all of the alternative energy technolo-\\ngies listed can and likely will have a role to play in Australia’s\\ntransition away from carbon-intensive electricity generation,\\nwind power developers in Australia face an unprecedented\\nopportunity to snap up the majority of business generated by\\nthe January 1, 2010 commencement of the RET, provided the RET\\nis structured in a way to support progressive wind power\\ndevelopment.\\n\\nIn order to effectively support progressive development of\\nwind power, two elements must be integrated into a policy\\ninstrument. The ﬁrst element is that support policies must be\\ndesigned to simultaneously encourage utilities to make the\\ninvestments necessary to operationally support enhanced levels\\nof wind power. For example, in Japan, despite the existence of\\ngovernment subsidies to encourage wind power development,\\nutilities purportedly place undue storage demands on wind\\npower developers due to concerns that the existing grid will be\\ndestabilized due to the ﬂuctuating nature of wind power\\n(Englander, 2008). Although wind developers are keen to take\\nadvantage of government inducements to sell wind power into\\nthe existing system,\\nJapanese utilities are not making the\\ninvestments necessary to support a progressive presence of wind\\npower (Valentine, in press). The second element is that any\\nsupport policies must encourage wind power developers to\\ncommit the investment necessary to render wind power com-\\nmercially competitive when the support policy is removed. For\\nexample, in Taiwan, the feed-in tariffs provided to wind power\\ndevelopers are viewed as insufﬁcient for encouraging in-land\\nwind farm development; and as a result, a situation is emerging\\nwherein wind power developers are exploiting only the most\\nﬁnancially attractive sites in Taiwan before moving on to other\\ncountries. Once all the ﬁnancially attractive sites have been\\nexploited, it is highly likely that wind power development in\\nTaiwan will stall (Valentine, 2010).\\n\\nThis study ﬁrst aims to evaluate Australia’s new RET on the\\nbasis of these two elements in order to evaluate the efﬁcacy of\\nthis new program to support progressive wind power develop-\\nment. The analysis highlights a number of ﬂaws in the RET which\\nmay signiﬁcantly undermine progressive development of wind\\npower; therefore, this paper also seeks to put forth recommenda-\\ntions on how to improve the RET.\\n\\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a\\nproﬁle of\\nthe Australian electricity industry and discusses\\nrecent developments and trends in regard to wind power\\ndevelopment. Section 3 evaluates the new RET in the context of\\nsupporting progressive wind power development. Section 4\\nprovides some concluding thoughts on how to improve the\\neffectiveness of RET.\\n\\n\\x0c3670\\n\\nS. Valentine / Energy Policy 38 (2010) 3668–3675\\n\\nARTICLE IN PRESS\\n\\n2. The Australian electricity industry and wind power\\ndevelopment\\n\\nWith the exception of the Northern Territory and Western\\nAustralia, Australia boasts an integrated national energy market\\n(NEM) which was established in 1998 to enhance electricity grid\\nsecurity and provide a more competitive market for the supply of\\nelectricity (NEMMCO, 2005). The NEM which serves about 90% of\\nAustralia’s population (MacGill et al., 2006) is a ‘‘compulsory gross\\npool market’’ in which bids to sell electricity are collected en\\nmasse and electricity dispatches are sequenced according to the\\nprice (Owen, 2009). Australia is the only major economy to have\\nintroduced and maintained this type of mandatory wholesale\\nelectricity trading market (Chester, 2007).\\n\\nAustralia is blessed with massive stores of coal, laying claim to\\n24.1% of the world’s economic demonstrated reserves of brown\\ncoal and 5.4% of the world’s economic demonstrated reserves of\\nblack coal (ABARE, 2009). Consequently, it should come as no\\nsurprise that coal plays a dominant role in the Australian\\nelectricity generation industry. To get a feel for the signiﬁcance\\nin Australia’s electricity mix, Table 1 summarizes\\nof coal\\nIn 2005–06,\\nelectricity generation by fuel type in 2005–06.\\nbrown and black coal accounted for 75.6% of Australia’s\\nelectricity generation (ABARE, 2008).\\n\\nOne energy technology that is conspicuously absent from\\nAustralia’s electricity generation mix is nuclear power. Although\\nnational uranium reserves account for 40% of total economically\\naccessible uranium stocks (Wesley, 2007), Australia does not\\nproduce any electricity through nuclear power. Although there is\\nconsiderable public opposition to the prospects of nuclear power\\n(Falk et al., 2006), there has been renewed political discussion\\nover nuclear power development as a possible solution to CO2\\nemission abatement (Schlapfer, 2009).\\n\\nTable 1 also highlights how important it is for the Australian\\ngovernment to facilitate a transition away from coal. Per capita\\nemissions of CO2 from fuel combustion in Australia are amongst\\nthe highest in the world and 43% above the average for Inter-\\nnational Energy Agency countries (IEA, 2005). Of the 576 Mt\\n(CO2 equivalent) of GHG that Australia emitted in 2006, 47% was\\nfrom electricity generation (Government of Australia, 2008a) and\\nthe vast majority of that was from coal combustion (IEA, 2005).\\nMoreover, under ‘‘business as usual’’ practices, Australia’s green-\\nhouse gas emissions from electricity generation are expected to\\nincrease by 37% between 2004 and 2050 (Gurney et al., 2007).\\nClearly if the new Labor government is to achieve marked\\nprogress in reducing domestic CO2 emissions, a radical realign-\\nment of Australia’s electricity industry will be required. The\\ntrouble is that the low price of coal in Australia along with the\\napparent security that huge stores of this resource provides\\nportends a rocky road for a transition to renewable energy.\\n\\nTable 1\\nElectricity generation by fuel type in Australia, 2005–06.\\nSource: (ABARE, 2008).\\n\\nHydro\\n6.4%\\n\\nGas\\n15.0%\\n\\nOil\\n1.8%\\n\\nBrown coal\\n21.1%\\n\\nWind\\n0.7%\\n\\nBiomass & \\nBiogas\\n0.5%\\n\\nBlack coal\\n54.5%\\n\\nWind energy, as the most commercially viable utility-scale\\nrenewable technology, is expected to be the largest contributor to\\nAustralia’s new RET targets (Government of Australia, 2009b).\\nWind power is rapidly expanding in Australia thanks in large part\\nto former national and state-level\\ninitiatives to encourage\\nenhanced uptake of renewable energy by Australia’s utilities.\\nAccording to the World Wind Energy Association, Australia\\npossessed 1494 MW of installed wind power capacity at the end\\nof 2008, which represents the 14th highest level of installed\\ncapacity in the world. In 2008, Australia’s installed wind power\\ncapacity grew by 83% which was the third-highest growth rate\\nin the world (WWEA, 2009). A study commissioned by the\\nAustralian government in 2005 projected an increase in installed\\nwind power capacity in Australia of at least 7360 MW by 2029/30\\n(Akmal and Riwoe, 2005). This would represent a ﬁve-fold\\nincrease over current levels. However, statistics pointing to the\\nsuccess of wind power development in Australia can be mislead-\\ning because when Australia’s total installed wind power capacity\\nis compared to the wind power potential which exists in the\\ncountry, it becomes evident that a signiﬁcant opportunity to abate\\nthe national dependency on coal-ﬁred power generation is being\\nmissed.\\n\\nWith the exception of Australia’s northern coast, coastal areas\\nthroughout Australia boast average annual wind speeds in excess\\nof 8 m/s (at 10 m) and are considered to be excellent locations for\\nwind turbine placement (Coppin et al., 2003). Furthermore, there\\nare huge tracts of land in the southern portion of Western\\nAustralia and throughout the states of Southern Australia and\\nVictoria with average annual wind speeds in excess of 7 m/s (at\\n10 m) which would constitute ‘‘good’’ wind conditions for wind\\nturbine sites (Coppin et al., 2003). Mark Diesendorf estimates that\\nlong-term wind power potential in Australia may be as high as\\n20,000 MW (Diesendorf, 2003, 2007). Assuming a capacity factor\\nof 35%, harnessing this potential would generate 60,000 GWh of\\nelectricity annually, which represents about 28% of Australia’s\\nprojected supply of electricity in 2020.\\n\\nAlthough the theoretical potential of wind power in Australia\\nis sufﬁcient to provide all of Australia’s current electricity\\nrequirements, there are technical constraints that dampen the\\nprospects of a virtually carbon-free electricity system. The\\nstochastic nature of wind power makes it necessary at higher\\nlevels of electricity grid integration for wind power to be\\nintegrated with storage or back-up reserve in order to avoid\\ndestabilizing electricity grid operational security (Ackerman,\\n2005). As Saddler and colleagues (2007) point out,\\n‘‘currently,\\nthe limitation is not the wind resource, but rather the transmis-\\nsion infrastructure, which has evolved for large centralised power\\nstations’’. Nevertheless, the Australia Institute, drawing from\\ninternational experience with wind power\\nintegration into\\nelectricity grids, has estimated that spare capacity in Australia’s\\nexisting electricity grid can accommodate up to 20% wind power\\nbefore the stochastic nature of wind power begins to pose a\\ntechnical threat to grid security (Macintosh and Downie, 2006).\\n\\nIt might be tempting for critics to argue that the Australia\\nInstitute’s estimate may be overly optimistic given the dominant\\nrole that coal plays in the national energy mix and the relatively\\nlow levels of installed capacity in hydropower and gas-ﬁred\\npower plants which are essential technologies for responding\\neffectively to the type of load ﬂuctuations associated with wind\\npower. However, there is also a counter-argument to such\\ncriticism that the addition of electricity storage technologies or\\nenhanced reserve peak-load generation capacity could enable the\\nintegration of wind power levels that extend well-beyond the 20%\\nbenchmark (Diesendorf, 2007). As a testament to the technolo-\\ngical feasibility of incorporating high levels of wind power with\\nenhanced back-up support, electricity grids in two towns in\\n\\n\\x0cARTICLE IN PRESS\\n\\nS. Valentine / Energy Policy 38 (2010) 3668–3675\\n\\n3671\\n\\nWestern Australia (Denham and Hopetoun)\\nincorporate as\\nmuch as 70% electricity from wind energy (supported by diesel\\ngeneration), with an average wind power contribution of approx-\\nimately 40%.\\n\\nEnhancing reserve capacity comes at a cost. One study\\nestimates that the additional cost of backup generation (i.e. gas\\nﬁred power plants) necessary to allow wind power to reach high\\ncontribution levels (i.e. 40%) in Australia would increase the cost\\nof wind generated power by approximately 25% on top of existing\\nwind power generation costs (Diesendorf, 2003), constituting a\\npremium of only 1–2b per kilowatt hour. Aside from these\\ntechnical costs of supporting high levels of\\ninstalled wind\\npower capacity, there are grid connection costs that need to be\\nconsidered in order for Australia’s wind power potential to be\\nbetter exploited. In many cases, grid connections would need to\\nbe extended into remote areas where the absence of competing\\nland uses enhances the commercial viability of wind farms. One\\nestimate of\\nthe cost of new transmission and distribution\\ninfrastructure is at least AU$50 per meter for laying the cabling\\nand AU$35 per meter for any necessary access roads (Wizelius,\\n2007). This can amount to a 10% or higher premium on wind\\npower project costs (Wizelius, 2007).\\n\\nAlthough in aggregate the economic costs associated with\\nadditional reserve capacity and grid connection signiﬁcantly\\nincrease wind power generation costs at high levels of installed\\ncapacity, there are also economic savings associated with CO2\\nreductions that offset these additional costs. Many of the external\\ncosts referred to earlier (A$42–A$52 per MWh (ATSE, 2009))\\nrepresent real costs that the nation is currently incurring even if\\nthe nation’s citizens have not yet been forced to pay for some of\\nthe more insidious economic impacts that are ineluctably bound\\nto progressive global warming. Furthermore, the ATSE external\\ncost estimates fail to take into consideration environmental\\nimpacts such as damage to ecological habitats that temperature\\nchange will bring because the ATSE projection only considers\\nimpacts that can be economically quantiﬁed.\\n\\nIrrespective of the barriers to full exploitation of Australia’s\\ntechnical wind power potential, evidence presented to this point\\nin the paper suggests that achieving a target of 20% or greater\\ncontribution from wind power is both technically feasible and less\\neconomically damaging than critics contend. A study by the\\nAustralia Institute estimates that adding approximately 5% of\\nwind power to the existing grid by 2010 would only cost\\nconsumers AU$15–$25 per year extra (Macintosh and Downie,\\n2006). The study further points out that if the costs of pollution\\nfuel power generation were fully\\nassociated with fossil\\ninternalized, the additional costs (including generation cost\\ndisparity) to the homeowner would be fully offset (Macintosh\\nand Downie, 2006). These conclusions are supported by the study\\ninto the externalities associated with coal by Australian Academy\\nof Technological Sciences and Engineering, referred to earlier\\n(ATSE, 2009).\\n\\nIn terms of assessing the impact that a 20% or greater\\nelectricity supply contribution from wind power would make to\\nCO2 abatement in Australia, the New South Wales government\\nestimates that each MWh of power produced by wind farms can\\ndisplace 0.929 tons of CO2 which would otherwise be generated\\nthrough coal-ﬁred generators (Macintosh and Downie, 2006).\\nEmploying this metric, if wind were to supply the 45,000 GWh of\\nelectricity which is projected to account for 20% of the electricity\\nsupply in 2020, wind power would displace approximately 42\\nmillion tons of CO2, which represents a 16% reduction of 2006\\nnational CO2 emissions attributed to electricity generation.\\n\\nIn symbiotic fashion,\\n\\nthree notable developments have\\nappeared in the policy sphere to indicate that a path is being\\ncreated for encouraging greater uptake of wind power in\\n\\nAustralia. First, over the past decade, Australia’s state-owned\\nelectricity grids have been integrated to form a national grid (the\\nNEM). Now, all regions except for the state of Western Australia\\nand the Northern Territory have interconnected electricity grids\\n(Owen, 2009). For wind energy, grid inter-connectivity delivers a\\nnumber of notable beneﬁts. For example, an interconnected\\nelectricity grid allows states to integrate higher levels of wind\\npower without the risk of stochastic ﬂows destabilizing the grid\\n(Ackerman, 2005). It also allows wind farms to be geographically\\ndispersed which further dampens the adverse effect of wind\\nintermittency (Coppin et al., 2003). Second, the market liberal-\\nization initiatives that accompanied grid inter-connection have\\nsigniﬁcantly improved the prospects for wind energy developers\\nto sell energy into the grid (Owen, 2009). Third, the RET artiﬁcially\\nenhances market prospects by mandating enhanced purchases of\\nelectricity generated from renewable technologies. Given that a\\nbill for a new CO2 emission trading system – the CPRS (Carbon\\nPollution Reduction scheme) – which the government sought to\\nimplement in conjunction with the RET was defeated in Parlia-\\nment, the RET is currently the centerpiece of the government\\nstrategy to facilitate a transition to renewable energy. Accord-\\ningly, assessing the pros and cons of this legislation warrants\\nfurther attention.\\n\\n3. The efﬁcacy of the RET for supporting wind power\\ndevelopment\\n\\nThe Renewable Energy Target (RET) announced in August\\n2009 builds on the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET)\\nprogram of 2001 which aimed to encourage 9500 GWh of\\nelectricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2010\\n(Government of Australia, 2009e). This MRET target was pre-\\nmaturely achieved in 2006 (Kann, 2009). As mentioned earlier,\\nthe new RET aims to encourage 45,000 GWh of electricity\\ngeneration from renewable sources by 2020 and consolidates all\\nexisting state and territory renewable energy schemes into a\\nsingle national scheme which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the planning\\nprocess for renewable energy developers (COAG, 2009). Moreover,\\nthe 2009 amendment increases the penalty levied on electricity\\nretailers who fail to reach their 20% quota of renewable electricity\\nsales from A$40 to A$65 (Government of Australia, 2009f).\\nThis penalty is not tax deductible (Gerardi et al., 2007); therefore,\\nthe punitive value of this penalty to the ﬁrm is approximately\\nA$90 (Government of Australia, 2009g), which serves as a robust\\nincentive for electricity providers to meet their quotas. On the\\nsurface, the RET appears to be a bold initiative that places\\nAustralia’s climate change response efforts on equal footing as\\nthat of the EU, both aiming to ensure that 20% of electricity\\ngenerated will be delivered via renewable energy technologies by\\n2020 (Hindmarsh and Matthews, 2008). However, there are four\\nspeciﬁc features of the RET that indicate it may under-deliver\\nboth in terms of meeting its intended goal of\\nfacilitating\\n45,000 GWh of renewable energy generation and encouraging\\nenhanced commercial viability of wind power.\\n\\nThe ﬁrst feature of concern relates to the treatment of waste coal\\nmine gas. When the government was designing the RET program, it\\ndid so under the assumption that the CPRS would also be legislated\\nand the RET would gradually be phased out. Under this assumption,\\nthe government agreed to a political concession to allow waste coal\\nmine gas (WCMG) to be included in the RET as an ‘‘eligible energy\\nsource’’ to differentiate it from the ‘‘renewable energy sources’’. The\\nconcession allows WCMG-ﬁred power plants to apply to obtain\\nrenewable energy credits (REC) for electricity generated using this\\nfuel source. The government capped the number of RECs available\\nto WCMG projects (at 425 GWh in 2011 and 850 GWh every year\\n\\n\\x0c3672\\n\\nS. Valentine / Energy Policy 38 (2010) 3668–3675\\n\\nARTICLE IN PRESS\\n\\nfrom 2012–2020) and increased the aggregate RET by these\\namounts to avoid eroding the market for RECs attached to\\nrenewable energy projects (Government of Australia, 2009d).\\nUnfortunately, there is a ﬂaw with this treatment of WCMG in\\nthe absence of a CPRS. WCMG is a by-product of the coal mining\\nprocess. Accordingly, any wholesale price of captured WCMG that\\nis above the marginal cost of capture represents additional proﬁts\\nto coal mining ﬁrms. If WCMG were not included in the RET\\nmandatory purchase program, it is unlikely that there would be\\nmuch proﬁt in capture for sale of WCMG because the cost of capture\\nmakes the technology commercially unattractive. However, in the\\npresence of a mandatory purchase program, WCMG can be\\ncaptured and sold at a proﬁt. In short, the policy as it now stands\\nis a form of subsidy to coal mining ﬁrms which if passed on through\\nthe coal value chain will reduce the cost of coal and widen the\\ngap between the costs of coal-ﬁred power and wind power.\\nAny progress made during the course of the RET in closing the\\neconomic divide between the costs of coal-ﬁred power and wind\\npower will potentially be usurped by proﬁts accruing to the coal\\nmining industry as a result of WCMG capture for sale. It also\\nincentivizes the commercialization of a technology that is far\\nfrom a clean energy source because methane combusted for\\nelectricity generation produces CO2 emissions. This subsidy to\\nWCMG power facilities along with a proposed AU$270 million ‘‘Coal\\nSector Adjustment Fund’’ which the government proposes\\nestablishing within the Climate Change Action Fund to provide\\nfunding for coal sector abatement projects and capital grants\\n(Government of Australia, 2009c), represents a level of ﬁnancial\\nassistance to a dirty energy source that should be taxed rather than\\nsubsidised.\\n\\nA second feature of concern related to the RET involves the\\nduration of the program. As it stands now, the program is\\ndesigned to expire in 2030 with annual targets ﬁxed in the\\nmanner outlined in Table 2 (Government of Australia, 2009f). The\\nrenewable energy targets increase steadily over the ﬁrst decade to\\nreﬂect a cumulative increase in installed capacity. To illustrate,\\nthe annual target of 14,400 GWh in 2011 conceptually consists\\nof 12,500 GWh of pre-existing renewable energy generation\\nand 1900 GWh of new generation to be added in 2011. Accom-\\nmodation is made for adding annual capacity up to 2020 when the\\nannual target of 45,000 GWh of total generation is slated to be\\nmet. No additional capacity has been targeted beyond 2020\\nbecause the CPRS was expected to be enacted at the same time as\\nthe RET and it was felt that emissions trading under the CPRS\\nwould become robust enough to level the technological playing\\nﬁeld and render the RET moot (COAG, 2008; Government of\\nAustralia, 2008b). Unfortunately the CPRS Bill was defeated in\\nParliament and this has signiﬁcantly weakened the efﬁcacy of the\\nRET as originally planned. As it now stands, in the ﬁnal 10 years\\nof the RET program, there will be diminished incentive for\\nelectricity retailers to add additional renewable energy capacity\\nbeyond that which was established in the ﬁrst ten-year period.\\nBarring any amendments to this target post-2020 or the imple-\\nmentation of other CO2 emission reduction policies, one can\\nexpect a signiﬁcant drop-off in renewable energy growth once the\\ntarget of 45,000 GWh of generation is reached (cf. IEA, 2005).\\nAn additional complication arising from the manner in which the\\ntargets have been laid out over the 20-year period is that there\\n\\nTable 2\\nAnnual generation targets under Australia’s RET.\\nSource: Council of Australian Governments, 2009.\\n\\nlikely be heavy competition amongst renewable energy\\nwill\\ndevelopers in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of\\nthe scheme because\\nestablishing renewable technology capacity in the early years of\\nthe program ensures that renewable energy developers will be\\nable to compete for 15–20 years of guaranteed purchases.\\nLong-term revenue earning capability is essential to renewable\\nenergy developers who typically extend debt ﬁnancing and\\namortize investments over 15-year periods (Gerardi et al., 2007;\\nWizelius, 2007). Conversely,\\nrenewable energy developers\\nbidding for the 4600 GWh of new electricity supply between\\n2019–2020 will only have 10 years of certain business prospects\\nbefore the program expires. Consequently, assuming there is no\\nemergent supplemental policy to regulate GHG emissions, one\\ncan anticipate reduced competition for renewable energy sales in\\nthe latter part of the program and; therefore, comparatively\\nhigher renewable sales prices. In short, the current structure of\\nthe RET works counter to the goal of encouraging an acceleration\\nof renewable energy demand to support the economies of scale\\nto facilitate further reductions in renewable energy prices.\\nIt supports the process half way and then allows the market to\\ndrop out.\\n\\nA third feature of concern relates to a multiplier scheme\\nestablished to support small electricity generators. Essentially\\nunder this mechanism, renewable electricity credits produced by\\nsmall-scale (rated output under 1500 KW) solar PV, solar thermal\\n(water), wind and hydro electricity systems will be multiplied by\\na pre-established ’’multiplier’’ for electricity output as outlined in\\nTable 3 (Government of Australia, 2009f). Under this system,\\n10 MWh of electricity generated by an approved small-scale\\ntechnology will receive REC credit for 50 MWh of generation,\\nthereby reducing the RET pool by that inﬂated amount. In short,\\nthe program creates phantom credits that exaggerate the real\\namount of renewable electricity generated. Moreover, although\\nthis will catalyze robust sales in early years for solar thermal\\nheaters and household-scale electricity generators, the added\\ncompetition from small generators might be signiﬁcant enough to\\nimpair the development of utility-scale renewable electricity\\nprojects during the 2010–2015 period, which is speciﬁcally when\\nwind power and other larger utility-scale developments need to\\nbe initialized in order to provide 10–15-years of revenue to allow\\ndevelopers to proﬁtably amortize investments.\\n\\nFinally, as a fourth feature of concern, the strategic decision to\\ndesign a capped target system for renewable energy as opposed\\nto offering renewable energy developers a feed-in subsidy or\\nproduction tax credit\\nfor unlimited amounts of electricity\\ngenerated is arguably a questionable strategy if the goal is to\\nnurture the emergence of a commercially viable domestic\\nrenewable energy industry. For wind power developers to be\\nsuccessful in any given market over a sustained period, two things\\nmust exist. First, the wind power developers must be able to make\\n\\nTable 3\\nAustralia’s multiplier system for small generation units.\\nSource: Council of Australian Governments, 2009.\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016 Onwards\\n\\nMultiplier\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\nNo multiplier\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021–2030\\n\\nAnnual target (GWh)\\n\\n12,500\\n\\n14,400\\n\\n16,300\\n\\n18,200\\n\\n20,100\\n\\n22,000\\n\\n26,600\\n\\n31,200\\n\\n35,800\\n\\n40,400\\n\\n45,000\\n\\n45,000\\n\\n\\x0cARTICLE IN PRESS\\n\\nS. Valentine / Energy Policy 38 (2010) 3668–3675\\n\\n3673\\n\\na proﬁt in order to support the type of investment (i.e. capital\\ninvestment, R&D initiatives, capacity expansion, etc.) that is\\nessential for reducing future costs and enhancing the long-term\\ncommercial viability of wind power. Second, revenue ﬂows need\\nto be cumulative, the current year’s revenues building on past\\nyears. This provides wind power developers with increasing\\neconomies of scale which further help reduce costs and further\\nenhance the long-term commercial viability of wind power.\\nUnder a capped target system, especially one with relatively mild\\ntargets at the front-end such as that exhibited by the RET, neither\\nof these two criteria are likely to be met. First, wind power\\ndevelopers will see proﬁts squeezed by heated competition in the\\nthermal water heaters\\nearly years (with small-scale solar\\ncomplicating the competitive mix); and therefore, wind devel-\\nopers will have diminished capacity to ﬁnance capital expendi-\\ntures and other investments to stimulate cost reduction. Second,\\nthe capped target system disrupts revenue ﬂow predictability and\\nundermines strategic planning. Under the RET, unless there is a\\ndrastic change in market economies or additional policies to\\nsupport a transition to renewable energy, it is likely that market\\ndemand for new renewable energy capacity will diminish in 2020.\\nThis means that established wind power ﬁrms that have gained\\nmomentum over 10 years of progressive revenue increases will\\nsuddenly ﬁnd themselves mired in a contracting market with the\\nbulk of revenue being provided by an asset base is gradually aging\\ntoward obsolescence.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nImproving the RET\\n\\nMethods for improving the RET will differ depending on\\nwhether or not an effective emission trading scheme (ETS) is\\neventually enacted.\\n\\nThe four weaknesses of the current RET which were outlined\\nearlier could be offset by the beneﬁts a robust cap and trade\\nregime can provide. First, the ﬁnancial beneﬁts to the coal\\nindustry that the waste coal mine gas (WCMG) subsidy provides\\nwould be signiﬁcantly minimised if the WCMG project developers\\nhad to purchase CO2 emission permits and still generate WCMG-\\nﬁred power at competitive rates. Second, an ETS that effectively\\ntaxes CO2 emissions would level the competitive playing ﬁeld\\nbetween coal-ﬁred power and wind power and enhance long-\\nterm revenue prospects for wind power that extend beyond the\\nduration of\\nthe small generator multiplier\\nintended to give a boost to small-scale technologies would be\\nless of a threat to wind power market development because the\\nbusiness lost to small-scale generators in early years would be\\ncompensated for through business taken away from carbon-\\nintensive power plants in ensuing years (once the multiplier\\nprogram expires) as the electricity industry evolves in response to\\nthe positive market signals that an ETS would convey. Finally, the\\ncap of 45,000 GWh would no longer be an issue of concern\\nregarding progressive wind power market growth because once\\nthe ETS begins to reﬂect international values for CO2 emissions\\ncredits (as the Australian CPRS was intended to achieve), wind\\n\\nthe RET. Third,\\n\\nTable 4\\nProposed renewable energy capacity targets post-2020.\\n\\npower would become cost competitive and render the RET cap\\nmoot. In summary, under a scenario which includes enactment of\\nan effective ETS, the RET as it now stands is sufﬁcient for\\nsupporting wind power development.\\n\\nObviously, this presupposes that any ETS (such as the CPRS)\\nwould set annual emission ceilings at a level that would signiﬁcantly\\nalter the comparative costs of electricity sources. A weak cap and\\ntrade system would do little to level the competitive playing ﬁeld in\\nthe manner necessary to provide wind developers with long-term\\nmarket growth prospects. Indications are that the proposed CPRS is\\ndesigned to be an aggressive program under which annual permits\\nwould be restricted over time to achieve the national 60% GHG\\nreduction target (based on 2000 levels) by 2050 (Government of\\nAustralia, 2008b). This implies a robust program where the value of\\ncarbon credits would substantially increase the overall cost of fossil\\nfuel-based electricity and signiﬁcantly alter market dynamics.\\n\\nIn a ‘‘business as usual’’ scenario where an effective ETS is not\\nenacted, the RET is not currently sufﬁcient to improve commercial\\nviability of wind power. As such, all four of the weaknesses\\nidentiﬁed earlier need to be amended.\\n\\nFirst, if the goal is to wean the nation off a dependence on\\ncoal-ﬁred electricity, the WCMG should not be eligible for RECs.\\nAny part of the coal value chain that is subsidised in this way\\nstrengthens the economic case for continued reliance on coal-\\nﬁred power and makes it harder for utility-scale alternative\\nelectricity sources (such as wind power) to compete on a level\\nbasis. Already, alternative energy technologies face an uphill\\nbattle when competing against coal-ﬁred electricity providers due\\nto disproportional government support. For example, the coal\\nsector beneﬁts from two programs – COAL21 which is a 10-year,\\nAU$1 billion public–private partnership program to ﬁnance\\nresearch into reducing emissions from coal (Government of\\nAustralia, 2009g) and the CCS Flagship program which is a\\n9-year AU$2.4 billion program to support carbon capture and\\nsequestration research (Government of Australia, 2009c) – while\\nthe main renewable energy support program under the Clean\\nEnergy Initiative provides just AU$465 million to be shared across\\nnumerous renewable energy technology platforms. Although\\nother renewable energy support initiatives exist, they pale in\\ncomparison to the R&D expenditures in the coal industry. If the\\nrelease of methane from coal mines is a concern, ﬂaring or capture\\nfor energy use should be regulated, not subsidised.\\n\\nSecond, the government should consider formally extending\\nthe RET program to facilitate a measured expansion of installed\\nrenewable energy capacity from 2020 onwards in order to\\nencourage the scale of transformation necessary to meet the\\ngovernment’s 2050 target of 60% GHG reduction (based on 2000\\nlevels). Table 4 provides a quantiﬁed recommendation in this\\ncontext. If the targets outlined in Table 4 were adopted, renew-\\nable power developers would have a high degree of ﬁnancial\\ncertainty past the 2020 period and would be incentivized to make\\nthe investments necessary to aim for an entrenched market\\nposition beyond 2040. Although it can be argued that such long-\\nterm security can inadvertently encourage commercial apathy\\n(Komor, 2004), Australia’s unique system of pooled bids for\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\nAnnual target (GWh)\\n\\n12,500\\n\\n14,400\\n\\n16,300\\n\\n18,200\\n\\n20,100\\n\\n22,000\\n\\n26,600\\n\\n31,200\\n\\n35,800\\n\\n40,400\\n\\n45,000\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n2023\\n\\n2024\\n\\n2025\\n\\n2026\\n\\n2027\\n\\n2028\\n\\n2029\\n\\n2030\\n\\n2031–2040\\n\\nExtended target (GWh)\\n\\n50,000\\n\\n55,500\\n\\n61,500\\n\\n68,000\\n\\n75,000\\n\\n82,500\\n\\n90,500\\n\\n99,000\\n\\n108,000\\n\\n120,000\\n\\n120,000\\n\\n\\x0c3674\\n\\nS.

The ﬁnal target of\\n120,000 GWh recommended in Table 4 would represent\\napproximately 50% of Australia’s electricity supply and as such\\nthe dynamics of load balancing would likely catalyze coordinated\\ninitiatives to support the most commercially viable renewable\\ntechnology (wind power) through highly responsive technologies\\nsuch as geothermal power (the renewable technology that holds\\nthe most potential for providing peak load supply) and natural\\ngas-ﬁred power. Not only would the extension of the RET\\nencourage the development of two technologies that are key to\\na carbon-free electricity sector (wind power and geothermal\\npower), the achievement of the targets outlined in Table 4 would\\nplace Australia ﬁrmly on track to achieving the 60% reduction on\\nGHG emissions levels (based on 2000 emission levels) by 2050\\n(Government of Australia, 2008b) and position Australia to\\nachieve the type of aggregate deep emission reductions (in the\\nrange of 80% from 1990 levels) that each nation will have to\\nmake to offset the worst impacts associated with global warming\\n(Stern, 2006; IPCC, 2007). Obviously, setting such bold wind\\npower targets would beneﬁt from advances in storage technology.\\nTherefore, the government should consider ramping up funding\\nsupport for storage technology research. This is arguably a more\\nsustainable use of the AU$2 billion in government funding that\\nhas been earmarked for carbon capture and sequestration\\nresearch (Government of Australia, 2009c).\\n\\nAn additional beneﬁt of extending renewable energy generation\\ntargets beyond the 2020 period is that the new targets would\\nmitigate the threat posed by the multiplier system for small-scale\\ngenerators and negate the fourth concern associated with the\\ncurrent RET that a capped target system does not encourage long-\\nterm market investment. Although, under the proposed target\\nextensions in Table 4 a cap is still in place, the cap comes into play\\nfar enough into the future to provide the long-term purchase\\nguarantees (15 years +) necessary to entice wind power develop-\\nments (after the incentivization of solar water heaters runs its\\ncourse) and provides more time to allow research in renewable\\nenergy technology to yield the cost-saving innovations needed to\\ncompete without market support.\\n\\nIn summary, the best approach for the government is to push for\\nthe passage of the failed CPRS bill provided that the CPRS is robustly\\nstructured to force electricity generators to internalise the external\\ncosts of CO2 emissions – at least to a level that parallels notable\\ninternational carbon taxation efforts such as the ETS in the EU.\\nHowever, in lieu of an effective ETS, eliminating WCMG from the\\nRET list of eligible energy sources and extending the RET targets to a\\n2040 target of 120,000 GWh will enable wind power developers and\\nother renewable energy developers to achieve the scale of activity\\nnecessary to support the type of radical transition that the nation\\nacknowledges is necessary in the face of the threats posed by global\\nwarming (Government of Australia, 2009h).\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to the political will and\\ncapacity of the new Labor government to ﬁght the battles\\nnecessary to infuse the RET with the transformational impact it\\nwas intended to exhibit. In the absence of such political will, like\\nso many other national governments in states where wind power\\nis underperforming, it ends up being the governing party in\\nAustralia that is responsible for ‘‘braking wind’’ in Australia.\\n\\nAcknowledgement\\n\\nreviewers at Energy Policy for helpful comments related to an\\nearlier version of this work.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nABARE, 2008.
