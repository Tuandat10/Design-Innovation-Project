But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation’s economic development.

Australia,FMAA,"A large group of economists has backed the federal government’s Future Made in Australia policy, accusing critics of consigning the country to an “extract and export” business model while ignoring the potential for hundreds of thousands of well-paying industrial jobs. The economists and policy experts, from institutions including the universities of Sydney, Melbourne, NSW, Monash, Western Australia and Newcastle, have signed an open letter declaring Anthony Albanese’s $23 billion budget plan represents a chance to rebuild the manufacturing sector and support regional jobs while slashing greenhouse gas emissions. In last month’s federal budget, the government unveiled a suite of measures, including production credits to support the development of critical minerals and green hydrogen, plus direct investment in quantum computing. Key elements of the policy have been criticised by some economists, including the Productivity Commission, as a possible waste of money due to the government in effect “picking winners”. But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation’s economic development. Loading Accusing the Productivity Commission and other critics of knee-jerk responses predicated on “outdated laissez-faire thinking”, the economists say the world of economic statecraft is changing rapidly, which threatens to leave Australia behind. “Australia faces a vital choice. Decades of policy neglect for manufacturing, combined with support (including subsidies) for mineral extraction and export, have left Australia with a distorted and unbalanced economy,” they wrote. “Among all OECD nations, Australia has the smallest manufacturing base (relative to overall GDP and employment) and is most reliant on net imports of manufactures to meet its own growing needs for manufactured products. “This exposes Australia to a wide range of economic, social, environmental and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, powerful corporate interests keep pressuring to extend and expand their extract and export business model.” Among those to sign the letter are the University of Sydney’s Lynne Chester and Bradon Ellem, Monash University’s Svenja Keele and Nick McGuigan, the University of NSW’s Bronwen Morgan and Elizabeth Thurbon, and Australian National University’s John Falzon. In the budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the Future Made in Australia package would help the country become an “indispensable” part of the global economy by attracting investment in key industries and making the nation an energy superpower. The Coalition has attacked the production credits aspect of the package, which offers up to $7 billion of tax support for the processing and refining of critical minerals, describing them as “billions to billionaires”. Several high-profile economists, including long-time independent analyst Chris Richardson, have raised concerns the program will in effect amount to smoking “$100 notes”. But one of the organisers of the letter, the chair of discipline for political economy at Sydney University, Gareth Bryant, said it was important to show there was support for a policy that recognised the changed global economic environment. “We decided to organise this letter to put on record our support for Australia joining the emerging global consensus around the need for governments to actively drive and steer the green transformation of our economy,” he said. “We support the Future Made in Australia agenda as an important step in this direction, but we also want to push the government to make sure it is getting a return on its investments for workers, regions, and the environment, rather than handing out a blank cheque to the private sector.” The economists said Australia had become overly dependent on raw resources that had diverted labour and investment into one small area that led to an overvalued Australian dollar, distorted fiscal policy and added to regional imbalances. They said Australia, without a policy such as that proposed by the federal government, risked missing a “historic opportunity” to rebuild the economy. “We could continue exporting raw minerals (including critical minerals like lithium). But we would squander opportunities to add value to those minerals and develop a more diversified and sustainable industrial mix,” they said. “We would remain on the losing end of lopsided trade relations, selling unprocessed resources to buy back more expensive value-added products (like transmission equipment, batteries and electric vehicles). “Our future prosperity would be jeopardised by failure to seize the economic and industrial opportunities of the global energy transition.”",4.9304

But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation’s economic development. I must also say that criticism is a shortsighted one. The US is struggling with teriff against Chinese imports because the US has not position to rebuild its industry, as its economies cannot cope with such a move. It's too little too late for the US.

However, that's relatively fine for high margin industries.

I'm an electrical power engineer, clean energy accredited designer, and have more than a passing interest in the stuff. We absolutely 100% need green hydrogen.... BUT... Hydrogen hopium is strong but the physics aren't as enthusiastic as the fossil fuel industry backers of it. Without a doubt green hydrogen has a part to play in a zero emission future, but in my estimations it's future will be limited to using it as a molecule and NOT an energy source or fuel. Green Steel may fit into the former. What I mean by that is we will need green hydrogen to replace the approximately 100 million tons of fossil-derived hydrogen that we currently use in the world, for things like making ammonia for fertiliser, and syngas etc. We absolutely must displace these with green hydrogen but it doesn't account for a huge amount of the world's overall emissions so we need to focus on the big pieces of low hanging fruit first, as we have finite resources, finite money, and not much time to keep kicking the can. Hydrogen is NOT a source of energy. It is a STORE of energy. So you have to make hydrogen from something. You can either reform methane (natural gas) using steam (""black"" or ""blue"" hydrogen), or you can use renewable electricity and water to make ""green"" hydrogen. You can burn the hydrogen for heat energy, or you can run it through a fuel cell to turn it back into electricity. The latter being the most commonly pushed technology. This is an awfully inefficient process. You have to convert electricity into hydrogen gas, compress it to a liquid, transport it, store it, then turn it back into electricity. You lose around two-thirds of the original energy context of the renewable electricity. Its also expensive. As a practical example, what this means is a Tesla 3 BEV is 3 to 4 times more energy efficient, and costs around 5 times less to ""fuel"" per km, than a Toyota Mirai HFCV. This approximate benchmark applies to most other applications where people are pushing green hydrogen as a solution to green energy. If we use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries, we will need to generate THREE TIMES as much renewable electricity. This is not small beans. Look at who is backing most of the big hydrogen projects worldwide. Its largely fossil fuel companies. If they were doing it with their own capital I wouldn't care, but they're all seeking public money to do it. Forgive me for being cynical, but it seems like one big bait & switch scheme - sell us the sizzle of green hydrogen, but actually sell us black or blue hydrogen. If it looks like a duck... TLDR: we need to directly electrify whatever we can as quickly as we can, and at the same time building out our grid with solar, wind & hydro. I would say nuclear but I don't think we have time and it's too expensive. But I remain open to the possibility. We need green hydrogen but we need it to replace the existing dirty hydrogen.

The resulting hydrogen is basically free (What else you gonna do with the excess? really, what else could you reasonably do on demand at any time?) Hydrogen is useful as you can; A) Store it for winter energy B) Combine it with nitrogen (Air is mostly nitrogen) = Ammonia Ammonia is an industrial feedstock for many profitable things like making fertiliser, bombs, etc We already handle, store, process large amounts of ammonia, it's fairly stable, can be liquified and transported easily, procedures, policies already exist, CSIRO came up with cool membrane which if you push Ammonia through splits it back into Hydrogen and Nitrogen Ammonia is cool C) Use the Hydrogen in other Industrial process, namely Steel making  Hydrogen is a waste by-product of renewable energy.

Australia,HHS,"There are 2 main elements to energy, electricity and other forms of energy, and each of those is split into domestic and commercial applications. Hydrogen is more associated with commercial applications and is less a renewable energy form, but a store of energy derived from renewable energy sources. But herein lies the dilemma in renewable energy in that its manufacture rate is limited and thus we have to choose whether more of it goes into domestic supply or commercial utilisation. The problem arises if more goes into commercial usage and less into domestic as domestic is largely fed by electricity and that can only be generated by renewable sources or fossil fuel power stations. If we close fossil fuel power stations down asynchronously with demand, there will be blackouts and with less renewable energy allocated to domestic demand, the possibility of blackouts increases; whilst commercial applications will simply continue to use fossil fuels if green hydrogen isn't available, which only impacts on emissions and not their ability to keep operating. Essentially, domestic and commercial demand are competing for a limited quantity of renewable energy production, when domestic demand potentially suffers more from loss of supply than commercial. Green Hydrogen development potentially siphons off more of that renewable demand, leaving less for domestic supply of electricity. The Australian government would do better to invest in more renewable energy on top of investment in green Hydrogen and the best way to do this would be to directly invest in an accelerated implementation of solar panels and batteries on domestic and commercial properties, that can best make use of the energy available and reduce losses by better co-locating generation and consumption, whilst also not requiring additional investment in transmission and distribution systems. It may not be practical to replace domestic gas consumption with hydrogen because of containment issues with existing infrastructure, however, perhaps government could consider development of renewable energy to be used to convert carbon emissions into ""natural"" gas to replace mined natural gas, thus leading to a net zero carbon cycle and not requiring replacement of existing gas energy infrastructure with its attendant energy consumption in the manufacture of replacement electrical infrastructure. It seems a waste to dispose of the energy embodied in existing gas infrastructure merely to replace it with electrical equipment (as it also does in the replacement of ICEV with EV). I think we have to be careful we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater in our eagerness to replace fossil fuel energy with renewable energy.",4.9404
Australia,HHS,"Acknowledging that it is a huge infrastructure spend, we should be going straight to domestic electrification. As you note, it is unlikely we can use hydrogen directly for domestic heating and cooking without a similarly large investment in infrastructure, and blending a tiny fraction of hydrogen into our existing natural gas networks isn't going to make much of a difference. More crucially, the pathway Electrical generation ? Hydrogen ? Domestic heating is very inefficient when compared with using that electrical power directly for cooking or with heat pumps for heating. Hydrogen is not great for grid storage because again, it's really inefficient when compared with pumped hydro (if you have some handy mountains, which we do) or admittedly still immature options such as redox flow batteries. Using the hydrogen to make methane (or ammonia, or methanol, ...) is an option, but still terrible for grid storage and still inefficient for domestic heating. It's going to take a while before we have enough renewable power to be able to afford to waste it at large scale in inefficient pathways.",4.6252
Australia,HHS,"however, perhaps government could consider development of renewable energy to be used to convert carbon emissions into ""natural"" gas to replace mined natural gas, thus leading to a net zero carbon cycle Do you mean extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into CH4?

If you want to extract carbon from the air and convert it to CH4, farming algae and then anaerobic digestion is probably the easiest way to do it",4.6148
Australia,HHS,"Exactly. Hydrogen isn't a fuel, it's a storage medium for energy from other means. And not a good one. It's difficult and expensive to generate, it's difficult and expensive to store and move.

It produces less than 1/3 of what the Korean plant does, whilst taking up about 180,000 square metres and still needing to pull extra energy from the grid. Blue hydrogen is astronomically more expensive to produce and every ounce of power used in its production is power that isn't being used to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy production. It is also super easy (well, relative to when it's used to generate power) for the carbon byproducts of green hydrogen to be re-captured and stored, rather than let out into the atmosphere.

Australia,hydro,"The main argument for H2 is that it can be produced at low cost when renewable assets (wind & solar) are overproducing. The electrolyzers would be a perfect electricity sink. Since many industrial processes (fertilizer is a large consumer) require H2 and take it from natural gas now, renewable H2 production would reduce the carbon footprint of the fertilizer industry dramatically. So much for the theory. The reality is that the electrolyzers built now, need to run 100% of the time to become 'profitable', which is still at way higher prices than natural-gas based H2. With this application, H2 production will be consuming much needed electricity for heat pumps, electric cars and other assets much needed to replace fossil-fuel based solutions. It's competition you just don't want. Also, the overproduction by renewable assets is so interesting (free power!) that many other industries have set up power sinks like e-boilers to consume this overproduction. So the base case is unrealistic and current set-up unprofitable. H2 is needed, for sure. But it won't be viable unless: electrolyzers get way cheaper overproduction is much more common (which means there's much more renewable production) Imo, we should put this tech on hold for ten years or so (longer outside of EU) until the point that we have 60-80% renewable power.

That argument is more of an excuse to get uninformed people to look past the obvious economic problems with green hydrogen.

Australia,hydro,"I went down this rabbit hole recently. Arguably at small scale trying to find a fuel cell large enough to augment my home inverter, and keep a larger amount of stored energy over days, and not a day like my lithium battery. What I found at least at small scale was: The really efficient (95%) electrolysers like Hysata are not available to average consumers yet. I could not find anyone that could even cost a decent fuel cell for me. They are rare at the smaller scale. There are really promising methods for storing hydrogen in fixed applications like metal hydrides, which are heavy, but really efficient, safe, and low pressure with low explosive risk. These are not readily available for consumers though, and very expensive still. Fuel cells still have a way to go in efficiency (<50%) but my use case didn't really care (using my excess solar capacity that would go to waste). My hope was to be able to store a week worth of energy at a fraction of the cost (the fuel cell stays the same size, and you just add tanks). Didn't pan out though, and I think we are a way off still before it becomes more popular. The question is whether it will always be behind battery tech tho? Sodium ion batteries... flow batteries... all of these technologies may actually mature and bring cost down quicker than fuel cells, especially because they are very low complexity (no pipes or compressors). Pity as I would be really keen on having a battery for a 24-48 hr storage, then hydrogen or some other form of cheaper storage even at lower kW for medium term storage (I.e. collect on sunny days and dispatch in rainy days)",4.9552

Most supporters of hydrogen don't look beyond that it seems. It's terribly inefficient to make hydrogen through electrolysis, wasting the majority of the energy. Any other use of that energy is much better. For example, why run a car on hydrogen and loose 70% of the energy, when that same energy can be charging an EV and only loose <20%. Also, there's just isn't enough green hydrogen made, less than 1% is green. The majority is created during reforming of fossil fuels. Which sounds like a good thing, because of it being a byproduct, but it's still requires compression and other things. That means it's, at the very best, twice as inefficient than direct charging.

I agree. Using enormous amounts of renewable energy to extract hydrogen in order to burn it in a power plant and recover only a small portion of the original energy is grossly inefficient. Add to that the fact the cost of an electrolyzer plant, additional renewable energy generation, storage and hydrogen-ready power plant is likely far more than a grid-scale battery or even pumped hydro storage. And to top it off burning hydrogen also produces nitrogen oxide, a harmful air pollutant. This sounds like yet another hydrogen boondoggle pushed by the fossil fuel industry.",2.8968

Australia,hydro,"From the article: Green hydrogen is a much hyped commodity. And the world is full of opinions and lists of what it will, and what it won’t do. And at the very bottom of one well-respected ladder of opportunities is using green hydrogen as a balancing power plant for a renewables grid. Yet that is exactly what the South Australian government has promised to do. It intends to build a 250MW hydrogen electrolyser – 10 times bigger than any other operating plant in the world – to feed into a 200MW hydrogen power plant, which would also be the biggest in the world. Some modelling for how the electrolyser and power plant might work has been provided by Frontier Economics. It is justified by South Australia’s desperate need for new load to soak up the excess power it produces, particularly from rooftop solar in the middle of the day, and its rapidly expanding portfolio of large scale wind and solar. It shows the hydrogen electrolyser (see graph above) will likely operate during the day-time hours when solar – both from large scale solar farms and particularly rooftop solar – is abundant. The power plant will be more flexible, producing electricity at peak times when the price is high. It will rarely operate when the electrolyser is working. “There is no opportunity to arbitrage spot prices if the electrolyser and hydrogen turbine operate at the same time,” Frontier says.",4.872
Australia,hydro,"And at the very bottom of one well-respected ladder of opportunities is using green hydrogen as a balancing power plant for a renewables grid.

South Australia's Hydrogen Action Plan | Energy & Mining It sin't at all inefficient to make green hydrogen using free solar energy that can't be used for any other purpose and can't be used on the grid.

Recently natural gas has become very expensive, and so storage of green hydrogen made from the excess renewable energy on the grid is the plan. Hydrogen Jobs Plan | Energy & Mining After all when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining at the same time South Australia currently has to curtail a considerable amount of its available renewable energy.

The game is simply adding too much green energy sources, make H2 with the surplus then burn it when we need it. You could store enough energy for weeks to months. Batteries give us hours. H2 trains, ships and eventually aircraft sounds like a winning strategy too. H2 has twice the power to weight ratio of Jet A and you can store it in a atmospheric dewar as long as some is always boiling off to keep it refrigerated and cool. 1% a day is all you need. It’s perfect for a fill and go application. Simply running the engine is enough to keep the H2 in a cryogenic state.",4.782
Australia,hydro,"I like to consider myself an ""otherwise-smart"" person (engineer in the renewable industry) and hydrogen is absolutely important for a decarbonized future. I'm surprised your comment got so many upvotes in an energy sub tbh. It's not just an electricity alternative. The Haber-Bosch process is arguably the most important industrial process ever developed (used primarily for the production of fertilizer) and it relies on hydrogen that currently comes from natural gas at a huge carbon cost. And even when it is an electricity alternative, it has an energy density 175x that of li-ion cells. Yes, batteries won the 'format war' for cars, but ships? airplanes? Hydrogen will be important there because of that energy density unless there's some miracle battery breakthrough which seems unlikely. As for cost, green hydrogen is expensive now... but that's largely because it's not produced at scale because there's no demand yet. It also looks like hydrogen is poised to be the dominant 'power-to-X' commodity. In a fully renewable world, there will be lots of curtailment.

Australia,hydro,"I'll start with a throat-clearing so I am not accused of being a nay-sayer or a hater of hydrogen. I'm an electrical power engineer, clean energy accredited designer, and have more than a passing interest in the stuff. We absolutely 100% need green hydrogen.... BUT... Hydrogen hopium is strong but the physics aren't as enthusiastic as the fossil fuel industry backers of it. Without a doubt green hydrogen has a part to play in a zero emission future, but in my estimations it's future will be limited to using it as a molecule and NOT an energy source or fuel. Green Steel may fit into the former. What I mean by that is we will need green hydrogen to replace the approximately 100 million tons of fossil-derived hydrogen that we currently use in the world, for things like making ammonia for fertiliser, and syngas etc. We absolutely must displace these with green hydrogen but it doesn't account for a huge amount of the world's overall emissions so we need to focus on the big pieces of low hanging fruit first, as we have finite resources, finite money, and not much time to keep kicking the can. Hydrogen is NOT a source of energy. It is a STORE of energy. So you have to make hydrogen from something. You can either reform methane (natural gas) using steam (""black"" or ""blue"" hydrogen), or you can use renewable electricity and water to make ""green"" hydrogen. You can burn the hydrogen for heat energy, or you can run it through a fuel cell to turn it back into electricity. The latter being the most commonly pushed technology. This is an awfully inefficient process. You have to convert electricity into hydrogen gas, compress it to a liquid, transport it, store it, then turn it back into electricity. You lose around two-thirds of the original energy context of the renewable electricity. Its also expensive. As a practical example, what this means is a Tesla 3 BEV is 3 to 4 times more energy efficient, and costs around 5 times less to ""fuel"" per km, than a Toyota Mirai HFCV. This approximate benchmark applies to most other applications where people are pushing green hydrogen as a solution to green energy. If we use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries, we will need to generate THREE TIMES as much renewable electricity. This is not small beans. Look at who is backing most of the big hydrogen projects worldwide. Its largely fossil fuel companies. If they were doing it with their own capital I wouldn't care, but they're all seeking public money to do it. Forgive me for being cynical, but it seems like one big bait & switch scheme - sell us the sizzle of green hydrogen, but actually sell us black or blue hydrogen. If it looks like a duck... TLDR: we need to directly electrify whatever we can as quickly as we can, and at the same time building out our grid with solar, wind & hydro. I would say nuclear but I don't think we have time and it's too expensive. But I remain open to the possibility. We need green hydrogen but we need it to replace the existing dirty hydrogen.

The resulting hydrogen is basically free (What else you gonna do with the excess? really, what else could you reasonably do on demand at any time?) Hydrogen is useful as you can; A) Store it for winter energy B) Combine it with nitrogen (Air is mostly nitrogen) = Ammonia Ammonia is an industrial feedstock for many profitable things like making fertiliser, bombs, etc We already handle, store, process large amounts of ammonia, it's fairly stable, can be liquified and transported easily, procedures, policies already exist, CSIRO came up with cool membrane which if you push Ammonia through splits it back into Hydrogen and Nitrogen Ammonia is cool C) Use the Hydrogen in other Industrial process, namely Steel making  Hydrogen is a waste by-product of renewable energy.

WA Is investing heavily into Green hydrogen Generation for use as energy storage and for use in coal free steel in the Pilbara with 800% of our current national energy needs planned in generating capacity. Hydrogen is only expensive because it’s not being mass produced, hey presto mass production solves this. Hydrogen also solves the gap issue with renewable power generation, when there minimal wind and solar generation you can use the hydrogen generated using the previous excess solar and wind to fill the gap until wind and solar picks up again, currently the system would be to fire up more gas in the turbines.

Australia,hydro,"A sad sales pitch to get taxpayer funds into the wrong private hands. Hydrogen isn't economical as other green fuels. Hydrogen has an efficiency of around 30% maximum when compared to electricity EV at 90-95%. No industry is stupid enough to pay 3x as much for it's fuel. It's 3x more expensive than 'green' diesel (co2 offset diesel) The compression and storage systems we have that brittle, rupture and explode trying to contain the smallest molecule in the universe have been working on since the 50's with billions already sunk into it with zero improvements in containment. It still leaks. And it still explodes. Australia has no local advantage in its production (green hydrogen) because all it needs is power and water. Every country has access to power and water. Why make it here to ship it (adding costs to it) when other countries, if it was viable, can make it locally? It's been proven by researchers hundreds of times to be a dead-end technology. The only economic case found has been in the world mandates hydrogen use 100% for industry and 50% for transport energy and then for some dumb reason they buy it from us because they don't have power or water over our LNG export quantities. Heavy haulage has found electric hot swap or carbon offset diesel is much much much cheaper. There's a host of other technical issues suffice to say there have now been a half dozen hydrogen fueling station explosions and some countries have banned it because after independent review it became obvious that it doesn't work. All car manufacturers have stopped plans and dumped tech for mass production of hydrogen cars. Fun fact, the LPG system we have was government paid, and there are something like 1000 LPG cars in all of Australia now. If we sink billions and billions into it, the final product because the economics are so much better in any industry, will be service stations all having a little hydrogen tank that the government has to service using taxes to maintain the 1000 hydrogen cars that get purchased around australia for the next 30 years.

Natural gas companies want to make hydrogen a thing because they want to sell their natural gas as hydrogen. So they propose a bunch of things that literally make no sense like building a national hydrogen pipeline infrastructure to deliver hydrogen to hydrogen powered devices as a temporary stopgap between the carbon past and the clean future.

Australia,hydro,"OP u/Aquatic-Enigma, Hydrogen storage is extremely inefficient. In this new age of efficiency competition for basically anything, no one wants to go backwards! Hydrogen storage has a parasitic relationship to energy we have already made. For example, hydrogen NEEDS energy in order to produce hydrogen. Once that energy is made, hydrogen needs a huge amount of that energy and then less than half of it coverts into usable energy. You need specialized equipment to make hydrogen. It is expensive. You have to be trained on how to operate it. You need a large facility. You need special permits to produce it. You need special permits to store it. You special equipment to store it. It must be stored at very cold temperatures. This costs money and energy. It must be stored in specialized equipment. Over time, the actual hydrogen itself breaks down the equipment. This is called EMBRITTLEMENT. Up to this point in the process, you have lost almost 30% of all the hydrogen you have just made. Hydrogen is really small. So it escapes into our environment, even with our best-known equipment ever made. Let’s say you have a buyer… you need a special license to sell it. Expensive!! The buyer will be charged for you to deliver it to them. (This is passed on to whomever they sell it to) And whoever buys it, needs specialized equipment to keep it cold and to not let it escape. Hydrogen is single-use. It isn’t renewable. Bottom line: hydrogen is inefficient, it relies on energy already made, it is extremely costly just to make, it is expensive to transport, it is extremely expensive to keep stored, it is single-use. And what are you going to use it for?? Homeowners can buy solar panels, an inverter, and a storage battery and literally sell their excess back to the grid. Never another energy bill ever again.",4.9494

Hydrogen storage is only scalable down to maybe a car, to store enough to get through winter from my excess solar generation I’d need another house worth of volume to store it. Rechargeable batteries can scale from a AAA upwards. Where hydrogen production and storage from renewables makes sense is for chemical processing plants that need hydrogen and have access to water and excess tidal or wind energy and other elements they use.",3.2228
Australia,hydro,Hydrogen is exciting for the O&G industry because it allows them to pretend that they're going green. What they really want to do is preserve the centralized production and distribution networks they have spent 150 years making us dependent on,3.5432
Australia,hydro,"Up till quite recently the challenge was to get a clean energy source that would be cheaper than fossil fuels, the attention went towards that. It's only as renewable energy has grown that the question of balancing and thus of storage has gained prominence. Hydrogen is the 'cheap box that's expensive to fill' of grid storage technologies. You use it to fill out the final edge case as renewable energy penetration on the grid progresses towards being concerned with the 'rare event requiring deep reserves'. The requirement to fill this edge case comes after the other options along the continuum of grid storage technologies towards 'expensive box that's cheap to fill' are used (batteries are a good example here). Ultimately most of the energy that ever gets moved in and out of storage goes in the small, expensive box. Most of the energy that's ever stored at one time is in the big cheap box. Grid storage with Green Hydrogen with today's economics seems to become a practical concern at around 70% penetration of variable Renewable energy. Most of the world just isn't there yet. Experiments in places like South Australia will help to demonstrate that yes, variable renewable energy can contra the naysayers keep the lights on economically when the 'sun isn't shining or the wind doesn't blow' & more than their local effect should help remove roadblocks of FUD to renewable rollouts elsewhere.",4.9698

Australia,hydro,Why store hydrogen when you're still allowed to burn natural gas?,3.4526
Australia,hydro,"There rarely is excess energy to begin with. It's unlikely we'll have a lot of excess in the near future, for multiple reasons: Utility companies want to reduce excess because it's profit loss. As a national strategy, it is better to try to use energy when generated, instead of using storage. Trading excess between nations (to be used immediately) is more sensible than storage. Another reason hydrogen for energy-purposes might be rare is that it's more attractive for decarbonizing industrial processes (steel, fertilizer, etc). Hydrogen for energy only makes sense in rare cases, like off-grid locations/military bases. Even then, it will probably not be based on excess energy.",4.8698
Australia,hydro,"Excess energy in Australia is a real thing today with rooftop and grid scale PV. Not likely to go away, the question is will it be stored or put to use (timed demand).

Australia,hydro,"I don't think this is really being done to any great extent today. There's a lot of hype about someday doing it, but it's all predicated on there being lots of excess renewable electricity being made at times and in places where it can't just be put in the grid. I don't think that is very common, and where it is, hydrogen has to compete with batteries which are more efficient and getting cheaper all the time.",4.6124
Australia,hydro,"To answer ops question, there hasn't been much ""excess"" energy available on the grid untill recently. Mid 2010s is the first time I remember seeing it in the news where places like Cali or Australia had too much pv available over the course of a day. Basically the whole grid system and energy distribution is going through a reimagination right now. Instead of burning fossil fuels or running a dam or nuclear turbine at rates humans regulate, we now are capturing solar and wind power at rates and times we can't regulate, so the new question is what do we do with that excess now. ""Excess"" hydro power was indeed used for hydrogen and ammonia production from the 1920s to about the 70s. It got replaced by smr when methane became more widely available. Examples are Rjukan in Norway and the Aswan damn. https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4079/3/2/11",3.9176
Australia,hydro,"Hydrogen is a decent option as a form of long term energy storage for backup power production, and it has many uses in industry for processing energy or as a chemical ingredient. However, excess energy on the grid is unlikely to be the optimal source of power to produce hydrogen since production infrastructure will need a very predictable and cheap input source of power, and competing with batteries to procure a portion of the daily grid surplus is unlikely to be reliable and would probably lead to the infrastructure often being left idle. Thus, I think Hydrogen production will need to be paired with dedicated clean power facilities, allowing very predictable energy levels for appropriate size scaling of facilities.",1.7262

This was passed by paying a lot of expensive oil and gas lobbyists to convince Joe Manchin to define it this exact way. But but but… why is that important?

Australia,hydro,"Hydrogen in its molecular form is not ionized. pH is all about H+-ions, which H2 doesn't form. H2 is not acidic, is not corrosive. H2 is a bitch to store, that much is true, but that's mostly because it leaks from even the tiniest gaps, even completely leaking through some solid materials. You also want to use either extremely cold temperatures or very high pressures to achieve reasonable storage densities. Then there's what you probaly misinterpreted as corrosion: Hydrogen embrittlement. When diffusing through some materials, hydrogen will embed in their structure, making them more brittle. This doesn't affect all materials, only some metals, like steel and titanium. Stainless steel, copper and aluminium are much less affected by this. Composite materials, afaik, are not at all affected by this. The real answer is, we figured storage out a while ago, plus you don't even need to store it, as chemical industry will take the stuff off your hands anyway. What's changing is we're for the first time now seeing an actual economical use case for grid-scale storage, as many countries are reaching the point of 100% renewables at least temporarily. This means there's now free (or basically free) energy available sometimes, which means now is the first time you really want to even have storage capacity available.

Australia,hydro,"Good idea. Similar to what the author proposed in that energy should be used to produce higher value goods for export rather than trying to export energy in the form of hydrogen. “The question is what to do with that extra energy capacity.” Griffith says the answer to that question is to become a world leader in electrifying the primary production of materials from ores, and doing so with renewables. “We have a superpower opportunity well suited to Australia’s natural resource advantages – metal ores and low cost energy. “Steel sells for roughly 10 times the price of iron ore. As a simple example, today we earn around $78 billion in revenue from iron ore exports. If we refined that and exported it as steel, it could make up to $707 billion in revenue,” the submission says “This version of an Australian bauxite industry would be earning $48 billion in exports, three times as much as today’s $16 billion,” Griffith says, although he adds that to do this will require an enormous amount of renewable electricity. “This highlights the importance of boosting our renewable energy production to assume the status of a world superpower,” he says. “That’s really the fundamental argument …up-processing these things in Australia to, maybe not finished stainless steel but at least into pig iron, or into a highly concentrated lithium brine, is absolutely how we should export our energy. “So use the renewables here to do that.

The most notable application is in the production of ammonia as this is the biggest application of hydrogen where it does make sense to witch the supply of hydrogen from dirty to green. Another candidate is methanol. Right now, the biggest consumer of hydrogen is oil refining but refining oil with green hydrogen seems pretty foolish. Another major application of hydrogen, as a chemical feedstock, is in the conversion of iron ore to Direct Reduced Iron, which can then be fed into electric arc furnaces to make steel.

Australia,nuclearpower,"There's another sub on Reddit that has an article showing California went 30 days with 100% renewables. The uptake of renewables with increasing battery storage capacity will make nuclear even less feasible.  We need a truly national electricity grid,  funded by stopping ALL subsidies to fossil fuel mining and production.  And stop the fear campaigns that renewables cause black/brown outs. EVERY year we get the same headlines that ""this summer we're heading for blackouts due to renewables"". That's been about five years straight now, and we've yet to have one. The only blackouts have been caused by both coal and poles and wires issues, and severe weather events.......not by increasing renewables. ",1.8718

Snowy 2.0 costs $12 Billion (ouch!) six times more than planned but provides 2.2GW (not MW) or just under half of Barakah but at way less than half the price. It is a battery that can be charged by that excess solar and wind power. We need more snowy 2.0 or batteries but you can see why renewables are so much cheaper than nuclear. Barakah was contracted in 2009 and started supplying power 12 years later.

Australia,nuclearpower,"For starters, Snowy Hydro 2.0 isn't finished yet; the cost could continue to rise significantly. Secondly, you are ignoring the cost of building the renewable required to pump the water for Snowy 2.0, so it isn't really a fair comparison, given that Barakah does the job of both renewable generation and storage in a single package. Thirdly, where did you get those total costs for Barakah from? It cost $24.4 billion USD in total over the lifespan of the project. Why are you applying inflation to the entire project when it only finished commissioning this year? When you factor in the grid upgrades, storage, lifespan and maintenance costs, renewable energy actually starts to become as expensive or more expensive than nuclear.

Australia,nuclearpower,r/whowouldhavethought,3.0
Australia,nuclearpower,"Im a bit perplexed about stance about nuclear here, so there seems to be two core issues with nuclear power as I see it, the main one is the cost of nuclear plants followed by potential waste management and also the LNP supports it so it should raise some eyebrows automatically. Let's not forget we are getting 8 nuclear submarines, with an estimated cost of $368 billion, so each sub will be approx $46 billion, which equites to 5 nuclear plants per sub or 43 nuclear plants for the entire aukus project. We also have to deal with the nuclear waste here in Australia as there is no agreement from the US/UK. I just think there a large degree of double standards going on, we can't use nuclear power to provide for the public, but you bet we will spend every dollar we have to use nuclear to power our submarines and we will use them on anyone who even thinks they can stop buying our wine, lobsters and coal... While I agree that the cost benefit favours renewables, i dont think we should discount the benefits of nuclear, if we are to get nuclear submarines, then let's develop a domestic pool of talent to manage nuclear power as well. If we're talking purely economic terms, then of course renewables have an advantage over nuclear, but I dont get why everyone here discusses this as if they're an econ major without highlighting we do a tonne of things that is not economically rational, we build car dependent sprawls and toll roads instead of medium and higher density housing and improving public transport, we do everything possible to inflate our speculative housing bubble, we keep coal plants running far longer than necessary to keep jobs, we buy nuclear subs when diesel electric will suffice etc. Not saying nuclear is the right approach but I do worry about the impending climate catastrophe, i dont believe it should be nuclear or renewables, I think both have their parts to play when it comes to switching away from fossil fuels.",4.5818
Australia,nuclearpower,You missed 15-20 YEARS to build one (we need many). The time frame is the key attraction for Dutto and Lib/Nats. Wake up!,3.4526
Australia,nuclearpower,"The reasons for powering submarines with nuclear power are due to operational needs. The point is to be able to have the submarine stay hidden underwater for a very long time. Other power sources can't do that. Diesel electric subs can only stay under for a couple of weeks before having to come up for air. Whether that is a necessary expense or not is a different question, but there is a specific need for that type of power source for that type of application. We don't need power for the Australian grid to be able to be generated underwater for 4 months in a row. So it doesn't make sense to invest a huge amount of time and money in investing in nuclear energy when we can get more energy and quicker by investing in renewables. The idea of wasting a lot of money to build nuclear power plants in order to develop a domestic pool of talent to manage nuclear power plants doesn't make sense, if we didn't need the nuclear power plants in the first place. If you want to waste money on developing skills we don't need, then how about we replace a portion of our digital phone switchboards with manual ones, and then train a pool of talent as phone switchboard operators so that we have that skill handy to operate the unnecessary manual phone switchboards that we installed just so we could have a pool of talent to operate them.",4.8936

Australia,nuclearpower,"In theory, I'm not against nuclear power at all. But there are a couple of reasons I don't support it as an option in the short term we need. That short term being defined by both needing to reduce carbon output and the end of life of existing coal & gas systems. Firstly there is no international capability to produce reactors in bulk or in any form of modular way. Every reactor is designed and built to custom spec. The net outcome of this is that individual power stations are expensive and slow to build. In comparison you can buy off the shelf coal furnaces, boilers and turbines and then just assemble them. If you look at reactors built recently in the western world the time scales of those builds are eye watering. The Vogtle power station is the latest reactor to come online in the US. This was an expansion of an existing plant, so much of the infrastructure was already in place, and yet it took 11 years from the start of construction to commissioning. The second is that we don't have the domestic skillset to build and operate the plants effectively. We have the capacity to learn those skills, but it is a workforce we don't have. This will add into the time to build, and the mistakes that will be made in the build that will need significant rectification. So if you said ""GO!"" right now, I genuinely believe we would be looking at 15 years before the first plant would be online. By which a vast number of our coal plants would have collapsed, and we would have had to build other solutions to keep things running anyway. So we may as well build renewable with hydro and battery storage now, because we can, and revisit nuclear in 15-20 years. Because the French are likely to have perfected a second wave of nuclear stations by that stage as they are about to have almost 50 nuclear plants come to end of life.",4.1148
Australia,nuclearpower,"Because TLDR if they were interested in helping Australian's, renewables are cheaper/faster/superior/better suited for Aus environment/landscape/infrastructure. However the main real reason is that the world doesn't have an answer yet to radioactive waste. We can put it in a concrete box and forget about it for 10,000 years but if the concrete box breaks or while waste is being transported to the facility, or any other unfortunate thing happens in a world beset by climate change powered disasters, we're going to have a bad time, and nobody wants that in their backyard. 'Putting it in a box for 10,000 years' is not an acceptable solution; it needs to be something we can deal with right now. If we could hypothetically convert nuclear waste into something totally harmless and not radioactive at all then the situation might change.",4.1356

Australia,nuclearpower,"There are a variety of reasons but there's one that pretty much makes it (and everything else I suppose) completely unviable: money. It would be such an unimaginable waste of money that even countries with nuclear industries would probably think it's a stupid waste of time for us to try.
Australia has the single most renewable energy resources on the planet with our solar and wind potential alone dwarfing everyone else. Renewables also get cheaper and better faster while being infinitely easier and faster to build.
By the time a nuclear reactor is finished here, renewables would dominate the grid to the point that the nuclear reactor would spend most of its time turned off as it'd actively cost money to sell the power. Any money spent on nuclear fission reactors would be infinitely better spent on researching and developing nuclear fusion instead.
.also, anyone that says things like ""the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine"" or whatever is speaking completely nonsense. Sunlight is relatively predictable, storage is getting better and power demand drops off dramatically while people sleep. As for wind, with our tens of thousands of KMs of coastline and loads of land, it is literally always blowing somewhere. Offshore wind in particular is pretty much always blowing. And, while the whole baseload power thing is increasingly becoming nonsense too, there are renewable sources of energy that are ""always on"" such as geothermal and tidal. At this point, the only reason to support nuclear fission here is ideological. In the interests of the economy, energy supply and actually cheap power, the only viable option for Australia is renewable energy for the foreseeable future. That is likely to change when nuclear fusion becomes commercially viable but until then, renewables it is. Note: I'm not against nuclear fission at all.

Realistically that waste will probably end up in either a rural backwater or Indigenous land, where complaints and problems will be ignored. Although relatively “safe” the consequences of an accident or terrorism are much greater than any other alternatives. It contributes to the risk of nuclear proliferation by conventional or unconventional means. Every nuclear power system in the world is backed by significant state subsidies and special legal dispensations. Provides another opportunity to introduce even more draconian police state laws to “protect” the uranium-nuclear industry. The construction (and decommissioning) of nuclear facilities is extremely long, we need faster alternatives. The cost of operating nuclear power is not cost effective compared to the alternatives. We have cheaper options. We will also need to invest and develop supporting industries, which will add to the costs and timescales above. The alternatives provide more options for community-control, flexibility, decentralisation, and independence. Nuclear feels unAustralian.

It's also pretty clear why Dutton and the Libs have suddenly decided that nuclear is the answer - and it's not remotely genuine. They know the cost will be prohibitive. And they know there is no way they can create the infrastructure of a nuclear-led grid before about 2045.

Environmentally, who knows? When they go bad, it is catastrophic, and Dutton wants to give us seven. On the finances, there is the construction risk: Australia has a bad track record at complex projects that we've never done before, mostly because they are complex projects we've never done before. We are too small to get any benefit from the learning experience either: I'm sure by the time we built the 6th Collins Class submarine we were getting the hang of it, but that's all we made. Nuclear plants cause huge financial problems even for those who have experience at building them, so it's double trouble. There is the traditional financial risk: the opportunity cost. Even if all goes well, they require operation of several decades to pay back the cost of construction and the absolutely staggering cost of decommissioning (because it is a very toxic environment). You get very committed when you go nuclear. But who knows what the future holds? This why business will not invest in this (unless the government takes most of the risk, by providing long term power prices that will probably end up massively more expensive than renewables). A lot of smart people are convinced that even with today's technology, we don't need nuclear. Renewables and storage are young technologies, there will likely be breakthroughs in the next 20 years, let alone the next 40. Nuclear is a big bet against renewables. Given how fast renewables have got cheaper and how fast batteries are getting cheaper, this is crazy bet. The business case for nuclear assumes today's cost picture for the cost of electricity it is competing with, but it is very hard to make credible predictions about the alternative costs so far in the future. It is a gamble. Heck, fusion is making progress. We're going to look pretty stupid with fission reactors at that point. And the environmental risk. They don't go wrong very often, but when they do, it's really bad. An accident like Fukushima would devastate the reputation of Australian agriculture for years. It would probably lead to a mass movement to close down the remaining reactors. In my opinion, there is a military advantage to the decentralised grid we get from renewables, too. It will be a hard grid to break. And if someone drops a bomb on a field full of solar panels, it doesn't cause mass deaths. And where will the waste go? We can't even agree on a place to keep low level waste. Are these risks worth it? No. We don't need nuclear power so why take all those risks? That's the thing. We don't need it. We might need to keep a few coal generators open a few years longer, and use more gas for ten years than some people would hope for. That does not mean we need nuclear, which won't be ready until 2040, for one of them.
Unless the plan is actually to stop the rollout of renewables and keep coal and gas going until then. That is the only way it makes sense, to artificially construct the need for nuclear. So there is deep suspicion about the motives. Incredibly bold call though. So much for the low profile pathway to government.

Australia,nuclearpower,It doesn't sound like you are on the fence. My big concern with nuclear is waste. This is never discussed by the proponents of nuclear. I would argue that there are plenty of discussions on the problems with renewables that you have outlined.,2.2364
Australia,nuclearpower,"I can answer your questions. 1. I can’t answer broadly for extreme events. But all renewable installations are built to a certain risk tolerance, just like a power station. The less risk tolerance, the more expensive. So it’s a trade off. One the reasons nuclear power is expensive is that the stations have to be built to a very very low risk tolerance. Inevitably power generating institutions will go down (as happens to power stations). We all remember Fukushima I’m sure. Renewables are actually structurally (not engineering) more resilient because we rely on so many dispersed installations that losing an installation is easily managed. If a significant portion was lost (similar to losing a whole power station) then the excess capacity in the grid is spun up (and grids always have excess capacity). If there isn’t enough excess capacity built in, you get failures like in Texas where the cold snap stopped the operation of several coal and gas stations. It all depends on the system design. You can have less and more resilient electricity systems whether renewable, nuclear, or fossil fuel. It’s a question of how much money you’re willing to spend on it. In a way. Putting more expensive nuclear to provide security in case say a cyclone takes out offshore into the mix (putting nuclear tail risk aside) is simply another way of trading off cheaper power for more security. In short. There’s no inherit reason renewables are less secure. It’s a question of the entire grid’s design. 2. As for solar land use. There is naturally no solution to this. Your options are to (if you don’t want to cover hundreds of square kilometre of land) is to build more wind instead. Of course we also cover a significant portion of the land in agriculture so I would be more concerned about that than solar. The ANU thinks we need 1200 square kilometres of land. https://iceds.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/no-threat-farm-land-just-1200-square-kilometres-can-fulfil-australia%E2%80%99s-solar-and",1.275

Australia,nuclearpower,"Lets talk waste and safeness, since those are reasonable concerns. Waste: Until we have some sort of mass-scale capture and store, or other replacement for baseline we're stuck with coal and gas fired plants. Coal isn't clean and homogenous, it's a mineral dug out from the ground containing trace amounts of Uranium and Thorium (including their isotopes). When you burn coal you throw all the other elements out into the environment, so if you live within a couple of hundred km of a coal plant you're getting exposed to higher levels of ""radioactive waste"", and radiation, than someone who lives next door to a nuclear plant. And that's on top of the greenhouse gas issues. There are types of reactors that either produce very little waste, or can reprocess spent fuel to use as new fuel to reduce the small amount of waste they make. For what's left ( including the reactor itself) after 40 - 80 years or so of service you can safely dispose of it - it just costs a lot of money. It involves a gigantic hole in the ground and lots of concrete, that costs a lot more so many governments take cheaper / less safe approaches. If we want to go down the path of Nuclear it's up to us to push for safe disposal. Safety: Nothing's completely safe, but with Nuclear there is a lot more effort and cost focussing on safety (similar to the effort that goes into building a plane vs building a car) . That's the #1 reason it costs so much and takes so long. When you look at other disasters that have happened, and potential disasters, they tend to fall into the buckets of: Unstable environment (e.g. Earthquake, Tsunami) - Australia is lucky we have lots of stable places we can build to avoid this Bad design and human incompetence (Chernobyl) - simple to learn from and not use that type of reactor Similar for 3-Mile Island etc. War - pretty stable on that front and lets face it if someone starts attacking us (like China) we're so far away their only option is ICBM nukes anyway. And that's ignoring designs like molten salt that need the salt bath to maintain the reaction so if it blows off the reaction stops - meaning they can't meltdown. So compared to other choices for maintaining consistent load safety wise we have : Lithium battery tech for your house/car - far less safe than Nuclear, far more likely to burn your house down due to a fault (so great a chance many ebikes and scooters are getting banned from high-rise buildings). The safety tolerances just aren't there Coal... already discussed plus the risk to your safety if the greenhouse effect runs away gas-fired. better than coal but still pumps greenhouse gasses out which we can all agree are bad for long term health and safety Pumped hydro - probably the way to go but also difficult and costly, and there aren't a lot of great sites for it (and snowy 2.0 keeps getting bogged, it's starting to look like the only project that will cost more and take longer than Nuclear) Don't forget most of the Greenpeace fear-mongering was based on funds and info provided by shell corporations acting for the Coal and Fuels industries. We already have 1 reactor (Lucas Heights) - it's where most of the isotopes for medical use in Australia come from. By all means look at Nuclear as a poor choice from a cost / implementation time frame (we should have done this 20 years ago) , but you're not being realistic if you think it's bad (or significantly worse I guess) from a safety / waste perspective.",4.968

I think its possible to do it with renewables & storage, but I can see various factors making it either impossible to do or impossible to do without spending a massive fortune on it. I've always advocated for keeping all of your options open for consideration if only so you can strong arm one corporation or another to say you'll walk if you don't get a better deal. But keeping the option of nuclear open is important if things like the solar supply chain grinds to a halt, an entirely international problem from Australia's perspective and a large sovereign risk of solar installations.

However, those figures are contested. A peer-reviewed 2020 study by the University of Queensland estimated the cost would be between $4,700/kW and $9,900/kW. The report says the capital costs would be recovered over the lifetime of the project. Because SMRs only exist on paper, that 2020 study is in large part based on what the NuScale project in Idaho, USA was expected to cost. The problem is that GenCost's numbers are influenced by what NuScale actually cost, when the project blew out so far that it was no longer able to secure enough private funding (despite a heaping of public funding) and collapsed last November.

The reason no one in their right mind is interested in nuclear is the economics are horrendous. New nuclear produces power 300-500% more expensive than renewables. The nuclear power plant recently completely in Finland had to be turned off for long periods as it was running at a loss (ie. couldn't compete on price vs renewables). France with their massive fleet of aging nuclear reactors was a net importer of power from Spain, Germany and the UK for two years running. Even when their reactors are running, they have to sell at a loss or scale down production as they can't compete with renewables. That's why no private capital is going anywhere near it and is pouring into renewables instead. Also, any new nuclear we started now would be 10-15 years minimum to complete. Not only is this too late to make any difference to climate change, but the build phase spanning decades is incredibly carbon intensive and you have to run the nuclear plant for 40+ years to claw that carbon back.

Australia,nuclearpower,"Quite simply because it’s very expensive and difficult to build nuclear reactors. They are constantly going over budget. They only get built now (around the world) when the government builds them or when there are considerable subsidies. This is because of the huge capital costs (and the big risks of capital overruns when not building the exact same model for the 5th time; which is what happens when you upgrade the tech involved to a new more modern reactor type). In Australia. Before a nuclear reactor is even built, an entire suite of technicians and engineers have to be built out of nothing. An entire regulator has be spun up with similar expertise to watch the industry and ensure it’s safe, then you have to create an educational program to reproduce those experts. After that the Australian government and whatever private actors bribed into doing it will have to construct one of the most difficult engineered projects without any personal experience. This all has to be solved by paying hundreds of foreign experts a lot of money to spend years overseeing it all. When it’s done. You have a well of expertise that quickly dissipates (unless you constantly build new reactors and plants). If you’re going to replace the same reactor in 50 years, it’s not far off from starting again contractor experience wise. This is the issue stalking countries like the US and the UK (wherein new reactors are financial disasters). So if you’re willing to put down billions and billions of dollars and a sustained government campaign with imported experts and new government agencies; why not get much better bang for your buck with renewable energy and energy storage? How will it be built in time meet the zero carbon goals anyway? How long will it take to do the policy planning, the training and institution building, the contract writing and negotiations with foreigners, the set up time to get hundred of people in place? 10 years? You know how long the average modern nuclear plant takes to build from the first concrete pour? 20 years. This would mean pursuing an ‘intern’ energy strategy, likely gas. Which economically means replacing coal with gas and then timing nuclear to replace it in 30-50 years (depending on how much of the capital costs of the gas plants you want to waste).",4.9034
Australia,nuclearpower,"I am not against either but you only have to see the evidence of Germany's failure in transitioning to renewables after they shut down their power plants, only to go back to coal after they cut ties with Russian gas.

Nuclear is stable but it doesn't scale quickly at all. Can a renewable only future sustain Australia? The short answer is ""most likely yes"" but that's really not the right question to be asking right now. The right question we need to be asking is: What can we be building right now to replace our existing coal generators, since most of them are scheduled for retirement in the next 10-ish years? New coal or gas generators would be absolutely unthinkable, given the requirement for decarbonisation. Nuclear isn't a real option, since there is absolutely no chance we could have a single nuclear reactor in place before the major coal power stations are shut down. So the only logical solution is renewables and storage. It's relatively quick to build and scale up as required. Costs for solar, wind and batteries are all plummeting. The fact is that we really do not have a lot of options. Nuclear being presented as a genuine alternative is a furphy.",4.7378

Worse yet is that we are supposed to be due for more mega-droughts like the one we saw at the beginning of this century. On the other hand, we have vast areas of Australia ideal for solar power where the population density can be measured in square kilometres per person and thousands of sites that have been identified as being suitable for pumped hydro - if we built out all of those pumped hydro sites we would have enough storage for over 2 years worth of electricity usage for the whole of Australia.",4.9452

Some of the projects are not projected to be finished until the 2040s but it isn't illegal. The reason why Nuclear power is current illegal in Australia is associated with our signing of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty. In a lot of cases the countries that do have strong domestic nuclear power generation capabilities also have Nuclear weapons.",1.1182

The other challenge is that while the government may choose to fund this, for the proposal to remain on track you would need back to back LNP governments with state backing all the way to 2040, which is simply not realistic. Government would need to tap debt capital markets to raise the funds but the major banks, super funds and insurers will need big pricing incentives to account for the governance issues this brings if they can even stomach it at all.

I also don't want to go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole, I would like to see if this can be made to work.

Australia,nuclearpower,"Those plants need to close. The current state and federal governments want to keep the thermal plants running for longer, but the older ones are literally falling apart with tube damage both in and outside the boiler. More aggressive load ramping has accelerated the wear. Going forward plants will probably be brought online/offline to match demand - further causing issues with the boiler and turbine. There comes a point where the operators won't continue to operate their units because the risk of a catastrophic steam leak or other failure becomes too high. If you're running a plant that's expected to close in 3 years, you'll allow it to limp along until that date (maintenance costs are still high as things are failing). Then imagine the government tells you to run for another 4 years - you have to recalculate the odds of plant failing in the period beyond the planned lifetime and fund additional maintenance or upgrades to continue going.",1.062

'The recent history of nuclear power construction in the U.S. provides a useful point of comparison. Only a single nuclear power plant has been completed in the U.S. in the last 30 years: the two-unit Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Tennessee, which required 23 years for one reactor to be operational and 33 years for the other. What’s more, the two most recent nuclear projects under construction — the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant and the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station — received approval in 2012 from the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), and are both over budget and far from completing construction. For instance, a revised cost forecast for the Vogtle plant projects a total project cost of $25 billion, which is a 75 percent increase over its original $14.3 billion estimate.' Solar vs. Nuclear: Comparing Carbon-Free Power Sources | EnergySage and this 'However, the cost of nuclear power itself doesn’t need to be as high as it is in the United States. Japanese nuclear power plants only take an average of three to four years to build, from pouring concrete foundation to grid connection. French power plants mostly took between five and eight years to build. American plants used to be built at a similar pace, before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began to regulate the most minute aspects of construction. Contemporary American nuclear plants commonly take over a decade to build (assuming the construction plan is not simply abandoned). The NRC has a 32-step construction licensing process, and many of those steps require approval from other regulatory agencies that impose their own multi-step approval processes.'

While renewables are considered to be the fastest way to achieve these targets, most people don't realise the following: the time it takes to plan and build transmission systems hasn't improved with the increase in renewable projects. There are completed renewable plants in Australia that were completed more than 2 years ago and are still waiting to be connected to high voltage distribution networks. This is probably one argument in favour of Nuclear, in that there would need to be little additional transmission to replace current coal plants. even if you can replace the electricity generated by coal with renewables, you still need to build 2.5 to 3 times as much electricity generation capacity to account for the shift from hydrocarbons as a fuel source to electricity. This, in turn, increases the requirement for additional transmission even more. renewables currently can't provide all of the Ancillary Services that Baseload plants already provide. You need hydroelectric storage or gas plants to meet that need. globally, there is likely not enough copper to meet the increased demand in the metal due to renewables. For example, a 100 MVA battery bank will typically use 21 transformers (20 x 5 MVA and 1 x 100 MVA) for distribution. A single unit of a coal fired power station would require half to three quarters the number of transformers. On top of this, the entire electricity network will require upgrades due to the increased demand, amongst other applications. In the last 15 years, the amount of new copper reserves that were discovered were about 5% of the total discovered since 1990, in spite of several times more capital investment. In addition, the total amount discovered over those 15 years was close to the total amount discovered in 1991 alone!

Australia,RET,I love the smell of fresh bread.,4.5158000000000005
Australia,RET,"There is no facing extinction global warming bull-dust. It's only a matter of picking a rational option to have cleaner air without plunging the world back into starvation a century ago. We have tradeoffs to choose. Liars talk about zero-emission energy system. No such things as there is no such technology. Every supply chain spills emissions. China produces 80% of solar/wind hardware, using low cost coal fired power. The more you install solar/wind, the more China spills emissions, which causes global emissions to increase every year despite reductions in the West thanks to the latter's switch from coal to gas. A 5-megawatt wind tower uses the same amount of steel, carbon fibre, cement and space as a 500-MW gas fired power plant. Wind is more emitting than gas in full life cycle. You can burn 10 times the capital and still end up with higher emissions as a whole. That's called idiocy or insanity. If you switch from coal to gas, you cut emissions (gas power has half the emissions of coal power) and retain supply chain in the West. Then you expand nuclear power to take over baseload power supply from gas or in conjunction with gas. This is the only way to return to an affordable, lower emission energy supply system with national security benefits. When ppl talk about solar / wind being cheaper than fossil fuel electricity, they don't talk about back-up supply cost. Electricity supply must be 24/7, otherwise it's useless. Solar / wind cannot provide first-world power supply without back-up from fossil fuel supply. As solar / wind average capacity factor is 1/10-1/5 of fossil fuel plant, you must build 5-10 times the plant capacity of fossil fuel to hopefully get an equivalent amount of energy generated by fossil fuel plant. Further, consumers cannot rely on ""average"" capacity of solar/wind. At any time, a solar /wind farm can lose almost all its production due to cloud cover or wind shift. Hence, the grid must have excessive fast-response plant (gas/diesel fuelled) to ensure smooth back-up supply. This is called ""firming"" capacity. The more you build intermittent solar/wind plant, the more you must build gas/diesel plant. This is where you can burn 10 times the capital and still cannot get very far towards net-zero. You can use batteries to do instantaneous back-up supply to solar/wind. But batteries are for storage, not additive generators like fossil fuel plant. You must charge them (while also supplying grid demand) before you can discharge them for back-up use. Hence, you must overbuild solar/wind/gas/diesel even more to do the charging - more capital spend. Batteries cost 3 times gas plant and can last only 2-3 hours, with plant life 1/3-1/4 that of gas/diesel plant so you have to keep replacing them. If your solar/wind system is down longer than couple hours, you have blackout or brownout. No way to run an industrial economy on that kind of power system. To back up solar/wind long term, you must keep building more and more gas/diesel plant. The latter can keep generating as long as there is gas/diesel to run. Superbly reliable. The only technology that can give you such baseload power without emissions at point of generation is nuclear energy. When comparing cost, you must do so apple with apple. To have usable 24/7 power supply, the cost of solar/wind/battery is many times higher than fossil fuel as currently, and also higher than nuclear. If nuclear has the time, commercial focus and government subsidies that governments in the West have thrown at solar/ wind over the last 20-30 years, it will be the cheapest and cleanest power supply system soonest. And the West is self sufficient in nuclear energy. As governments push societies further and further into the solar/wind/battery quagmire, power tariffs at consumer level have kept and will be keeping on rising. There is no escape. You can bring power cost down and build a sovereign (not relying on the China supply chain) system by going gas for next 20-30 years while filling the system up with nuclear energy over time. This is also the most effective way to lower global (Nox, Sox etc) emissions - for cleaner air, not necessarily believing in the humanity-threatening warming bull-dust.",4.747

Renege on the Glasgow and Paris commitments. Looking at more than 3C of warming, virtually sterilising Australia and most of the world. This option lets us continue with todays politics and maintain the current economic market model. This will lead to eco extremism to ramp up, sabotage and terrorism will take place as people take matters into their own heads and hands. A deep, rapid and organised decarbonisation of society. Policy will look different place to place, but policy will be overarching, controlling, and vastly unpopular. Yet, we will be taking international equity and development seriously. Perhaps limit warming to 2C (still apocalyptic conditions). But we may start the road to a real zero future (pie in the sky stuff here). To achieve this we would need a massive ramp up of leadership (FDResk fireside speeches). Reshape mainstream economics so human capital is not viewed and being uncoupled from the natural world and with equity at its core. Ultimately rethinking what constitutes growth, progress and development. Really either option is not pleasant. In a society that failed to wear masks during a pandemic I’m far from optimistic at our chances. The time for technological solutions has passed. The northern hemisphere is already at 1.4c. This is having massive cascading impacts already (go read some food security papers in India/China for this year). We apparently have 9 years left in the global carbon budget (seems like a massive over estimate now). How is the global south meant to develop to a point where they can share the quality of life we enjoy in Australia with that little of the budget left? The restructuring of our energy mix, let alone overhauling the National car fleet will throw us well over the carbon budget (this is just for one small nation). To put this change in perspective, Emissions from today will be causing climate damages and warming for the next 300 years at least. Yes, driving your car today will be warming the planet for at least 300 years into the future. No amount of carbon credits is going to make up for that. The only option left is the social change. Yet, I worry people will never accept option two and the sacrifices this option entails. Would you be ok if Australia ceased exporting fossil fuels and took a massive hit to our GDP? Because that’s the level of change required now. Again we couldn’t all pull our heads together and wear masks.

We have a installed capacity of 32.9 gigawatts and a annual energy usage of 237.39 billion kilowatt-hours (i.e. 237.39 gigawatt-hours. The solar panels would need to generate 650.3 million kWh per day which would require a bare minimum of 54.2 gigawatts of installed capacity and that is assuming that the panels are producing that 54.2 gigawatts of power all 12 hours of the average day length over the year which won't happen. I would do the maths to figure out how much capacity we would realistically need (likely double or more) but I cannot find a good average value on how much power a given capacity will provide as it varies based on latitude and per installation (e.g. the orientation of the panels).,4.5012

Australia,RET,"It's all about storage.

Government should have mandated and facilitated the installation of storage and solar panels on domestic and commercial properties, to maximise solar energy usage, not solar panels only. In fact it would have been better for government as a utility to install solar panels and storage on domestic roofs at public cost and then charge the resident a power bill for it without profit and over a long amortising time period to keep the cost of electricity down, instead of expecting the consumer to pay for the generator and storage out of their own after tax pockets. Essentials should be provided by government as non-profit public enterprise, not subsidising private profit with public money. There is also huge scope for heating water to be used as thermal storage for space heating, via heat pumps, as an extension of hot water heating and storage instead of simply airconditioners that have to be run on demand and not necessarily at the most efficient time of day.",4.8742

Australia,RET,"IMO 100% very unlikely with current technology. The first stage of transition is relatively cheap. Solar & wind. The later stages with addition of adequate energy storage, maybe geothermal or wave/tidal generation will get progressively more expensive. I don’t know at what point (say 90%?), but the costs would get very, very high. Having electric supply that is guaranteed under all conditions would mean over engineering at great expense. A week of poor weather for wind & solar, multi year drought that reduces hydro storage etc. I don’t see how it would be possible to go 100% renewables without having extremely expensive battery storage on standby for these infrequent but highly likely to occur events. Think about it on a micro scale. House with solar & battery. Ok for 90% of the time. Cost say $20k without subsidies. Remove the grid and you have to add x number (say 2 additional) of batteries. One of which you only use once a week. The other once a year. Cost of system is now double the original to be self sufficient for that last 10%.",4.8122

Australia,RET,"Yes. I work in finance and have been in energy and renewables for 20 odd years. 100% renewables grids will provide enough generation to well over compensate for capacity factor, have chemical and hydro based energy storage and in the Australian context will use hydrogen forming capacity. There are enough potential and viable pumped hydro sites along the NEM/East coast alone to provide capacity for ~5+ times our national energy demand. We will be a net energy exporter.",4.3816
Australia,RET,"Sorry, but this is complete fantasy. I’ve also worked in this industry for 20+ years and not in finance, as a sparky and now an energy technical support sme. We delivery grid scale integrated energy solutions including BESS. Do the numbers for renewables work? Yes. In so far as we can theoretically produce the current power we are using. However, to do it we need to take what is a centralised one way grid design and turn it into a decentralised network with shit everywhere. We’ve started doing this and it is a total clusterfuck already. There’s a reason the power engineers of the last century went with centralised power supply and didn’t instead build suburban generators, which would have made transmission far easier. The reason is simple. You need 100,000 electricians and mechanics instead of 50 who work at the large plant. On top of that, you need the best ones because power generation is just a tad more complicated than a Hyundai Tucson or installing a double GPO. Guess what we have fuck all of in Australia? Electricians and mechanics. We don’t need finance, or IT, or HR, or even engineers. We need technicians with practical skills to maintain this shit show of a grid. Next we need storage, and so much of it you can’t even fathom. Because solar and wind are unreliable. They do not produce power when we want it, they produce it when the weather suits. We can not accept unreliable power. Even hydro, the most reliable of green energy, relies on the weather and in a world where we can no longer rely on what the weather will do, is going 100% renewable smart? We have two viable storage options, BESS and water. For water, see the previous point. It has to be fresh and we need a shit load of it. If we had a shit load of viable pumped water sites in Australia we’d have the hydro plants already. This point is just complete horseshit. BESS isn’t the solution, I work on these things everyday. They need to be air conditioned, they’re incredibly dangerous and so they shut down to protect themselves regularly. Then you need to send a tech. Go back to the previous point about decentralised power and the maintenance needed. We are sending sparkies all over the country already to keep these things going. I can promise you we’ve produced more CO2 maintaining BESS than they will ever save us. A 40’ container can store about 8MW/h. It’s drained in about 30min. Even if we have 500MW/h stored,the amount you’d need to run a medium town like Cairns for the night, what do we do when its overcast the next day and we can’t charge our batteries? This isn’t a numbers decision, it’s a practical decision and the CSIRO never came to us to ask our opinion or costs I can tell you. No one in the industry is seriously considering 100% renewables because it would produce an unreliable shit storm where every house ends up running a little generator to cover the hours/days/weeks where the mains power is down. If you go 100% renewables you will get renewables and gas/coal. If we don’t start building some nuclear plants now, you can forget 2050 targets. While Dutton is a flog he’s bang on with this one. You simply can not tolerate an unreliable grid and to get reliability you need base load steam plants. So just choose your heat source, oil, coal, gas, or nuclear? If you care about the environment there’s only one choice.",2.32

Australia,RET,"Look Up, this bright fusion reactor will outlast humanity !",3.8808
Australia,RET,"Yep - and everything else is just a second hand effect of it. Wind is from heating of the sun. Tides are an effect of a spinning earth around a spinning sun, so it's angular momentum imparted from that orbit. Gas and fossil fuels are the sum totally of millions of years of sun's energy and geologic forces smooshing together plants and animals and baking them into an enegry rock/paste. We're going to have to get to a point where we can use that energy without a millennia long production process.",4.7316
Australia,RET,"Yes, easily. Talk to any of the countries going 100% and everyone one of them will say Australia has it the best and easiest to go 100% renewable. Battery tech will take 20 years to truly phase everything else out. Maybe less if we are lucky. But it'll come in the form of iron-sodium based batteries (probably, maybe something different) which are so insanely cheap and also not nearly as hard on the environment as lithium based products. Which is why, we need to spend 20 years phasing into mass solar, wind and hydro projects to be over-sized, and set up in a way to guarantee full batteries on the worst days to cover all down time. How do we know it's possible? I guarantee it is. But how can I say that? I have installed 2 batteries and 15kw of solar on my house. Year round I use more power than before installing the system. I averaged around $500 per bill for the household before. However now I am in growing credit to the utility despite paying connection fees. The system has cost under $30k, that means pay-back period is under 10 years.... However the life expectancy is more like 20. So if renewable is twice as cost effective for me to buy than use the utilities, then it's only MORE cost effective for them to do it. On top of that, this tech only gets cheaper. These $10k batteries were $20k a year ago. Imagine when they are $1k.",4.8624
Australia,RET,I understand how its cost effective at an individual level but could we rely on batteries at grid scale. If an individual household costs $30k and yes of course its getting cheaper I can only imagine how expensive it would be to cover roofs in an entire state. As well as the transmission infra to go with it. My only knowledge of batteries is based on Tesla’s battery in South Australia which had little output compared to costs. But that was in 2017/18 I believe and know the situation could have changed dramatically since then.,3.5464

Australia,RET,What happens when we’re in a drought and the water is at low levels?,2.4536
Australia,RET,"Yes, the countries that are able to get close to or be 100% renewable easily have advantages, an abundance of geothermal (Iceland) or Hydroelectric (Norway). South Australia for instance will soon be able to claim to be 'net 100% renewable' which will involve selling power to other sates when there is an excess but importing power from western states when needed. The claim is basically 'we produce more than 100% of our power usage even though some of our used power comes from non renewable sources'. I think thats a bit of a cop out as far as 100% goes because it only works when other states play ball as far as filling in power when needed. Tasmania for isntance has a goal of 200% renewables but this still doesn't mean all the power used in Tasmania will be from renewable sources. So X% renewable is a bit of a lie but net zero emissions is a possibility that we should probably be moving towards rather than 100% renewable. Especially since as always the devil is in the details 100% renewable could be twice the price of 95% renewable for instance. Finally whilst I may end up looking like a moron and eating my words but I think the storage technology will come. We can convert excess electrity to hydrogen for instance (and even synthetic hydrocarbons) neither of which is particularly efficient - about 40% round trip for hydrgoen. However considering the size of Australia we have the ability to have a significant amount of 'spare' electricity and the energy loss compared to batteries may not be that terrible. Honestly for the first time in history we are looking at having excess electricity and need to find something to do with it, and all of the things that are energy inefficiant may prove to be viable with absurdly cheap renewable energy. The US navy is working on converting nuclear power to jet fuel (useful for carrier groups), a UK company called ZERO is building a demonstration plant to make fuel using water and atmospheric CO2. So yeah, the future is looking bright for renewables even if the immediate path for Australia is simply 80-90% renewable it lays the groundwork for a possible future of 100% renewable and even exporting power. I'm aware of pilot projects to generate hydrogen with electrolysis, bond it with nitrogen to form ammonia which is more energy dense than hydrogen and already shipped around the world in decent quantities. It can then be stripped of it's hydrogen to be used as energy at the destination.",4.7038
Australia,RET,"South Australia for instance will soon be able to claim to be 'net 100% renewable' Despite the claims renewables are far cheaper, the states with the most renewables (TAS, SA, ACT) have amongst the highest electricity bills. They often blame gas/coal still being in use setting the highest cost provider which dictates electricity prices to the consumer. However, some argue why other states that use gas/coal but have less renewables aren't as affected. I think SA will be the benchmark once they go 100% renewables. If electricity prices don't drop sharply for the consumer then it's going to create a lot of negative press for the benefits of renewables and ammunition for the Coalition. Especially for their push towards nuclear power.",4.2972
Australia,RET,"SA is still heavily reliant on gas; over the last 3 mths it provided 45% of its power. Source. Not to mention the security of importing Victorian coal-fired power when they need it.

It is not possible to run 100% renewables right now due to the intermittent nature of it as well as the difficulty in storing energy.

The sun doesn't shine 100% of the time. The wind doesn't blow all of the time. Wind turbines kill birds. Climate change scares the kiddies If we applied the same criteria of efficiency and practacality to motor vehicles at the beginning we would still be dependent on horses.

Australia,RET,No chance.,3.5
Australia,RET,"Yes but the expense is convex in the emissions reduction, as gas peaking plants are a far cheaper way to cover shortfalls in renewable output than storage given extant technology, though costs are falling rapidly so that might not be the case in the near future. Getting to 90 % renewable would be far cheaper as you now can cut the required storage considerably by using open cycle gas plants very rarely, just to cover the rare events with atypically low wind over weeks. This also could be done with biomass but it's questionable if this is desirable. Possibly cheaper than storage is to just build significant overcapacity, this depends on the relative price of generation vs storage, or to use long distance transmission to smooth over large regions, which depends on the costs of transmission vs generation. Also if electricity to fuel plants are economical, it become optimal to build a large amount of capacity and match demand and supply by running the electricity to fuel plants only in periods of excess supply, i.e. now you would have a huge capacity for load shedding.",2.8456
Australia,RET,"Without base load power you cannot. Base load power is coal, nuclear and hydro. Gas maybe but too expensive.

Australia,RET,"If all manufacturing ceased and we are willing to eat shit and move into pods, then yes. One small example is freshly baked bread. This is baked early in the morning before sunrise. If they baked it in the middle of the day the consumer won't see it until late afternoon, so on present shopping patterns most people would be eating stale bread. Milk is another example. Renewables can do more but to go to 100% on available tech is going to result in an unstable electricity grid in which bigger users will either have to close or invest in back up generation. It will be like Lagos in which many thousands of cheap Chinese generators will fire up during a blackout and cause air pollution never before seen in this country.",1.8012
Australia,RET,"Multiply that 2-3c by the capacity factor difference between renewables (~30%) to normalise against the capacity factor of nuclear (~90%). Then, normalise the cost of the life of the asset with that of nuclear also. For step 1 - 2-3c becomes 6-9c. For step 2 - 6-9c becomes 15-22c All of a sudden things look very different.",3.7224
Australia,RET,it is possible. We need to have overcapacity say solar and wind farms that can supply 200% of demand. this way even with variable wind nature they will satisfy demand. And batteries and pumped hydros to balance. I think in the close perspective we need gas powered stations to fill gaps. They're much cleaner than coal and can be turned on and off quickly. Once battery tech gets better these will be just backups.,4.6542
Australia,RET,"Yes we can, but the decades of indecision leading up to this current government (doing a rapid game of catch up) means it will be very painful and somewhat chaotic. Decentralising the grid will be the hardest part. I support nuclear but not on Dutton’s either/or terms. His is a pitch to allow his fossil fuel mates decades more plunder and burn (not to the benefit of the average Australian). We cannot plug the gap with more fossil fuels because the climate is literally on a knife’s edge. If you want a reasonable voice to listen to on this, l’d recommend tuning into what these guys say: https://emergencyleadersforclimateaction.org.au/who-we-are/ I say this noting that Australians seem to like to listen to the voices of influential people who hail from everyday backgrounds.

Australia,RET,"Tasmania is one of the few regions globally to have achieved 100% renewable energy generation in November 2020, primarily due to the high contribution of hydropower. Not a country but it’s big as one in Europe. Population is tiny though. I support decentralisation of power because you don’t want to beholden to a corporate charging you whatever they want because they have control over something essential for life. The more people go off grid the better in my opinion and less power for the Aussie magnates/oligarchs have over your life hence the resistance by so many for change. It’s about power over your life and cashing in on someone’s lifespan, guaranteed profit. I’m not against the idea of nuclear but Europe has it because they have no land mass. Their regions are tiny and not flat land empty like Australia. But with nuclear you retreat to centralised power and centralised government and giving political power to the few who control its inputs and outputs like the company or country you need to rely on to enrich your uranium and then import it back to Australia, you become beholden to them and ideologically I’m resistant to. You also need to change the nuclear proliferation treaty and the contract the libs signed with America about Aukus where it states that Australia will not have a civil nuclear industry. Not sure how that will work if nuclear ever gets built which I suspect it’s just a delay tactic rather than any real plan the libs would follow through. That’s how I see it anyway, I’m no expert.",4.865
Australia,RET,"If there's one thing I've learned in the past few weeks is that Reddit is completely unable to have balanced fair discussions on this anymore. Facts no longer matter. Ideologies appear to dominate. There appears to be two ideological road blocks that dominate: A climate fever where green is the only acceptable answer, no negatively is tolerated. Facts like going fully green is going to cost huge money, resulting in higher power prices and/or significant tax money aren't tolerated well. Neither is any discussion about the elephant in the room that is the futility of all this given the direction of the wider world where counties like China and India continue to build coal and increase emissions with no end in sight. Finally anyone who isn't fully green is a climate denier, almost as bad as a nazi. Politics, where things are only good if your team proposes them. Nuclear from my memory was quite popular here on Reddit until Dutton proposed actually doing it. To answer your question OP.

Australia,RET,I think in the same way how we grew to be relying upon coal and gas fire power stations we will eventually rely upon renewables will it happen in a short term no if you read some of the replies above the issue is with the engineering not necessarily the technology it's about the potential cost of rolling out things right now if you look at the cost of solar panels they've decreased by what 80 or 90% and it's still going down I think it's a good thing that we're looking revising renewing how we generate electricity we've spent nearly 100 years being a slave to coal gas oil and they have clouded our ability to innovate,3.256

You can't make a solar panel make more energy just because you need it, nor can you make it produce energy if the conditions aren't ideal like at night or low wind. We dont have storage technology to store energy times they can produce to times they can't. At least not at scale yet. The need remains for a stable baseline level of power that can be scaled up on short notice by demand. Renewable simply don't have that ability, right ow if we went 100% Renewable we wouldn't have power at night, non windy days or days of calm seas.

Plus many other things such as circular economy ideas to reduce the driver of emissions. The global population (and the meat farming linked to sustaining that) also likely declines as we all progress economically and self limit the population to a below replacement level further dropping drivers. That’s already happening in the developed world. No one thing, lots of things combined in a complex ecosystem which still emits and absorbs carbon because virtually all life is based on carbon emissions.

Australia,RET,Thank god Reddit isn't the real world lol,4.4702
Australia,RET,"Yes, or very close, by overlapping different power generation methods. Use excess solar power during the day to convert water to hydrogen. Use that hydrogen stored as fuel to burn if you need to ramp up power generaiton off peak for solar and wind. Solar farms that concentrate heat could also do the same thing with salt, super heat it, and store that super heated salt overnight to steam turn some turbines like normal if required. Hydro power where it is possible, as we will always have dams, will be an extra source available at all times unless droughts. But you can do the use excess power to pump water into dam, and use that for power off solar/wind peak. Batteries for extra backups and storage where required. It really depends how much money and effort we put into it. You also got tidel power to harness 24/7, but I'm sure that is specific to the environment in its use. Same with geothermal. And even if converting all this to coal only because climate change magically goes away, or nuclear. Renewables are often able to be manufactured, maintained and installed by a reasonable level of skilled trades. And a tapestry of different sources that can be made here in Aus, localised to a great degree, also puts us better off if wars break out. It's easier to target and seize big powerplants, than spend billions of missiles trying to wipe out solar and wind farms across the country side and on every roof. We can rebuild those quickly using local manufacturing and installation, with resources from here. It makes sense on a national security level too. But also social cohesion, it tends to best not to allow key peices of nation demand into easily monopolised assets that can be privatised. Renewables can be installed currently without government intervention and subsidies by the private sector, which will allow for much more competition to keep prices competitive in future even if we get a 'big solar' complex or something. I can't see how we couldn't get 100%, just a matter of will. But there would be more or less efficient methods to get there, also depending on what you consider ""efficiency"".",4.9734
Australia,RET,Anything is possible if it is a priority. There are $billions invested in the status quo. Inertia is difficult to reverse.

On one side we've had people shouting ""it can't be done"" and on the other ""more renewables"". But in the middle are people that actually know our generation and grid saying ""well it can be done, but more renewables at this point is not the answer"". Had we listened to the people in the middle then we'd actually be further along in this transition. the next big challenge is industry.

Currently the government plan is to get to 100% renewables at some point in the future. But right now build as much renewable capacity cheaply, and support that intermittent supply with gas firming. Gas turbines can operate efficiently at various power levels unlike coal and nuclear, gas also can be stopped started with issues unlike coal and nuclear. This gives you the best of both worlds. You see a lot of Albanese working with the gas lobby, because currently the gas industry in Australia are marking absurd profits and the currently taxation scheme has loopholes that they are exploiting. This is very much a negotiation with the gas lobby, to get the best outcome for Australia. Australia was the number #1 gas exporter last year, so we have plenty of it, it’s just a matter of working a policy that both the gas lobby is happy with and benefits Australia. Dutton knows this so his current nuclear plan is to appease the gas/coal lobby, because everybody knows nuclear will take forever to build.

So any person with logic and rational thought would go holy crap, that was a bad storm, it's impressive we didn't get more damage, and it's impressive we repaired that quickly. Deffinately inconvenient but damn could have been worse. We had a compelte dickhead named Stephen Marshall use it as a huge platform for his election that he was going to fix it so it never happened again because it was all labors fault you see.

So after quite a bit of frustratingly explaining this to a complete dumbass and people literally having to draw maps going, if the line is gone, power doesn't go from A to B, adding more power at A won't fix it... he then went to the next event full of asian real estate investors buying up the state, to then announce the same bullshit plan from before to a roaring thunderous applause from the crowd because black out = bad, labor ""did it"" labor bad.

Australia,RET,"I'm not sure whether this would make sense unless anyone reading this can think in similar terms. On that premise, to give a credible reply, this is a too much of a general question to be well served by just a couple of sentences that could fit on the back of a Mars chocolate bar wrapper. And to be credible, it needs to be qualified, hence the long winded spiel below. The short answer is no. We can't just switch to 100% renewable energy. Not now and not in the future, neither as a single nation, nor as an entire civilization, and here is why. We humans have advanced to become the supreme race on this planet because of our intellectual abilities. We modify the environment and use the resources around us to the extent where we can physically intrude and survive in other environments that are otherwise hostile to us. We wouldn't have ended up as the dominant race if we didn't do that. On Mount Everest, we bring warm clothing and oxygen tanks along. In the Sahara desert, we ride camels, cover our skin and bring enough water along to cool down and hydrate. 100 metres underwater, we bring air and pressurized suits or vehicles along. But, by the virtue of being the dominant race on our planet, we have the tendency to displace other species from their own environments by modifying those environments, to then turn them into use for own habitat, leisure, or to grow our own food. At the same time, we also create and manipulate our own technology, which uses far more energy than any one single type of environment can provide, so right alongside it, we also bring our own energy, usually stored in ways that allow us to manipulate it to power that technology, which then allows us to achieve God-like physics-defying feats. Fly faster than the speed of sound, move about in zero gravity, or zero air pressure or no air at all, or even in places where water or soil pressure would crush us in an instant. Starting with the Industrial Revolution, we discovered the wonders of fossil fuel combustion, while in the nuclear age, we learned how to split atoms to unlock unimaginable amounts of energy. We are warm-blooded creatures, and our combustion-centric technology forces us to tap into sources of energy that, by the sheer amount and concentration of caloric power, are only available in limited and non replenishable quantities. For the amount of energy and other resources mankind currently uses, we would now need to have access to other 18 Earth-like planets besides our own. But we don't, so guess what? We are doomed to perish by the mere virtue of the way we exist and multiply. So, to think that we'd ever become a fully sustainable, living on 100% renewable energy, is simply too foolish, and our very own demise is not a question of if but of when. Does all this sound depressingly fatalistic? You bet it does. But I'm yet to see any credible proof to the contrary. In Australia, we used to have a decent manufacturing sector. We don't anymore. Worse still, time and again, various projects, both at state and national level, have either been started and not finished on time or on budget, or not finished at all, or at least not in the way originally intended. Other countries can get there because their national and social cohesion is far stronger than ours, not to mention that their financial and technological potential is far superior than ours. I could go on mentioning the various failed Australian projects that support my skeptical outlook, but this reply would end up being a book instead. However, it's worth noting that we also lack the kind of national resolve needed to overcome the various petty obstacles, simply because, in our haste to continue enjoying the kind of freedom other nations envy us for, we've also become too individualistic and self-centred to make the kind of personal compromises needed to act in unison for the greater common good. In other words, we're only a nation in name and historical considerations, but otherwise, we will never be able to unanimously elect the kind of government that would channel and coordinate that kind of change.",4.9918

SMA inverters and some Chinese brand panels through a large-ish installer (who are still around). Total cost was $17700 before rebates.

Australia,solarpower,"Less. Its about $1 per watt (and that is $Aud) for a well designed system. Add in the REC's (renewable energy credits) and you are looking at even less - Had a mate get 6.6kw installed for $4500 (~$3000 USD, or less than 50c per watt). Panels are stupidly cheap too - for example - Jinko 440 Watt 108 Cell TIGER NEO Mono-Facial N-Type - $198 Aud each. And that is a single panel retail from tradezone with GST applied (ie. you could walk in off the street and buy it). Ex installer here too. Its a race to the bottom with a lot of the systems that are installed, quite a few stupid rules (the old rooftop isolators for example - caused quite a few fires). As long as you have the right meter installed (smart meter, bi-directional) - most people are pre-approved to connect 5kw per phase (10kw in some areas) and all it takes is an inspection and a quick meter reprogram (or they just inform the distributor) and bam its on - the most I have seen recently is a week from install to connection. Personally, I am running 13kw of panels, and 40kwh of lithium batteries.

Australia,solarpower,"Solar is very widely advertised is Aus and is pretty common. I’d say 70% of people in my street have it.

You can finance the install and most installers offer it. It took 1 day to install and was up and running the same day. In saying that my house already had an upgraded meter box, which would have added more time if I needed to have that upgraded. No local government involvement.

Australia,solarpower,"For residential grid connected solar installs, there is a government rebate on panels. This comes in the form of certificates that will be signed over to the installer and can be traded. I just checked and they are worth roughly $0.4 per watt, so a significant discount. I think that one of the advantages in Australia compared to USA is that we have a stronger Federal Government and less state independence. The solar programs, accreditation etc are run at a national level and that makes the process more uniform and streamlined. Of course individual states, the local electrical providers and the local government can put their requirements and approvals on top of it too, but the national programs are the foundation.",4.8372

Australia,solarpower,"When solar technology got to the stage of marketability, the state governments made a conscious decision to promote it in order to create economies of scale - which succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Here in Western Australia, the government decided that because solar panels are visible, it becomes a perpetuating trend where people can be more sustainable and save themselves money long term. (There were a few options at the time in terms of sustainable projects and residential rooftop solar was picked as the one which would have the most enduring impact). The WA state government provided a pretty sizeable rebate on solar panels, and then also the feed-in tariff was huge. It was a massive cost to the government, but it was done deliberately to create a market for solar and drive down the prices over time. It was incredibly successful, and as the goal was met, the feed-in tariffs were reduced more and more. (WA electricity is state owned and highly subsidised so this didn’t involve commercial interests). I was working in electricity at the time and remember when one Minister was upset that it was so successful ($$$) and the other Minister was jubilant. It was hilarious. Being one of the sunniest places in the world, it totally makes sense. Our home panels paid for themselves in 2 years. It’s all free energy from here.",4.9852
Australia,solarpower,"In Australia, there is no need for a building permit when installing rooftop solar panels. Additionally, govt offers a substantial upfront rebate for solar installations, with the installer taking care of the paperwork. The quoted price for individuals includes this rebate, making it lower. In comparison, the United States faces higher average electricity prices than Australia. Consequently, companies in the U.S. enjoy a significantly higher profit margin compared to their Australian counterparts. This is because the consumer return on investment (ROI) remains favorable, allowing them to justify and afford more expensive installations.",4.941
Australia,solarpower,"The federal government subsidises homeowners for their systems. It’s an unfair system; not everyone is privy to it, only homeowners are and only once.

Australia,solarpower,"Yes people generally use payment plans to pay for their solar as it is still a pretty large investment. There was a decent feed in rate for electricity that kickstarted the solar industry. Solar companies were able to garnish that rate to help with finance. It's pretty low now but solar is cheaper. Electricity is more expensive and WFH was a thing so the convenience of running your air conditioner all day for no cost is amazing. I think people are too focused on the payoff time instead of the benefits. It's mostly phone call/cold call leads and offers on billboards. Cold callers get a list of numbers probably from an expression of interest website, get the clients details, salesman comes to home to pitch them the product. Had a friend do cold calling, $600 per lead that led to a sale, got a company phone to use while he was doin it. Although you're mostly on your own. Installs are usually half day affairs. They slap some aluminum brackets down and mount the panels. An electrician comes round later to set up the box.",4.8986

USA installers have to get permits for each system and the council (or whatever your equivalent is) goes out and inspects it individually before connecting it to grid.

I paid ~$6k (after the $2.5k subsidy) for 6.6kw panels + 5kw inverter. This was mid range (pricing wise). We’ve had solar for years in Australia so it’s not really something to “learn about”?

Iirc it's a 16kva array and I paid $5K outright for it. There were government rebates to lower the cost. Just a few weeks ago I tried to find out how much a battery would cost. I found a website, made an appointment with a salesman. Eventually I managed to pin him down to:- a battery would cost about $11K to buy outright, at present there are government rebates to reduce that to about $6K. HOWEVER. This particular salesman insisted that before I could get the battery I would have to sign up for another 12 panels on the house roof, because he insisted the battery would have to be installed right beside the meter box, which is on the house (so far nobody agrees with him, btw). He finally caved and admitted the whole 12 panel array would be $22K outright including rebates. I have yet to shop around some more and see what other companies are offering. There are loans available, even interest free. All that I've seen use one's electricity retailer as a loan manager. One can pay them off with excess electricity fed back into the grid. Both federal and state governments have rebates on solar and battery installations.  Edit to say my solar took about a week to order and installation took 3 hours.

Australia,solarpower,"Ultimately, unless you’re changing energy companies regularly, you’ll end up getting paid 5c per kWh, which doesn’t amount to much off your bill. Try and use as much as you can during the day like running the dishwasher and hot water system on a timer. Even if you’re getting more than 5c per kWh, the return on investment takes a long time.

Australia,solarpower,It is IF you are not planning on moving house in the next 3-5 years. I’m not sure if it’s worth getting a battery still or not but last time I looked into that a few years ago it was not worth it since the return on investment for a battery system was 10 years which is the lifespan of the battery itself. Things may have improved since then but today it’s definitely worth getting solar panels and an inverter installed. Cram as many panels onto your relevant roof space as u can. Once installed you’ll need to change your habits a bit to run everything during the daytime and as little as possible by night to optimise your investment. Since we now get so little back for selling to the grid (circa 5c/kwh) I’d advocate improving your quality of life by running heating/cooling as much as possible by day to capture heat/cold in the house (depending on season) instead of giving the power at a steal to the retailer to sell to someone else at 5-7 times the price they paid you for it.,4.835

Australia,solarpower,"I don't have an energy meter that can tell me what the household used vs exported easily. But even with the now massively reduced feed in tariffs, it still makes financial sense especially if you're home all day and running the AC. We generated 11.5MW of power in the last 12 months, that's only now good for about $650 at a 6c feed in rate, nothing to shake a stick at, but if you never used any of the power generated you're looking at 10-12 years to repay. So you really don't make the gains by selling it back anymore, you need to move your consumption to solar. If your WFH and run the AC you'll see a pretty decent cut. Make sure you do things like washing machine and dishwasher during the day as well and ideally if you can also move cooking you'll see even bigger gains. We're a house of 4, with ""high"" energy usage, WFH, ducted AC and an EV. The EV uses about 250kwh a month - or about $15 to charge from solar for a month! There are some other considerations too, like our hot water runs on another circuit at night so can't currently take advantage of solar, so a few more things to be done to improve our usage. Cooking and AC at night are still our main usages.",4.9662
Australia,solarpower,"Ours started in 2015 and simple cash back six and a bit years later. It cost $6700 for 4.2 kW and we saved around $1100 per year. I kept a detailed spreadsheet and learned a few lessons. You have to use $ per per-kW usage rate, not your average (e.g. $ paid divided by kWh used) because the daily service charge doesn't change. You use less electricity, so the price per kW for purchased electricity goes up a little, again, because of the service charge. Expected behaviour change because of being more aware of your consumption? Lucky dip. Some people use more total power because they reckon cheaper now, I'll take the comfort. As far as the economics, I used solarquotes.com.au and nothing on that website turned out to be incorrect, including the various calculators there. His output calculator matched at around 96% of what we're actually getting across multiple years. That impressed me. There's lots there and he's started to cover electric cars as well. With hindsight, you could say our system should have been bigger, but it was based on likely usage. It was based on our usage figures which was best practice at the time. Nowadays, provided you get approval for your area, maximise use of roof space, and I wouldn't put up less than 6.6 kW for a 4-bedroom house. Otherwise our system has been worry-free zero-maintenance, up until a couple months ago. Our system has been topping out at 2.5 kW lately. In past years I would see 3.3, 3.4 on good days, occasionally even 3.5. Called the company and they said $330 for a tech visit and assessment. We'll see how it goes. Panels are clean so it's not that. Hoping for a nest under one of them causing a hot spot or something else easy to fix. One bad panel could be doing it, and that could be disconnected. Hail damage? We've had the worst of hail (6cm) totaling cars on our road and didn't cause any issue for the panels, years ago. Inverter should last 12 years, and it's only 8, but ya never know, maybe it's a dud.

Australia,solarpower,Your power bills were similar to mine. How much you will save is going to depend on your usage. If you are like us and run ducted ac after the sun goes down then you are still going to get bills. We have a 6.6kw system added. When ac is off we can pretty much power everything using solar. With ac on however that’s another story. And again depends on the weather. 40 degree day the ducted ac will pull 8kw easily. Temp under 30 or late at night the ac will only be pulling 1.5kw. Happy to share some graphs if you are interested. For us it’s looking like a 50% saving but when you consider how much it cost it’s a no brainer,4.9404

Australia,solarpower,"We installed 13kW (10kW inverter). Family of five, multiple PC's and pretty frequent ducted aircon usage. System cost about 10-11k. Bills used to be on average 600-700/quarter (and that's before all the recent price increases as that was a couple of years back), we've had the system about two years now and I only ever had one bill of like $80, every other one has been in credit. I seem to get the odd $120 cheque from the electricity provider too (yep an old school cheque). The only main change we have made is we run the dishwasher and washing machine in the daytimes. The hot water (electric) was put on the usual daytime timer to make use of the solar. Make sure you get consumption monitoring, so you can see how much you are using, as well as generating from the solar. By default most cheap systems just tell you your generation, but its nice to know your usage.",4.7958
Australia,solarpower,We have solar and a battery. We are a 2-4 person household (we have housemates that stay for shortish periods then move out). Our bills are generally around $250 a quarter. The system cost us about $10k altogether when we built the house so we incorporated the cost with our mortgage. I don’t know if we would survive without it tbh.,3.0
Australia,solarpower,"Also look at solar panels as increasing the value of your home. It's an investment that A - saves you money, B - increases the value of an asset So yes 5 k that takes 5 years to break even but also gained value on potential LVR, future sale, ect how ever you structure your assets",4.9314
Australia,solarpower,"Heating on winter mornings will be the hard part for us. Recently installed system is covering our modest summer electricity usage easily, and banking some FIT credits. Would easily cover daytime air-con (but we haven't needed it). In winter, we usually run aircon from 6am until about 9am (when it warms up). Most of that will still need to come from the grid. House has crappy/no insulation, so even if it's a warm day, and a fire keeps us toasty in the evening, by morning the place is freezing.",4.2462
Australia,solarpower,"Also in CBR, got a 6.4kwh system installed for 10k, 7k to me after govt certificates. Usually 3-400 pq, got a $250 credit for the last q because of a temporary 18c FIT. I've gone from buying ~10kwh per day to 2.5 as I run dishwasher, washing machine etc during the day. Ignoring FITs etc the install costs me a touch under 180pq over 10 years.

Australia,solarpower,"I had a 10kw system installed in 2020, cost was about $5k.Average bills at that time were about $700/qtr.First year i had a great feed in tariff of 21c/kw and we had mostly sun for the year, all bills for the next year were in credit. With feed in tariff credits, the ROI was 2 years, so any savings i am making now are genuine savings. If your sales person is calculating your ROI based on a high feed in tariff, do your own numbers with the FIT you can find on your preferred suppliers website, because it could be a lot less. Best i can find now is 12c/kw. If you WFH, it's great. Do your washing, dryer, dishwasher, air con etc during the daylight hours when it's only using your solar. Set your air con/heat to automatically start 1.5 hours before you lose sun on the panels to pre cool/warm the house. Using the solar during the day is better than getting the low feed in tariff. I opted for a cheaper system based purely on my maths.
Quotes were up to 17k for a 10kw with all the bells and whistles and Samsung panels and microinverters etc.
I figured technology is improving all the time, panel efficiency is improving, i don't wan't my ROI to be 10 years and not be able to upgrade because i am still paying for it.
Might not be the right way for everyone, but it was the smart move for me.",4.9722

Australia,solarpower,6.2kw (5kw) in Perth. Electric hear pump HWS and ducted AC in large 4x2. My bills have halved and I am definitely not acrimping with the AC use during summer. In hindsight I would sacrifice the aesthetics and have half installed on a West facing section of roof (currently all north) to utilise the late summer sun. My output drops right off by about 430pm yet the house across the road is still almost full output at 7pm.,1.9154
Australia,solarpower,"We just installed a 6kw panels, 5kw inverter system. Bills were usually $300 a month (pool and aircon and WFH). Latest bill was $178 but it’s missing 10 days of solar input as the solar was install during the billing period. I estimate we might save another $60 off the bill. Hot water is currently night rate but I am going to get a timer installed so it heats during the day instead. I’m hoping we can get down to around $80 bill, saving $220 per month. Winter will be less but less aircon and pool pumping too. System should pay itself off in 3-4 years. I’m in QLD, the sunshine state.",4.777
Australia,solarpower,"Summer bill down from 1300 to $148. Six adult family, including shift workers and gamers, aircon running at night as well as during the day, depending on the day. House has 3 phase power so we went 11kw of panels and 7kw inverter.",3.5464
Australia,solarpower,"Is there a way we can find out if our bill/solar is optimised? I'm very green to this, and we don't seem to be saving all that much on our Origin bill.

Australia,solarpower,"If the feed in tarrif rate is even factoring into your decision then you're doing solar wrong. The idea isn't to sell your solar power to your provider, it's to use your power rather than theirs. Since we got solar panels we shifted almost all our power use to daylight hours. The dishwasher goes on a timer and starts itself at 10am. We put a load of washing on at lunch time and let it run through the early afternoon. If it's a load of towels or clothes we need for the next day, we still have time to run the drier before sunset, otherwise we just let them air dry. Air con runs during daylight hours and then we close the house up to keep the cool in overnight. We've had our panels for about 2 and a half years and they've already paid for themselves by reducing our power bills to practically nothing.",2.5954
Australia,solarpower,"Yes. Installed 2015, panels have a 25 year warranty, inverter 20 year ( I think), paid for themselves in just under 5 years. In a day like today we’ll produce 4-5 times more power than we’ll consume and our power usage cost for the day will be marginally more than the connection cost. But our place is fairly efficient. No pool, one fridge and cooling is only needed when we have multiple days around 40 or heated we the highs of the day don’t make 15.",4.1718
Australia,solarpower,"Sounds great. Yeah, our household is very similar. Keep the house dark on hot days, dry clothes on a clothes airer, warm clothes in winter. Trying to grow tall bushes to protect the house from heat during summer.",4.7378
Australia,solarpower,"100% yes - anecdotal obviously, but I found my electricity power bills creeping up over $900 a quarter prior to solar install. Now power bills range from $200-$350 depending on time of year, even after recent price increases and lower feed in rebates, so at minimum, you're talking about $2,500 per year saving. Our system was around $7k install (after Gov rebate) - so effectively paid off in < 3 years. I'd like to get a battery, and granted it has other benefits, but if a ""good"" battery costs $12k, it would now take 10-15 years to pay off by the same logic, so just not the same appeal or saving potential. Edit: System installed by Gener8 Energy in 2018.",4.9566

Australia,solarpower,"Depends on your area, how much trees shade your panels etc. Your bills will be negative in the summer but you'll still pay in winter.

Australia,solarpower,"a no brainer, batteries are not there yet but solar will pay itself off, specially if prices of electricity keeps going up.",3.6364
Australia,solarpower,It honestly depends on your home. How much sun do you get? How much power do you use? When do you use that power? Do you have money for it or will you be taking out a loan? What Tarrifs can you get? What cashback offers etc can you get from an installer? Can you ensure they'll still be around to honour warranties? All questions you need answers to.,4.5434
Australia,solarpower,One thing to consider is if you are on gas. Because you aren't going to see a huge difference if your hot water and stove are gas.,3.6364
Australia,solarpower,The feed in tariffs are only going to go down and the price for electricity is only going to go up each year. It’s definitely not the life changer it once was but it does makes a dent in your bill. Most solar companies should ask for your last bill or two and calculate how long it will take you to “pay the system off” so to speak. This is a pretty rough estimate but is usually not far off. There are other ways to save money on bills e.g more efficient lighting and appliances etc. if you aren’t sure that solar is the right fit.,4.7958
Australia,solarpower,"Upgraded our system about 18 months ago after replacing our roof. Went for a larger system with battery, as we have a smart meter with time of use pricing, so would’ve had to export a whole lot more during the day to match what we’d be buying in at night. Have only had one bill since not in credit, and that was only because our credit had gotten too high and they’d refunded it to us without warning, during a period with higher use (winter when running ducted at night). On the plus side, when we lost power recently for almost 24hrs, battery ensured we had lights plus a couple of power circuits overnight, and solar kept us going during the day, so lost no food, still had internet etc while everyone else in our area without battery had nothing the whole time. That alone made it worthwhile.",4.4362

Australia,solarpower,"I got it installed in November 2019. For the first two years my credits would cover my winter bills. Essentially it was two years with no out of pocket. Once they dropped the FIT to 8c I started getting bills in winter. Ranging from $90-160 a month. Over summer my bills are $10-$30 per month. This is a two person household with everything on electric. My system cost me 5. 5k, 5kw inverter. With all that said, I am mindful of my usage, but not a Scrooge.

I've moved as much of my power use to the daytime (dishwasher, laundry, cooking on the weekend) and so far 50% of my consumption comes from my panels, I hopefully might see that increase a little more when I start running the aircon during the hot days. My expected payback even with the low tariff rates is <10 years",2.6442
Australia,solarpower,"all those saying yeah definitely worth it lol.... dont listen to all the ""good"" stories, you have to work out YOUR consumption requirements, yours will be different to every one else. first step is forget the $$$ value of your power bill and start thinking of it in real terms which is kW/hrs. read your power meter morning and night set up a spread sheet or a diary and work out what your day time consumption really is. if it is low ie your not using power between 8-5 because no one is home then the payback will be much longer. look to what things you can move onto day time consumption and spread out over the day - dishwasher, washing machine etc because that will be free. if your close to retirement age then probably bigger would be better to factor in more time at home during the day when retired. if not close to retirement then I'd suggest dont go any bigger than you really need or you may never break even on capital outlay",1.7032

Australia,solarpower,Im in crédit every month but got the first lot installed 2012 then others later. Export 12 kw at peak in the middle of summer. It comes down to savings v cost. If you spend 10k and you have a home loan @ 7.95% you need to save about $800 to break even. If you don’t have a home loan and have cash in the bank that 800 does not come into it. The only question then is which is going up quicker? Interest rates or power prices? The other thing is time if use. If you can use power during the day it’s a better saving but if you work all day and only home after hours you will not benefit much from exported electricity,4.9286

I had to rework some of the timings that I used to do things a little, to make use of the best times for power generation, but the installer estimated a 5th at time horizon to pay it back, on current figures I think it will be less. Caveats - I largely work from home so can maximise use during the day, but if you use smart appliances and smart adaptors on powerpoints, you can still get some benefit through timers and remote start features.

Australia,solarpower,"We got solar panels on our first house when the feed in tariff was 48c from the Govt, and 10c from Retailer. We had 4.5kw of panels and 3 quarters out of 4 we'd have a credit at least large enough to cover the winter bill, and often made money. 3 major things have changed since. Solar panel cost and tech is bigger and better. More efficient panels, that cost less generate more and last longer. That's a good thing. However. No feed in tariff. Actual cost of power is close to 80% higher than what it was when we first got panels. We installed 11kws of panels and a Tesla Powerwall on the new home. We make $0 feed in but it has stopped power bills for 3 quarters of the year, and substantially offset the winter bill. For context, our summer quarter bill was $1900. 11kw system with powerwall was $0 up front, and $500 per month for 5 years. So we were actually paying about the same amount for power, except in year 6 we save about $5000 in power (more if the cost per kW increases. Is it worth it? Hell yes. Is it cheap and easy. F no.",4.8084
Australia,solarpower,"Over average power bill is ~$230 a month.

I actually did the math and for $20K I can get a 26kw battery system installed that will pay for itself after 4-5 years and then I will save money.",4.6148
Australia,solarpower,"Yes. If you have north facing panels they’re great for day time power consumption (11am-4pm on average. If you can have them west facing they’re great for the 1-5pm (still some power earlier than this) time all year, and all the way up to 8pm during summer. A combo of both is perfection. They do fuck all on cloudy days- especially in winter, but for 9 months of the year, they are an excellent investment. In both my examples, learn to program your aircon and washing machines to make use of the sun.",4.4006
Australia,solarpower,"Yes, reduces the bill by approx $100-200 a month if it's generating. I have a very shady area with huge trees everywhere. Winter it's basically useless though. But if the sun is out at all, it performs pretty well. Even partly cloudy, it's fairly good.",4.5434
Australia,solarpower,No doubt. We've got 3-phase and 13kw of solar and we get a hefty credit every quarter. Best decision we made.,4.2972

This is something we can’t control. They say it runs the meter and inverter. Next project is new oven and induction cooktop or heat pump hot water. We have solar gas boosted and it seems it just uses gas during summer and never gets hot enough on cold days.

Australia,solarpower,"Ausgrid, which has about 280,000 customers in New South Wales with rooftop solar panels, has introduced a two-way tariff system to incentivise solar panel owners to export their power into the grid in the evening, when it is most needed. That 'evening peak' is between 1600 and 2100. What the fuck are solar systems exporting during that period? You'd need a battery system in order to do that, and if you're doing that, the proposed export rates are so low that there's almost no incentive to do so. You'd be better off exporting nothing and keeping it all for yourself. That's ignoring the cost of the battery which are still expensive. I agree that the overinflated export prices that some people enjoyed were a joke, but there shouldn't be anything charged to people exporting to the grid when a lot of those plans have higher base supply charges anyway. I've had home solar to offset my energy usage (mostly air conditioning, night shift worker), with exporting being a nice little bonus but not the primary reason. If it's that much of a burden, don't offer an export payment.",4.5866
Australia,solarpower,"I am part of the trial, which ends on the 1st of July. The trial boosted FiT times are 2pm to 8pm, and it gives a bonus 25c per kWh on top of existing FiT. I have a battery and pay wholesale prices, so am often getting around 80c per kWh (ignoring spikes, where I get $3 per kWh and over) from dumping my battery into the grid in the evening. The new version is heavily nerfed and overall not worth opting into.",4.1988
Australia,solarpower,It's more expensive to install a system with a power meter so it can limit exports - my dodgy installer didn't put one in 3 years ago because I didn't realise it wasn't included.,3.0
Australia,solarpower,The problem is supply exceeding demand. So companies encourage you to reduce supply. The best solution is for households to combine battery storage with solar panels. Every change re solar panels seems to be pushing adoption of batteries,3.592
Australia,solarpower,"The best solution is for households to combine battery storage with solar panels. If only that solution was even remotely financially viable. The batteries don't save you enough money in their warranty period to pay for themselves, let alone any profit.",3.6364
Australia,solarpower,"exactly, supply and demand 101. the fact that solar is cheap and plentiful should be hailed as a good thing. but when the layman sees that it being cheap and plentyful means the value of electricity they are trying to sell during the day is 0 or negative then all of a sudden its a bad thing. batteries arent yet financially viable, but having appliances that can turn on during the day is an easy way the layman can save with solar",4.1718
Australia,solarpower,Let them get away with it and the price they charge will go up and up. The 1.2c charge per kWH is just to normalise charging you.,3.0
Australia,solarpower,"I mean, if you told me 5 years ago that my solar investment would be generating 0 dollars or in fact costing me money to feed it back into the grid. I probably wouldn’t have bothered to get the system installed. Most roi calculators are based on the information people currently have on hand. So it’s a bit rich to do a full 180 on it. Completely understand why network operators are doing it, but a long notice period for people to adjust their systems or usage would be a bare minimum that they could do.",4.3194
Australia,solarpower,People did tell you 5 years ago that FIT would trend towards zero as solar expanded. There were already days of negative prices for commercial solar farms years before that.,4.1718
Australia,solarpower,"Our electricity prices have doubled from the same time last year, This is nothing more than more cooperate greed and price gouging. Like it says in the article ""I’m not going to be generating much power after 6 or 7pm in summer, and not much after 5pm in winter"" This is all about making more money for the energy company. This is something the government need to step in and stop. Prices cant just keep going up indefinitely people cant afford to live, and now there finding away to charge customers more who have solar. They not trying to do anything but line there pockets. This is what happens when you privities its all about profit and nothing else.",4.2394
Australia,solarpower,"Unpopular opinion, but you absolutely should be charged for exporting at peak ""solar generation"" times. Home solar systems need to have the correct metering so exports can be restricted. During summer days in Australia the wholesale energy price can reach -$0.20 per kWh. Not a typo - NEGATIVE twenty cents. As in, wholesale providers will be paid to consume energy, and charged for exporting it. Too much energy being pumped into the grid causes problems with electrical infrastructure. ",3.0516

Australia,solarpower,"Exactly - the energy market isn't a profit measure, it's an engineering measure to make sure supply and demand are matched and shit doesn't explode. Excess power is toxic and so damn straight you should be charged to have the grid take it away. Or you can do the thing they want you to do and stop exporting!",2.744
Australia,solarpower,I don't know the exact numbers but if they're paying you like 2c for your power and selling it to other people at 20 or 30c how the F do they have the gall to charge you for doing that?

Australia,solarpower,"SA has had a month of calm, mild, sunny weather. Interestingly, it has also been a very expensive month for electricity wholesale costs. Solar is not providing enough power to make things properly cheap. Solar is about 90% the output of peak summer time, but power consumption/demand is probably only at about 60-70%, due to there being less need to heat/cool homes and businesses. So I don’t completely buy the ‘there’s too much domestic solar in the grid’ line any more. It seems wind is what the grid needs to be sustainable and at times over-supplied.",4.5566
Australia,solarpower,Don't we export like 2/3rds of our total production? This entire industry is a god damn scam.,3.4526
Australia,solarpower,so power companies admit they have surplus supply during the day? why are the rates going up then? or is this just in time to capture the energy rebate?,4.5812
Australia,solarpower,"Calm down everyone, this is for wholesale pricing, some retailers will pass on the costs whilst some will absorb it no different to how everyone retailer has different feed in tariffs. “A spokesperson for Ausgrid said a typical solar customer should see an increased cost of 13 cents a week or $6.60 a year.” Can we actually read the article first ?",4.1148
Australia,solarpower,Why the fuck wont this country invest in storage solutions like molten sands and other technologies like that. we have so much excess no and no one is bothering to try and store it. batteries wont be enough.,1.6184
Australia,solarpower,This is just greed. Let's charge people who invested in solar to bring down their power bills as they aren't paying us enough. Why don't they instead pay us to use electricity when supply is exceeding demand.

Australia,solarpower,"Dad installed a 6kW system at his place with a 9kWh battery... cost was $18k installed. His bills went from $800 a quarter to $26. The more I've learned about solar, the more I've realised it depends greatly on when you're consuming the most juice. If you're at home and can run the dishwasher, washing machine and have a hot shower while the sun's still out. You'll speed up the payback period with a battery if you're consuming a fair chunk of electricity during evening peak hours, but it remains a huge expense on top of just getting a solar array installed.",4.3194
Australia,solarpower,Saving $774 / quarter means $3 096/year paying off an $18000 install will take 6 years. we've assumed summer performance though in winter - I can't produce much solar during june-july-august and end up needing to import a fair bit. That's pretty good. Did you get any subsidies on the battery? Batteries alone usually sell for about $15k for a 10kwh where I am.,4.7614
Australia,solarpower,"Yep, we’re similar, though with a 9kWh system… WFH family, run the house off the solar during the day & charge the battery - which depending on what we need to to at night (e.g. if it’s really hot and we’re running aircon, it’ll drop faster, a couple of lights and tv, much slower) will last us anything from maybe midnight to 5am. Similar reduction in bills. We’ve also got an emergency reserve on our battery that can only be accessed in the event of power failure - just runs one circuit to keep the freezer going, plus a small fridge for essential, temp dependent medical supplies and power point for charging phones/power bank and other medical stuff. We’ve only had ours just over 12 months - put it in more for environmental reasons than financial, and because we get regular blackouts (more suicidal possum related than weather) - but it’s proven pretty worthwhile so far.",2.1192
Australia,solarpower,"I have a battery and my bills were about $300 a quarter in SA for about 750kwh. (we have high rates) I got an EV car, switched to a plan that has much cheaper off peak rates but higher peak rates. My last monthly bill was $40 and I used 550kwh. I charge the battery off solar and the grid during off peak rates to cover the peak rates. This is what most people don't do with a battery so the ROI is much higher",3.0

Australia,solarpower,If you're in Melbourne right now. Worth every cent.,3.4526
Australia,solarpower,"Yep my parents are in North Central Victoria and they got through a 30h blackout period with zero issues due to their battery. They're retired so they don't save a huge amount of money with the battery as most of their use is during the day, but it kept them safe and connected while the whole town was out. It also gave their friends and neighbours a safe place to stay too. ",4.8806
Australia,solarpower,"No. Lets simplify the calculation. Say you installed a 10kwh battery. You pay 30c/kwh. In a perfect world you would store 10kwh each day, then use exactly 10kwh over night. So the maximum you could save is $3/day. However, I believe it's recommended to regularily use a max of 80%, so that turns into $2.4/day. I believe a 10kwh battery can cost around $16k installed. In perfect conditions it will take 18 years to pay back ($16k / $874 saved per year). With the $4k solar incentive that reduces to 13 years. Happy to be proven wrong though. I installed a 22.4 kw solar system for $13.4k that generates alot of power (100kwh/day on average). The payback period on that is looking to be 3 years (because i use alot of power during the day). So if you in my position a huge array makes far more economic sense. I think some of the shorter quoted X year battery payback relies heavily on the solar panels doing their thing, saving $$$ during the day.",4.9332
Australia,solarpower,"It's borderline. Straight payback is approx. 7-10 years, with battery life also around 10 years. However, if you factor in electricity price increases and the possibility of joining community battery projects to sell back to the grid at spot rates (like Tesla's Virtual Power Plant which also extends warranty to 15 years) then you are likely ahead over paying electricity bills, and with shorter payback. If you are in an area with access to a 0% interest green loan, and you can handle a 5-8 year payback, it works now.",4.8846
Australia,solarpower,"Solar on its own will pay for itself several times over, a battery will not.",2.7946
Australia,solarpower,"Yes if you have a foolproof 10 year warranty. Yes if the above and you can make use of TOU plans. Yes if you use lots of electricity. No if you just want to use power when is convenient. No if you buy a very expensive battery (but often the cheapies mean you can’t achieve point 1). For once in my life I had good timing in early 2020 and bought a 10kwh battery for about 5k. Through some changes in my electricity usage in the early evenings, and going on a TOU plan, it has been a financial win. Even more so after moving to Amber and charging the battery when it’s a negative price (ie on sunny, warm, and windy days they pay you to use electricity), and selling solar and stored battery power when the FIT is high. Plus a more common thing is to charge from the grid when the price is low and save it for when the price is high - as well as charging via solar.",4.9118
Australia,solarpower,"For every kWh of battery you install, you save about 17c worth of power when you cycle it. If the battery lasts 3000 cycles, that's $504 in savings. If the battery lasts 5000 cycles then you're saving $840. Most of the battery systems in Australia cost over $1200 per kWh installed, so they will never pay themselves back. There are some battery brands that have a retail price that is within payback. Pylontech US3000c 3.55kW batteries are about $550/kWh in bulk and are rated to 6000 cycles. Each kW installed should generate about $1008 in savings, if they last as long as they say. That also doesn't include installation costs. If you can get the batteries at a wholesale price and can install them for cheap, then it's definitely financially worthwhile.",4.9104
Australia,solarpower,Probably not for most. Solar is massively worthwhile - I have negative bills throughout the year now. In the dead of winter I have a small charge but the big credits from peak months more than cover it.,2.8456
Australia,solarpower,"For many, yes but a change in their plans and power usage is needed To make it worth it, you really have to take advantage of cheap times of power. A time of use plan saves you more than a flat rate E.g here in SA I am on a plan that's 54c peak rate, 33c shoulder and 8c off peak I charge my battery off the grid overnight to get me through the 3 hours it's 54c in the morning, before solar kicks in Then solar charges the battery during the day. If it's cloudy or raining and solar isn't covering our usage plus the battery, I'll charge off the grid during the 33c period (or the free period between 11 and 2pm)to cover the 54c between 3pm and midnight. I have basically zero usage during the peak times and my average kWh rate is 11c",4.7302

Australia,solarpower,"Last time I did a rough calculation, it still isn't worth it.",3.4526
Australia,solarpower,"A solar system with a battery needs to be larger than a solar system without one - as effectively you need to generate extra energy to store, to power the house at night. So, on top of the cost of batteries your solar system needs to be scaled up by at least %50. Too many people (my neighbour included) forget this, and have found the battery of limited utility, particularly in Winter. I have 2 Tesla Powerwall2's and they're AWESOME. We lost power for 14 hours in the Tuesday storms, but we were able to run the smaller aircon as needed, ran lighting, refrigeration, and even watched streaming TV (FTTP - never went out). Our summer electricity bills are negative, or only slightly positive (~$20), and we still shave 1/2 off our Winter bills. But the whole 12kW 2xbattery system cost about $40k, and there's no way the batteries will ever pay for themselves in dollar terms. But last Tuesday they sure did!!",3.3062
Australia,solarpower,I'm about due a review of this. I commute in an EV so it's at work while the solar's doing its work and my wife's WFH for three days a week. Needing the AC through this Brisbane summer's been fairly costly (the Qld Govt rebates have been well timed!) but I'll have to sit down and run some numbers. Power costs are likely to drop over the coming 18 months with wholesale costs considerably reduced and retailers' 12 month contracts unwinding.,4.4538
Australia,solarpower,"Can't you charge at work? If there is no outlet at work, put a proposition into management to install charging station. Then they can bullshit how the company is green and saving the planet blah blah. They can take photos and put it on their website. Win win!! Even just a normal 10 amp outlet charging your car 8 hours a day 5 days a week is good. Slow charge is better.",4.8306
Australia,solarpower,If you're going to stay in your house for 10+ years and if you're a higher than average energy consumer then you can make the numbers work. Look into spot rates from people like Amber. There were stories on the Amber FB user group of people earning $500 in a few hours when the Victorian coal generators were offline earlier in the week. With spot rates and optimisation you can import on negative prices and export into price spikes to get ROI ata faster rate. That's not to say that it's a smart investment though. You're going to sink $15k+ into an asset that will hopefully cut your energy bill to nothing so your break even point is likely close to a decade away. Compared to just putting that 15k into a HISA at 5% you would have 24k in 10 years. IMO it depends quite heavily on how big an energy user you are. Big users have much more to gain.,4.9276
Australia,solarpower,"In my mind the key is power cost from grid during non solar generating times vs feed in. If grid cost is high and feed in is low, then it gets better and better to store in battery. Some places this difference is bigger, and the way things are going the difference is probably going to continue getting bigger. Doing calculations now on 10 year pay back might not show value, but what happens if you assume feed in continues to fall and gets to 1c, and grid increases to like 50c?",4.7182

With a battery I'd still be paying the same bill unless I cut off from the grid which is not a good idea, as nice as that sounds.

Australia,solarpower,"I live on Qld Gold Coast - so similar climate to you on the Sunshine Coast. I suggest before you make any decisions thoroughly analyse your current electricity usage. If you have a smart meter you should be able to see your usage by the hour or half hour on line (depending on your biller). So you can see your own family's specific usage by time of day. My biggest winter users are the ducted aircon - set to heat from 5am to 7am every day. Followed by cooking the main evening meal - 4.30'ish to 6.30'ish (oven being the biggest user) - and the dishwasher 8pm every night (after the peak time period). Sure I could use the dishwasher when the solar power is being generated but TBH I would find that pretty inconvenient. So the 3 biggest winter power consumers in my house are used when there is no solar generation - so solar would not benefit me at all for the Big 3 - unless I had a battery - which there is no way I could afford. The same Big 3 for summer usage - the aircon - cooling at various times depending on the temperature, by far the biggest summer user. And yes - there would be an opportunity to use some solar generated power for the aircon. But most days there is no way we could turn off the aircon when the panels stop generating solar power and expect our home to stay cool for hours after that so we could sleep in a cool house - as I have seen in some comments - our house would heat up again in no time! And yes we have roof insulation - and have draught proofed our home etc. Our main cooking would still be 4.30 to 6.30'ish and dishwasher 8pm - both when no solar power would be generated. Note: I have LPG instant HWS - which will probably be replaced with electric when it dies. My cooktop is one gas ring (used infrequently) and 2 induction . I thoroughly researched solar about 4 months ago. Our roof space is not large - and we do not have the space for a vast array of panels to be installed. We were being quoted on 6.6 'ish systems. All the salesman's cost benefit analysis were based on some type of average usage, not truly specific to when I actually use the most power. When I did my own analysis using my specific usage times my results were very different to what the salesmen were telling me! I decided against solar - could not justify the expense for such a small system (without storage) at my age. The feed in tariff is low and will only go lower. Plus there is a real risk that my single level home will be in the shadow of a high rise within the next 5-10 years. Don't rely on the accuracy of the salesmen's cost benefit analysis - do your own analysis using your own time of day usage - and don't bank on the feed in tariff being there forever.",4.8884

A few years ago, it was smart to outlay the cash for solar because when I did it, I was getting a $600 bill that became a $400 credit. So my out of pocket was $5500. I would have been paying $2400 in power bills in 12 months, but I got $1600 back. So, the investment was basically paid off in 15 months.

So if I had solar, on a day of strong solar generation, I would be saving say $0.12 per kwh, not $0.28 which is the best traditional rate I can get now, after Aug 1. That changes the payback, I imagine. It can peak higher after; today at 17:30 it will go up to $0.20 but $0.50 is not unusual.

Australia,solarpower,A bit weird but yeh. Get a camping system and use low voltage lighting. Forget about high loads like welding and electric power tools. However you could add an inverter to use 240v for power tool chargers.,3.256
Australia,solarpower,Solar is 100% worth it. Get your self a Catch Power Relay with your system. It doubles up as a consumption monitor and will only use the excess solar before you send it back to the grid. Your power bills will disappear if you use it properly. Always use a company with all the CEC approvals etc. The companies you see all over social media are all scammers.,1.514
Australia,solarpower,Edit: The list someone else pointed to was a CEC seller list not a installer. So Positronics are in fact accredited installers. Just a heads up Positronics who did my install and have been in operation longer than most and have one of the best reputations in Brisbane are not CEC accredited. I believe this is because the owner is not happy with how the whole thing is run and many companies who are accredited are shonky anyway. The whole industry needs a clean out and overhaul with inspections after install and fines/shutting down of dodgy installers.,4.8826
Australia,solarpower,"Yes. Especially if you have young kids who are still at home and/or have family and/or significant other staying at home - especially during the way. Plus even if you don’t then the solar feed ins help to either offset your costs and in some cases neutralise or give you a cost deficit (so you will make money). Tip for those who don’t know. Sign up for origin to then to someone like ovo who offer 14c/kWh solar feed ins - the origin then team will bring you back at 20c/kWh for the first 14kwh every day and 5c after that. But origin won’t offer that to new customers. For me this means I feed in average $3.50 per day or $1200 per year. This is on top of my zero usage from 9am to 6pm (roughly…longer during summer). Paying off the solar + my night time electricity usage costs me $800 a quarter. It uses to cost me $1400 a quarter way back before the recent price hike. So solar has saved me $2,400 a year. Worth it.",4.8806

Australia,solarpower,Solar hot water is not as good as straight solar in that space and having your HWS on a timeclock to run during peak sun off said solar. Once that water gets hot on the roof it's wasted space that regular solar could otherwise be using for something else/feed out.,4.1718

Turns out electric water heater, pool pump, ducted air con, dryer chews through juice. Went overboard and installed 23 kw longi panels with 20 kw fronius inverter (~$13k with i-tech electrical). Will pay for itself in 3 years. So work out your payback time and see if it's worth it for you. Edit - Should note that our house has massive pool pump, and a massive electric heater.

Australia,solarpower,We put a pool in and added solar at the same time so the pool has really had no affect on our elec bills. We still use far too much electricity at night time so our last bill was $530 less $80 feed in credits.,3.7636
Australia,solarpower,"Yes. Especially if you can get off gas as well and have a storage electric hot water system you can divert excess generation to. In terms of cost, a rule of thumb is $1k per KW panels installed. The rebate is less a rebate and more the sale of the small scale technology certificates your system will generate. But federal government rebate is the layman’s terms for it. You usually sign the STCs over to the installer for a discount on the system price. I paid $6.5k for a 6.6kw QCell panels and 5KW Fronius Gen 24 inverter just under a year ago from Keen2BGreen and very happy with it. Second time I’ve used them for solar systems. Yes, being able to self consume power is best for your return on investment, but even if you’re not home during the day it is still worthwhile. FiTs aren’t what they were but are still good.",4.9728

Australia,solarpower,"Solar is definitely worth it, especially if you plan on living in your home more than 3 years. I work in the solar industry in SEQ and can tell you that Solarquotes.com.au you will absolutely get quotes from reputable companies.

Look for something that’s got a return on investment between 3-5 years and make sure the self consumption figure outlined on the proposal isn’t jacked up to 80%. Self consumption should be the amount of solar power produced that will actually be used within the home and for most people doesn’t really exceed 40-50% (depending on size of solar and personal circumstances, usually is a fair bit lower). Look at installing a catchpower solar relay or if you want a cheaper alternative you could just install a basic timer if you have a standard hot water cylinder on off peak. There are alternatives to this but that gets further into the weeds. Also wait until you have your solar installed and your meter changed (if this is required - your solar retailer should know this) before you change energy plans as this can cause quite a few complications if done half way through.

Some solar companies will oversell that aspect, so keep that in mind. But it is a great investment, I believe it adds on to your property value.

Australia,solarpower,"We're an energy hungry household. We put a 31 panel system in (basically maxed out what we could fit on the roof). All panels are on Enphase micro-inverters to maximise efficiency (if one panel is compromised by shadow, bird crap, or failure, it won't take the others down with it). Produces 80kWh on a clear day in summer and 45kw a day in winter. We generally burn through about 30-40kWh per day but it fully fits inside the solar production in summer, mostly all in winter, and therefore our quarterly energy grid bill is about $200 instead of $2000. Half of that cost is just the daily supply charge. We try to make the vast majority of our energy just during the day rather than overnight, since the feed-in tariff we get is rubbish and will disappear one day anyway. We paid off our system in less than 2.5 years. Well worth it is an understatement. Our installer was Solaray. Very neat work and all equipment is on the inside garage wall instead of on the outside wall, which looks cleaner.",4.8572

Australia,solarpower,"Okay - there’s so much BS about solar - I’ve been triggered, let me lay some truth down for you. Just cause u have the kilowatt potential, doesn’t mean you will get it. Nearly all of your peak generation happens when you’re not home (at work presumably not WFH). Your energy provider will offer you 1:10 of the value of the power that they bill on to others. Any shade at all on a panel will wipe out the panels in the same circuit. So don’t bother if they aren’t going to get full Sun. You gotta clean them or their generation potential goes down fast. A good bird poo is the same as a shadow. So if you’re not good on the roof yourself, it’ll never make economical sense hiring people. Rebates are all essentially over, credit schemes are gobbled up by crafty sales people who sell you the install. The only way solar makes sense, is if you spring for a battery as well. Otherwise you’re just giving power away for others to profit from and paying through the nose when u need it. Any battery you’re getting subsidised through an energy provider will mean ur signing up to their virtual power plant shit - which only benefits them. Lots of people out there will have an objection to what I’ve written above, think about it for your personal circumstances. A lot of the people who say it’s great installed years ago when it WAS great, they’re basically the boomer property owners of solar installs",4.9718
Australia,solarpower,"Thing about the battery though is one can really only store ~$2.50-3.00 of power per day. If you perfectly emptied that 10kwh worth of power every day, payback time for a battery is > 13 years. So at the moment I don't think they make economic sense. (Correct me if I am wrong) Solar on the other hand... in summer I generate 140kwh on a good day. My bills are basically gone, even with a trash FIT, and i use alot of power. My water heater, pool pump are on timer with solar. They use about 35 kwh/day. If I use aircon I'm up for a further 40 kWh or so. A battery ain't going to help with that.",4.82

Australia,solarpower,"it will come down to how big your system is and what you can generate during the day. I've installed a 5kw inverter and 6.6kw of panels which generate up to 45kwh/day, of which I self consume about 5-7kwh, thus can sell over 35kwh/day (and the break even is selling at least 25kwh/day to the grid at my current FiT). Don't expect it to add value to the resale of the house, but expect it to lower your bills.

Australia,solarpower,"Sales people will overestimate the self consumption, usually they like to use 65% which is extremely optimistic at best.

Get a timer installed and set it to run during the middle of the day and set the thermostat as high as it goes so you're using less volume of hot water. If you find you don't have hot water the next morning you can always set it to run for an hour or so early in the morning too - might be a bit of trial and error.

Australia,solarpower,"I didn't scan the entire thread so apologies if anyone else has made this point: going with a solar panel and battery array is about more than bringing the electricity bill down its about energy independence (not having to %100 rely on grid electricity) and redundancy. This is best experienced during a blackout - during the day? you can just run off of solar to power the house no worries; during the evening/night? you should have easily stored enough in your battery storage to see you through the night, particularly useful if anyone in the house uses something like a cpap machine or oxygen tank and needs to be able to power them all night. It may take a while for the system to pay for itself, but I'd argue that energy independence and redundancy are reasons alone to install a solar panel and battery array. That aside, think about the fact you'd pretty much just be using the system to power your home during the hours people are home in the evening/night with little to no need to use grid energy. I can see that $600 per quarter cost drop dramatically, so long as you're diligent with making sure you're switching to battery storage, plus, you can always feed energy back into the grid during the day - it's not lucrative like it used to be but it should still yield something for your efforts (you'd have to look up the fine details to see how it all works where you live).",4.9076

When the wife and kids aren't home, I am. And when I work, they're home using power in some way. Plus, with the semi regular power outages we get, there's always power during daylight hours, and our fridges etc get whatever is left in the battery backup if the power fails as the sun goes down.

The fact that you have no gas is a potential win: heating and cooling are typically the biggest power draws. This includes hot water systems. Some hot water can be put on a timer; guaranteed savings right there. If your home is insulated and your heater or AC gets used a lot? Put it on a timer and use solar to pre cool/heat before you are home. Don't even need to change your habits to move significant power consumption to solar hours for significant savings. But this is AusFinance, so let's put that in perspective with some napkin math. Let's say you invested $10k for 6 years and got a guaranteed 7% interest, and didn't have to pay tax on the gains. You'd have $15k at the end, gains of $5k. One way of looking at it is a bit over $800 per year. Now it's going to depend on where you are and how difficult your roof is to install on, but I'd be surprised if you can't find a decent system for under $10k that is capable of reducing your bills by at least that amount. It was a no brainer for me.",4.9844
Australia,solarpower,"5kw system. Say it generates 3kwh for 6hrs a day to be conservative for 250 days a year. Thats 4500kwh a year. Feed in tarrif about 7c so if you sell 100% of what you produce (very conservative) youd make $315. That same solar panel will cost circa 5k to install so youre looking about 6.3% return on you money in an absolute worst case. In reality you will probably produce more, and use some of it. So your return will be higher. Not many places you can get a risk free 6.3% return with upside for more. Get the panels.",2.1192
Australia,solarpower,Yep. Electricity bill is halved and the left over has been spent paying off the panels. We've got solar hot water too (roof mount Solahart) but often have the booster on during winter so it acts like an electric one. Had the panels for 5 years and they should be paid off by the end of this year. The extra produced and fed in during the day usually offsets what we use at night and I can run the two 7kw main air conditoners in Eco mode all day and not touch the actual grid at all because the 5kw inverter can provide enough to cover it. It was fun to watch my old spinning meter hold rock still while I used what the inverter could output. 6.6kw of panels on the roof.,4.53
Australia,solarpower,You know what’s going to be more annoying is the difficulty you will have afterwards in really understanding if it is helping. Since the most value is in solar produced and used immediately it never shows up and is hard to quantify. We got solar. Shade from around 330pm which is not ideal. Still I think it paid for itself over about 7 years and now saves maybe 150-200 a quarter.,4.5658
Australia,solarpower,Since the most value is in solar produced and used immediately it never shows up and is hard to quantify. Surely your inverter can track what is produced and used internally...or maybe older ones cannot?,4.2238
Australia,solarpower,I do wonder what will happen in ten years. Will you not get as much of a refund as people still need to pay for power or the grid It's the ev issue and petrol tax.,2.7946
Australia,solarpower,"Within the next decade there will be a tax/fee in place, probably collected via municipal rates or similar. In the same way that water/sewage charges in many states are levied (even if they aren't used). You pay for the option of being able to connect to the water/waste system. The electric network will follow the same sooner than later.",1.6184
Australia,solarpower,"Yes, 100% yes. I haven’t had to pay a bill in a while because we are $30 or more in credit every month. Me and my partner aren’t home during the day and use stuff through the evening to night. Currently leaving the aircon on through the hot days for our dogs and still sending power to the grid. Use the government incentives and if you’re local to the Wollongong region I can recommend a business who checks up and will fix anything asap.",4.0846
Australia,solarpower,$600 a quarter is a 10MWh at a 6c FIT. Probably shave your bill by about $150. Plus a bit more if you can bias to weekend use during the day.,3.7224
Australia,solarpower,"Solar sales people are optimistic to put it mildly. Check your local FIT offers and take a look at your own usage. FITs are usually much lower than what you pay for power so using your solar is the best way to make money off it. I make sure I run my washing machine, dishwasher etc staggered and in the middle of the day. Most appliances have timers if you're not home. Saving 5kwh doing this is worth a dollar I didn't pay for electricity. Exporting the same amount is 30-40c. My 6kwh system cost 7k to install. If I save and export 2$ worth a day I'm breaking even over 10 years. I can do that by using 5kwh a day of solar and exporting ~15kwh on average which is possible in winter and impossible not to in summer. I also claim my ""free"" power as if I'd paid for it on tax for wfh, which I don't know if that's strictly legal but there's an argument I would have paid for that power otherwise. Plus all the little things add up, I only charge my power tools during the day like my mower battery (so mowing my lawn is free), I'll use my reverse cycle AC to heat/cool until I dip below 2kwh generation and turn it off and coast for a few hours before turning it back on if necessary etc etc etc ad nauseam All the above aside the average generation of a 6kwh system is 8700 per year which at an 8c FIT is $700 which is almost $2 a day without doing anything. Bit of a no brainer for me.",4.962
Australia,solarpower,"I will admit. We didn't get much benefit at our last house. Cause we were not home during the day much. But in this house? We do notice difference. Cause we are often home in the daytime. So we run everything we need during the day. Washing machine, air con, dishwasher even....all on during the day. So as soon as we got it? Our power bills here dropped. Also. When Solar started. Your panels fed back into the grid and you were ''paid"" for that feed in. NOW? different. We can use our own power being produced and only the excess we don't use gets fed in. Which is much better I reckon. We use our own power first? Then we only buy power if we need it. So that means at night time mostly. There is enough Solar during our days usually to meet our needs. It IS tough to weigh up because it will take you years to pay it off. As yet? Batteries aren't worth their cost. UNLESS I suppose you use a ton of power at nighttime? Then they might be.",4.3616
Australia,solarpower,"With the very low fees in tariffs now the only way to meaningfully get value is to self consumption eg washer/dryer/aircon/pool pump during daylight hours. We work from home and can use all the above. Also waiting on an EV to further use solar during the day. Our 12kw system is on track to repay us in 3.5 years as a result. If none of the above is you the repayment period could be long. Heating and cooling eats the most power so maybe you can get value from that, eg scheduled on/off",3.1032
Australia,solarpower,Can someone tell me if I'm using 890kwh in a quarter nov-jan Is that alot? My bills only $350 of which only $250 is useage...,3.0
Australia,solarpower,"Yes, they are worth it, although it takes time to recoup the initial investment. Our last monthly power bill was $1.80. Family of four, relatively efficient house. We put a bit of effort into ensuring our big power uses (washer, dryer, dishwasher) are used during the day, but otherwise just go about our normal lives.",3.4526
Australia,solarpower,"I have 8 panels on my tiny townhouse. My bills now are solely the fee for service from my provider give or take due to feed in credits. If i had a battery i could go off grid or go into profit. I dig it personally, and future me will thank myself for making the investment long before power bills become painful.",4.1438
Australia,solarpower,I was very disappointed when my inverter failed not long after the warranty period. The cost of a new inverter would have eaten the next 5 years of the savings.,2.0824
Australia,solarpower,"Recently calculated this for someone at work, he was looking at about a 3 year payback period based on 8-10kW system. This is in Vic where we get a rebate, plus the solar credits. The feed in tariff (selling to grid) is becoming quite shit, so definitely better to do sooner rather than later if you're considering it.",4.5928
Australia,solarpower,"Yes. Felt great yesterday in the heat, ac pumping along all day, dishwasher going and more and still had room to send electricity back to the grid. No guilt energy usage and zero cost during the daylight.
Electricity bills are less than half. Mine will pay off in about 5ish years but have a warranty of 20 years. I say fill your roof up with panels. Solar water is good too.",4.7038
Australia,solarpower,Short answer is yes if you're there for the long term. I bought a 10kw system with 11.5kw of panels on the roof. They told me I'd break even in 3 years. I've had the system for 3 years and the break even in reality is more like 6 years.,3.7224
Australia,solarpower,"Depends on system size but if your billed stayed the same you'd have roi in 3-5 years. But prices go up. If you wantnto be spending 4k a year on power, get panels. Even if roi takes a while, provided you don't finance them the cash flow feels better with sfa bills",3.8808
Australia,solarpower,"we only have a small system 10 panels. but more than halved our summer bill and winter one is probably the same as before (7 years ago) now after inflation. we generate enough power to fully negate the summer bill, just that feed in tariff is stuff all plus charges etc. wintertime don’t generate a lot in Tas we use a lot more power now too though as previously both worked and not at home, whereas now usually always someone home using power esp during covid.",3.9176
Australia,solarpower,Assume you will replace in 10 years.,3.0
Australia,solarpower,So far it has been the best investment I've made . My only advice is to plan where the sun will be on your roof over the different seasons and what obstructions you will have. Then tell your installer where you want it. Otherwise they will plonk them in the easiest spot for them. Also learn about inverter vs micro inverter and what suits your circumstances,4.6148
Australia,solarpower,For most houses in Australia the simple answer is yes. There are free tools you can use online to check your roof orientation etc to get an idea of whether they'll be right for your specific home. Find a well regarded installer who has positive reviews going back a number of years. Ours had a 3 year payback. Bills went from $450 a quarter to about $5 credit.,4.6148
Australia,solarpower,"My electricity bills went from $650 per bill on average to $250-300. I had a chunk of money that I knew I was just going to blow on a new toy, and this was a way to invest in my future cash flow - because I knew I was goin to be broke in a couple of months!",2.157
Australia,solarpower,Yes it is worth it for 1:1 usage. If your never home and don't use it during the day not really worth it If U do go as big as U can afford,3.9508
Australia,solarpower,Have recently brought a place with an existing 3 kw system. Can I just buy new panels and a bigger inverter to expand the system. Or do I need to start from scratch?,3.6364
Australia,solarpower,Depends on where you are and what you pay for power. Mine paid themselves off in two years with Adelaide's power prices.,2.7946
Australia,solarpower,"absolutely it is, if you dont know how it works or want real data to do the mathematics, just request a consumption meter in the package, extra couple hundred but you wont be guessing anymore. You either pay up the dollars now or keep spending 3-4k back to the electricity bills for the next 10 years, up to you",1.6758
Australia,solarpower,Short answer: yes!,3.0
Australia,solarpower,"It depends on whether you are at home in the daytime. You can in Victoria get a free meter that can tell you. In my case, most of my power is consumed after hours, and without a battery, I doubt its worth it.",4.4876000000000005
Australia,solarpower,"We have a solar battery with our solar panels in the burbs. We had a blackout in the whole street tonight. The automatic transfer switch turned the power back on in 20 seconds and kept us lit for the duration, a bit over an hour but we could've gone all night. Several weeks ago we had a blackout lasting 6 hours... Seem to be getting them more frequently now. So yeah, it works for me and has nearly eliminated by utility bills too. But you need to do your own sums for your situation to figure out the payback period. Cheers.",4.341
Australia,solarpower,"Yes, yes, yes and did I mention yes? They are worth it. Through a good company, not shit ones. Love my solar. I use air con during daylight, do washing etc all in the day when it's powered by solar.",4.3194
Australia,solarpower,"My partner used to work in solar sales. The majority of people who said ""it wouldn't benefit us as we are never home during the day"", use 50% of their power in daylight hours. Its things like the fridge and other random things that are left plugged in. Then there's a whole bunch of heavy power things that you'll do only on the weekend because very few people will do things like vacuuming during the night.",4.5812
Australia,solarpower,"My pattern of usage is similar to yours and I'd have solar right now if I wasn't renting. My reasoning: EVs are basically viable now as regular cars and prices will continue to drop. Most of them are ready to power the house or sell back to the grid during peak. V2G, two way inverters etc. We're at 20 percent of houses with solar now. EVs will apparently be 50% of new car sales within 5 to 7 years if demand can be met. If the majority of 500,000 new EV owners every year was to charge their cars, even if existing solar owners are overly represented among those buyers, that's a rush on solar right there. A marginal decision now will become a super good one before too long I reckon.",4.2972
Australia,solarpower,"We installed our system 8 years ago. We used solarquotes.com.au to research how to buy, what to buy, etc. and nothing on that website turned out wrong. We used the site to get three quotes from reputable installers. One bit of advice is to never buy from anyone going door-to-door. Good installers have heaps of work and don't need to do that. Our bill was around $500 average per quarter at the time, and we saved $250 per quarter. I was conservative and careful to only credit the kWh usage rate. Our system is in Sydney and 4.1 kW in size. Today it would be $600-700 and we're saving around $300-350. After proving, I stopped tracking it closely. Panels are well worth it (around 15% to 20% internal rate of return) unless you have serious shading issues. Domestic storage batteries do not yet have a positive return. There are more options today, such as switching water heating to daytime only (provided tank is large enough), so as to consume more of your own power. Domestic water heating is the most cost-effective form of surplus energy storage from solar panels. Some installers will upscale to include battery and show a positive return. It will be less than panels alone, essentially using the great return on panels to make the battery look good. They'll emphasise that being away during the day you must have battery. All flat-out crap to make a bigger sale. Don't fall for it. You'll probably use the timers on your appliances to run dishwasher and laundry when you're out. Your aircon likely also has a timer, so you can turn it on before you get home. Plus hot water as mentioned. Other options open up but may be too much bother. For example you can read your meters each morning and evening which can be helpful with choosing best energy purchase plan. Good luck with it. You'll be very happy with the numbers at the end.",4.985
Australia,solarpower,"Worth it for me but I work at home, and do the washing,drying,dishwasher, type stuff during the day.",3.4526
Australia,solarpower,"It was definitely worth it in my situation. 4 bedroom house with Ducted aircon and family. away at work/school most days. Installed 13kw panels and 10kW inverter 1 year ago. Easy to get good numbers with a Smart meter which was actually required in my case. Hot water on timer so it only turns on between 10-4 when panels are usually generating. So far based on actually usage - average 214 dollars per month reduction in power bills, up to 300 per month in middle of summer. It is good to see a negative power bill over the school holidays when the air con is running all day.
Our FIT actually increased by 40% in regional QLD in the middle of last year which will improve those numbers further.",4.9322
Australia,solarpower,"Honestly, I barely think mine is worth it. FIT in NSW went to shit and I'm in an office 8-5 everyday.",3.843
Australia,solarpower,Something else to consider if you're thinking you might sell before payback time. Local real estate agent adds about $1-2k per KW solar in valuation to places he is selling and that is based on what buyers want or accept. It is a key selling point now.,4.2972
Australia,solarpower,"We are a 3br/2ba house with 2a +2k. I work at a school so home all summer. Back to full time work for both adults now plus kids at school. We pay approx $100 a fortnight for our panels. Our most recent electricity bill came yesterday and it’s $350. So about $950 for the quarter. Prior to getting panels our bills were $1000-$1500 for the summer quarter. So we are just as well off (slightly better) while still paying off panels. Once our panels are paid for (5 years interest free, 3 years to go) then we will be absolutely laughing. But even while paying them off it’s good for us. I do as much as I can during daylight hours, but obviously can’t do some stuff as I’m not home. For example, always run the dishwasher first thing in the morning when I go to work with last nights dishes in it. Also sometimes put washing machine on for delay start, have it ready to put in tumble dryer before I go to work. So that those things are running off solar. Turn air con on before I go to work and have it run all day on hot days, all off solar panels and it doesn’t work as hard doing that as it does if I leave it off all day then turn it on after work when house is hot & stuffy already.",4.869
Australia,solarpower,"Please correct me if I am wrong, but I don’t see the need for solar for myself personally. At this point the elec companies are taking in free power from us if we install solar, they’re paying us 4c per KW, fk all for it considering they charge us 0.30c per KW and we’re paying to install the solar and feed what we don’t use to them, seems like the biggest scam of all time, they knew they’d lose money to solar. Yes you save in the day time, but who’s realistically home during the day? I get home from work at about 6pm and need the air con in the afternoon/ night..",4.2738
Australia,solarpower,"Look, you probably won't get your money back. The other thing they don't tell you is that there's upkeep - cleaning etc - and also the utility decreases over time.

Australia,solarpower,"My panels have a 25 year warranty and the microinverters attached to them have a 20 year warranty - I bought top of the range for the time to maximise my energy generation, because the layout of my house wasn't overly optimal (majority of panels are east and west, with only a handful facing north). So the better panels had a greatly increased efficiency, and also a better life time. As for cleaning, I tend to do mine every three years - there is a local business that will do them, and whilst he's doing the panels he will also give the outside of the house a quick clean. About $150 for three hours work.",4.9154

Australia,SSP,"It's great to see leadership that believes in Australia. I put solar on my home 10 years ago and tried to get an installer who would use Australian made Tindo Solar panels but none would. I wound up with LG panels. Last year I put solar onto a shop I use to run and again, could not get an installer to quote on Tindo Solar. The problem is we have been so brainwashed to believe we cannot make stuff in Australia. I started my working life as a trainee engineer in the automotive manufacturing sector in a company that employed 1300 people supplying axles, engine valves, conrods, etc to Australian manufacturers. That company is long gone and there are zero people doing that in Australia. We can make stuff, we can make good stuff but the big problem is most of our companies are owned by multi-nationals and they don't want a workforce that works efficiently or builds quality, they just offshore and say stuff it. Australia needs to support Australian companies and STOP the sale of Australian companies to foreign owners who shut down manufacturing after a few years or put restrictions in place that make competitive exporting impossible.",3.4526

No. But we're not doing this because of business, we're doing it because we need to get off fossil fuels. The cost economics aren't exactly as important as people seem to think they are. Logistics are the main concern, with a domestic panel manufacturer they can import more raw cells which ship more compactly and at an earlier stage in the value chain. This would mean more panel availability domestically and lower prices overall as well as more of the value captured and taxed within Australia and less money going overseas. So even given cost economics aren't as important as people think this plan would have many cost economical advantages overall to solar build outs.",4.5158000000000005

Australia,SSP,I agree with OP. This feels like a waste of money for no extra benefit compared to just importing the panels from China. In terms of solar IP they most definitely have more and better tech. They have the economy of scale to bring prices massively down. Solar panels are not sensitivity tech in anyway and will always be available. If it is about jobs then just get China to built a manufacturing here why start from scratch and end result is it will be a lost making business.,4.604

Australia,SSP,"If the state and local government want to replace our coal fired power stations with hundreds of thousands of solar panels, then it actually is “cheaper” for the Australian economy to buy domestically made solar panels. When something made in Australia is purchased by the government, the cost gets recouped through taxes. Workers at these solar plants buy groceries and pay tax. Retail consumers buy solar panels and pay tax. Every domestically made part and material has tax involved in its sale. But if we purchase solar panels from overseas than that money is sent directly into the Chinese economy, never to return.",2.1192
Australia,SSP,"China are also subsiding the solar panels below cost price to dominate the market.

Australia,SSP,"“is there a way I can shut off my exports and still use solar” the expensive way is: add a battery to your system and you can fully island when you need to, as well as obviously store power for later use and/or selling into the grid in the evenings for a high price the somewhat less expensive way is: a smart inverter that can tune your exports to be more variable, not just on/off like older inverters do.

Interesting seeing how some other countries are tackling this, forcing high power usage for industry/manufacturing during those times and shifting working days to allow for it.

So 3.3c FiT, ""sun tax"" of 1.2c == 2.1c FiT. Not ""you pay us 1.2c"". They're just trying to make you more motivated to use your own generated power instead of flooding the grid with it for the sake of grid stability. Being able to curtail exports is inverter dependent. Generally it requires a consumption monitor as the inverter needs to react to your usage, i.e. if your house wants 1kw it limits the output from your PV to 1kw instead of say the 8kw it could currently pump out from the sun.",4.6962

Australia,SSP,I had a system installed to prevent excess solar returning to the grid. (It consumes the excess) Was actually a requirement before I could get approval to install.,3.0516
Australia,SSP,Others have answered already but basically it's this: You generate the most power around midday when the demand is at its lowest compared to supply available. Since they don't have a cheap effective way to store that energy they basically charge you money as an incentive for you to not send them energy then.,3.0516
Australia,SSP,"Simple put: Before RET and most renewables power generatated was worth about 4c/kwhr. The governments subsidised solar and have extremely generous perks as high as 44c/kwhr without requiring batteries or any requirement for generation consistency. There is now a surplus of energy in the middle of the day when the sun shines. Not only must all the coal and gas generators spin down, but load must be turned on to burn the power away. The idea of the sun tax is really just to get owners to install gear that will turn off there panels when there is too much excess power.",3.9176
Australia,SSP,This is why 100% renewable won’t scale in Australia. The amount of power during mid day when demand is low is actually detrimental to the grid while the power deficit during peak hours when little power is being generated and demand is through the roof just doesn’t cut it.

The interest-free loans for solar panels are also a good use of taxpayer funds, as they help to promote clean energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

Australia,subsidies,"Publication: Australian Financial Review Author: John Kehoe The transition to cleaner energy is becoming a tax break and subsidy gravy train for higher income earners and the wealthy. Hard-working taxpayers are funding all sorts of federal and state concessions for electric vehicles, solar panels and electrification of homes, while the less fortunate struggle to afford their energy bills. The handouts are an extremely expensive way to reduce carbon emissions, as the Productivity Commission highlights. It marks a failure of the political system to sustainably impose a relatively low-cost, economy-wide and efficient carbon price, tax or levy. Instead, resorting to tax breaks and subsidies is very inequitable. People with above-average incomes and wealth who can afford electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, new heating and cooling systems benefit disproportionately. People who can’t afford these clean-energy technologies will miss out. I recently replaced our family home’s old, ducted, gas-heating system after it blew up. The Australian Capital Territory offered me an extremely generous 10-year, interest free loan of $15,000 to replace the gas heater with an electric system. In today’s dollars the subsidy is worth at least $3300, assuming an average inflation rate of 2.5 per cent. In a high-inflation and rising-interest rate environment, the subsidy is likely worth a lot more than that, compared with a commercial interest rate. Naturally, I took the taxpayer-backed deal to buy a new reverse cycle heater and air conditioner, even though I felt it was dudding other ACT ratepayers. But it seems I’m not the only person financially benefiting from the scheme. The ACT government has hired clean energy financier Brighte to administer the sustainable household scheme. https://imgur.com/a/yvJLvkB Brighte is part-owned by billionaire software entrepreneur and clean energy advocate Mike Cannon-Brookes through his Grok Ventures. The ACT government in partnership with Brighte is offering similar generous deals for rooftop solar panels, household batteries and storage, air conditioners, hot water heat pumps, electric stove tops, electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging and ceiling insulation. It’s not surprising that the forecast loans under the scheme have swelled by 33 per cent to $200 million. The ACT, which easily has the nation’s highest median household income because of ubiquitous, well-paid public servants, has about double the number of electric vehicle sales per capita, the Australian Automobile Association says. Tax breaks for the wealthy Nationally, EVs have become one of the biggest tax breaks for the well-heeled. They benefit from the Commonwealth’s exemption from fringe benefits tax (FBT), cash subsidies from state governments and discounts on stamp duty and registration fees. Exempting low and zero-emission cars from FBT potentially saves buyers as much as $30,000, excluding other state government handouts. It’s a boon for the sales of Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world’s second-richest billionaire on the Forbes rich list. Yet, tax breaks for EVs are an extremely expensive and ineffective way to reduce carbon emissions. The Productivity Commission estimates the cost of carbon dioxide abatement for EVs from the FBT exemption at between $987 and $20,084 a tonne. The cost to taxpayers dwarfs the carbon price paid by heavy emitters of less than $40 a tonne via Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) and the $75 carbon price cap the government has imposed for the carbon safeguard mechanism. The commission notes that supply constraints and delivery delays are already leading to extended wait times for EVs in Australia. “With supply the principal constraint for EV uptake in Australia, policy efforts to increase the demand for EVs, such as tax concessions and rebates for EV purchases, run the risk of simply adding more people to the proverbial queue, subsidising people who are already in the queue, or in the case of tax concessions that are selectively available to some groups, simply pushing those selected groups to the front of the queue – all for no appreciable gain to the overall number of EVs on Australian roads, relative to what would have otherwise been the case,” the commission says. “Using the FBT [fringe benefits tax] system for alternative policy goals like attempting to drive EV uptake risks compromising the degree to which the FBT system protects the integrity of the personal income tax system, potentially reinforcing equity concerns in the process.” Meanwhile, the South Australian Labor government has scrapped a planned road-user charge for EVs, fulfilling a populist election commitment. Again, another tax break for well-heeled EV drivers, while battlers driving petrol-guzzlers pay fuel excise.",4.9928
Australia,subsidies,"Good Victorian policy Tax economists such as Ken Henry (a strong environmentalist) have for more than a decade advocated road-user charges for all vehicles, embedding the cost of road surface damage, noise, congestion and carbon emissions into the price. Much more sensibly in Victoria, electric vehicle drivers already pay 2.6¢ per kilometre and plug-in hybrid car drivers 2.1¢ per kilometre. But with the $12 billion federal fuel excise revenue in decline, the Commonwealth is inexplicably joining a High Court challenge against Victoria’s EV charge. Victoria is enacting good tax policy (a rare compliment from this writer for Dan Andrews’ government). Road user charges are a more economically growth friendly form of taxation than damaging state taxes such as stamp duties on property sales, insurance taxes and narrow payroll taxes. User charges on drivers could also reduce vertical fiscal imbalance between the federal and state governments. States currently account for about 22 per cent of the nation’s tax revenue but are responsible for about 40 per cent of spending and are highly dependent on financial transfers from the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is interfering by backing Victorian EV driver plaintiffs who argue the charge is an excise, which only the Commonwealth can levy. In theory, the Commonwealth wants to retain the right to impose a federal EV road user charge in the future. But Victoria, with other states such as NSW due to follow, is getting on with the job. It is better to implement the charge now because it will be much more politically difficult in future years. As French statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert famously said in the 1600s, “The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”. The danger in deferring to the Commonwealth to implement a national road-user charge scheme, is that it will take too long – if it ever develops the political courage – and there will be too many EV drivers resisting by the time it gets its act together.",3.68
Australia,subsidies,"Subsidies must always be backed by taxation. I see no problem taxing higher income earners more, then giving everyone subsidies on green alternatives, even if higher income earners are more likely to be making those purchases.

EVs have a much longer life than ICE vehicles (which become a maintenance burden).",4.6542

That said, it would require a dramatic change in business model to operate without the ITC. One of the biggest issues is simply that power is very inexpensive in most of the US. The solar return on investment just isn't that good without subsidy. I certainly wouldn't have gone solar without it - the unsubsidized math makes no sense whatsoever at $0.12/kwh.

They have been there for us over the two and a half years its been operating. We didn't rely on the government subsidy to swing the system but it was very nice. Our wants are probably different than most. We wanted to reduce our carbon footprint. As well as cheaper electric bills. But we live under the tva. So our electric is fairly green as is. And cheap. But our cost of living has been reduced by solar and our EV.",4.4006
Australia,subsidies,"Residential solar is probably going to need subsidies for a while because it needs to transform, similar to what we’re seeing in California with NEM 3.0, to a point where new solar installs pay for themselves via avoided costs and self-usage. Subsidies are needed in parts of the US where electricity costs are artificially low because utilities aren’t paying for the carbon dioxide they dump into the atmosphere, and are needed in the high electricity cost places because those locales have too much solar(duck back) during the daytime, so adding more to the grid without using batteries to improve self-usage, just adds to curtailment. The big issue with residential subsides nowadays is that it is delivered as a tax credit. The wealthy are getting good deals because they can pay in cash and use the tax credit themselves. The less wealthy are using the tax credit as part of a financing scheme where they can pay very little upfront, with the financiers getting a nice slice of the pie via the tax credit, then paying out far more than the original cost over time. And with higher interest rates, financing has gotten quite expensive.",4.6628

It is unsustainable, where entire new subdivisions all have solar so none of them will ever have a bill.  Solar companies will adapt and new pricing models will develop.  Right now, anywhere without net metering needs batteries, and the cost reduction in lifepo4 batteries has been tremendous, but they are still prohibitively expensive without subsidy. This is the same as the decline in solar panel prices, and inverter prices.    Massive progress, but still more efficiency is needed.  Prices will continue to decline, so your can' see a path to where subsidies aren't needed, but we aren't there yet.

Australia,subsidies,"The US residential and commercial rooftop solar industry has become dependent on the subsidy.

The ITC brings that down to $2-$3/watt for the homeowner. In Australia, the same damn product costs $1-$2/watt before any subsidies. There is no reason it can't be like that here. And the specialized solar finance companies would have so much less $$ to finance that they would probably move on to something else. Can the industry survive without subsidy? Yes... Will it? Not in the same form as it exists today. Large utility-scale solar is a bit of a different beast. I believe it can stand on it's own today without subsidy. But, we won't really know until we take the subsidies away, which doesn't look likely for the next decade. The best positioned company, in my opinion, to survive without subsidies is Tesla.

We have seen this with EV's. Our feebate scheme (subsidy on new and fresh import used EV's) ended at the end of last year (reflecting a government change), and EV's exemption from road taxes ends in a month (reflecting EV's now making up 2% of the light vehicle fleet).

As for solar …. The subsidies are needed for a few reasons … huge upfront cost —your buying something that warranty 25 yrs vs paying monthly utility … utility costs are low in USA people need financial motivation to change otherwise why not just keep paying utility as demand and volume increases the solar technology gets better more efficient

Australia,subsidies,"It's an interesting question and one that's been debated in the solar industry for a while. The truth is, the solar industry has made tremendous strides in cost reduction and efficiency improvements over the past decade, thanks in part to subsidies that have helped drive demand and scale up production. However, the industry is reaching a point where it's becoming increasingly competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources, even without subsidies. Solar energy prices have plummeted, making it cost-competitive in many regions without the need for significant government support. That being said, the sudden removal of subsidies could certainly impact the industry, especially in the short term. Companies that have relied heavily on subsidies may struggle initially, but the overall trend towards lower costs and increased efficiency suggests that the industry is moving towards sustainability without subsidies. There are also other factors at play, such as the increasing focus on sustainability and renewable energy targets by governments and businesses, which could help drive demand for solar energy even in the absence of subsidies. In conclusion, while the solar industry has benefited from subsidies in the past, it is increasingly able to stand on its own without them.

But if you instead use fuel to run a generator or drive vehicles on private property, well that's not using public roads and infrastructure, not causing any damage to public infrastructure, and therefore the tax component of fuel costs can be reimbursed. Renewable energy firms can also take advantage of that Fuel Tax Credit Scheme, in fact every single business can.",4.9266000000000005

It raises billions for the economy, and it isn't imposed on any other commodity. Fossil fuels contribute more to govt coffers than any other commodity. On top of coal royalties, and GST at the pump, You get the excise tax back if you don't use roads, i.e. diesel for your fishing trawler, or farm harvester, or mining truck. You don't get the GST back, and If you drive on roads then you don't get the excise back either. Where is this lost money going to come from if not an excise tax on renewables? You don't get that tax on renewables. If giving back excise to people who don't use roads is a subsidy, then not charging excise at all, even if you drive your electric car on roads must also be a form of subsidy that's even greater. When we transition totally, there'll be no more $billions in excise, or royalties so there will be a big shortfall that will have to come from somewhere if we want government services maintained.",4.4368

Those subsidies ranged from 30% to 50% of the price of the system. The funds came from royalties during the mining resources boom. You'd usually pay the balance to the installer and they'd bill the program for the rest. Now, you don't get a subsidy, you get Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), that you can sell to big polluters to get some of your money back, but it's not a lot, less than 20%. If the govt would review royalties on our mineral resources - including gas - there'd be plenty of money available to subsidise home batteries.

Australia,subsidies,"There are enormous benefits of siting batteries on the demand side of the grid. Wind and solar generation are rapidly getting cheaper, but they are causing grid costs to rise faster. Overall, electricity is getting a bit more expensive. If we don't change how grids are run, this will continue. The government should setup a battery virtual power plant distributed in the homes of people with solar. Similar to this company: https://www.volts.wtf/p/a-clever-new-way-to-distribute-storage The homeowners pay $2000 to install a 20-30 kWh battery. The virtual powerplant (acting as the electricity retailer) can store, then sell electricity when wholesale prices are high. The homeowner gets lower grid import costs (for the little they still need to import). The virtual power plant makes enough to pay back borrowing costs over 15 years. And everyone else benefits from lower electricity prices - less new generation and powerlines are needed to be built, less grid upgrade costs. We have so much rooftop generation being wasted now. With LFP and sodium ion battery prices about to massively reduce in price for at least a decade, this scheme is a no brainer. It should be government owned to take advantage of their low borrowing costs.",4.127
Australia,subsidies,"It's not wrong though. They charge through the teeth for peak usage, when you cannot avoid power usage (dinner, showers, lights, heat etc). People complain about how much excess solar is pumped into the grid during the day, but that wouldn't happen if it was going to a battery. And in the news they're saying we will have a shortage of electricity, hence the need for gas... In Vic there's an 8k interest free loan to help with the initial purchase of a battery... but your automatically signed up to the VPP, so they can take power from your battery whenever they want. This means that the consumer, whilst still paying for electricity service, and paying off the battery and solar, is paying for the infrastructure with no compensation for their outlay, and rising bill prices despite them taking pressure off the grid, and providing power to the grid when required.",3.097
Australia,subsidies,"The mistake most people make is getting too small a system.

There is a relatively small increase in cost to go to a 10kW+ system which will produce meaningful export, and there are decent FIT deals (8-12c uncapped) out there if you hunt around for them. I literally haven't seen an electricity bill since I put solar on, including running ducted aircon for months, charging a car, etc. In my case, adding nearly 60% to the size of the system cost an extra 35%, and dramatically improved the payback/ROI of the system. I think most people just go for the cheap option without thinking of the benefits.",4.8092

Australia,subsidies,"More and more Australians are struggling to afford their power bills. Origin and AGL have released new data showing the number of customers in their hardship programs has risen by 35,000 – a 40 per cent increase in one year. Around 125,000 households now rely on bill relief from the two companies. Australia’s bulging pipeline of renewable energy developments has been hit by construction and registration delays, with the market operator flagging a substantial increase in the time taken to deliver projects into the nation’s grid. Data from the Australian Energy Market Operator showed that while it approved 12 gigawatts of connection applications in the last financial year, bottlenecks had seen a jump in the timeline for delivering new energy supplies. The “time taken for developers, construction providers and original equipment manufacturers to physically deliver these projects has increased substantially with 75 per cent of projects taking up to 21 months to be constructed and ready for market registration”, AEMO says in its latest engineering roadmap report. “Key challenges include project financing, the volume and complexity of contractual arrangements, workforce resourcing and supply chain constraints.” Australia will need to install 16 times its current capacity in batteries and pumped hydro by 2050, while large-scale wind and solar generation will have to jump sixfold if the country is to achieve a transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In the near term Labor has set an ambitious target of having renewable energy generate 82 per cent of the country’s electricity by 2030. To hit that target, some 6GW of capacity must be added every year. However, AEMO said delays meant only 2.4GW of projects achieved market registration last year while 2.2GW achieved full output in the 2024 financial year. Over the past three years, the number of connection applications received by AEMO has nearly tripled from 6.5GW across 45 sites in 2022 to 19GW across 81 sites in 2024, according to AEMO. The operator said the time taken to reach full output across 75 per cent of projects has been cut from 11.2 months in 2023 to 6.9 months or less in 2024. However, problems in the physical deliver of projects remained a handbrake. “These are challenges that fall outside of AEMO’s direct remit and instead require broad whole-of-sector efforts to address, without which there will be difficulties in realising the 2024 integrated system plan optimal development path,” AEMO noted. The warnings come after industry players said a major wind drought that caused wholesale prices to spike provided a stark warning about what would happen if Australia did not develop a diverse mix of fuel sources, amid broad concern the role of gas was being downplayed. AGL Energy chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said a wind drought in the June quarter illustrated the need for a broad range of generation types. “The low wind levels across the National Electricity Market in recent months demonstrate the importance of a diverse and flexible portfolio of assets that can respond to variable conditions,” said Mr Brokhof. “Through this period AGL was able to rely on the increased availability of our thermal fleet in combination with our hydro assets, gas peaker and battery portfolio to meet our customer load. As the penetration of renewables increases in the coming years, firming and short and long duration storage provided by grid-scale batteries, pumped hydro, and gas peaking plants will become increasingly important.” The comments are a stark warning as the role of wind is expected to grow as Australia struggles to develop sufficient back-up options.",1.7526
Australia,subsidies,"To meet the 2030 target, Australia must install about 40 wind turbines a month, an ambitious feat that could leave the grid more precariously placed. “There is a lot of attention on developing renewable energy but what is going to support the grid when the conditions aren’t suitable? Batteries do the job for a few hours but the wind drought this year illustrates the need for gas,” said one senior industry executive who declined to be named. Australia’s east coast faces tight supplies. The Australian Energy Market Operator in March said a gas shortfall could emerge as soon as next year and although mitigating steps could be taken, a deep structural deficit would emerge in 2028. A bitterly cold winter saw AEMO issue an emergency warning earlier this year, and data released by the market operator showed wholesale electricity prices had spiked as a result. The cost of producing electricity across the national market averaged $133/MWh in the three months to June 30, 23 per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, the operator said. The increase followed a slump in renewable energy generation as wind output fell to a multi-year low, increasing Australia’s reliance on gas. AEMO said during the three months, gas-fired generation rose 16 per cent from the same period one year earlier. The increase in wholesale prices will not be immediately felt by households and businesses, but the rise will be a major component in the next default market offer – the benchmark price for annual bills. The increase in wholesale prices was particularly beneficial to Australia’s largest electricity and gas retailers, Origin Energy and AGL Energy. Both companies announced bumper full-year results this week after coal fleets at near capacity, while also using their gas peakers and batteries.",4.846

Australia,windpower,"I've attended a talk by the liberal party ""think tank"" on nuclear, because I was at a renewable power conference and they somehow got on the program. I will say, their analysis is quite correct from a technical perspective except for politically, but I'll get back to that later. Its basically all them scamming us to convince a bunch of boomers that when there are power problems it was all Labors fault. Effectively, they point out that nuclear can be built cheapely and economically. The US model of building nuclear with a private industry is not viable. Only a government led organisation with special rules around project long term operation is workable. Let's look at that politically. A new government run large infrastructure entity is not acceptable to the Liberal party. Or they will sell it at a discount as soon as practical. The Labor party are more amenable in a general sense, but are very aware that the last time they did this, the liberals deliberately damaged the project on purpose to avoid giving the Labor party any wins and they hurt the country to do it. For a nuclear plant that's an extremely bad idea. I personally feel if the only way to build a nuclear plant is for both a state and a region (say everyone within 50km of the proposed site) have a plebiscite where they both must agree. Only on dual agreements are all environmental and planning lawsuits on procedural grounds bypassed, since bad faith lawsuits often caused large delays and delays drive around 30-40% of costs. But as I said, the Liberal party would deliberately hurt the project if it was a Labor job and they also would never start it themselves, since they want to privatize everything.",1.1096

He said the “Eden project” was designed to rehabilitate the mine site there, which according to its website will “celebrate the local ecology and tell you the story of sustainability”. It's also a hard no cause that plant has been decommissioned for years, and has 150MW nameplate output aka would be a smol baby nuclear power plant aka not worth doing. The only cheap part would be the transmission lines... Which I am going to go ahead and bet is the cheapest part of a fucking nuclear power plant, before the reactor and the turbines and shit (the last two 100% need replacing or else this is legit ""grandfather nuclear power plant""). To chase nuclear there, would officially put Snowy 2.0 to shame as the worst LNP energy project ever attempted. Why is this a thing?

Their study also referenced some EU reports that had similar findings that yes, random deaths will occur but not more than what was considered incidental. The one thing most of the studies agree on is that the placement of turbines is key and that we should not be just looking to pop them on every hill top. As long as they are placed in known areas that avoid typical migration paths or nesting grounds then they are fine.",1.745

I believe or wind cost is in the $100/MWh range (within $10 of that). Granted there are many factors that they may or may not be including that could make this not perfectly apples to apples.,4.6856
Australia,windpower,"the cost of the carbon tax/trading scheme ($23/ tonne) actually substantially undervalues the total (long term) cost of CO2 emissions, the price will be raised gradually over time to reflect the true cost. So, with LESS than the total cost, coal is still more expensive. We wont know the ""exact"" cost to humanity of CO2 emissions until its too late. There is actually a section of legislation in Australian state laws called the Precautionary Principle, which basically says: in situations of uncertain impacts, we must act with what we DO know to prevent as much environmental damage as possible, rather than waiting around indefinitely for better info (while everything goes to shit). From what is known about fossil fuels and wind power, environmental damage costs in the long term for FF are much greater than wind. Also, on this ""cheap (fossil fuel) energy"" argument: the world will run out of cheap (in the short term costings) fossil fuel energy, so alternatives must be introduced to enable a transnational period. A gradual transition is needed for predictable energy prices, predictable prices encourages economic investment(lower risk investment), which leads to growth and jobs etc. Switching suddenly to another energy generation method when we run out of fossil fuels requires shittonnes of research and development and investment in unproven things etc which causes economic instability(high risk investment) which discourages investment. Im not saying wind is a cure all either, with current technology anyway.",1.8812
Australia,windpower,"I CALL BULLSHIT. Relying on fossil fuels to produce electricity is getting more expensive because of the government’s price on carbon emissions imposed last year, higher financing costs and rising natural gas prices, BNEF said. The cost of wind generation has fallen by 10 percent since 2011 on lower equipment expenses, while the cost of solar power has dropped by 29 percent. They are showing the end PRICE not COST. The end PRICE is lower because Australia subsidizes wind energy while it taxes coal into the ground. The story reports the final PRICE after the government has meddled in the market. The true COST isn't discussed. I understand that... price = cost to the consumer, but the article was very misleading. Cost to consumer (after taxes, subsidies, ect) is not equal to cost to produce.",1.2684

Australia,windpower,"This is the whole point of the Carbon Tax. The idea is to accelerate the economics involved to make developing alternative, carbon neutral generation a more economically enticing option decades earlier than would naturally occur. The Carbon Tax is an input in this equation, to ignore it misses the point completely. This article shows that the carbon tax is working to alter the economics, whether or not it will work to change generation and industry practices is still to be seen.",1.3748
Australia,windpower,"The true COST isn't discussed. Your use of ""true COST"" is quite ironic. Coal has heaps of negative externalities that are normally not factored into the price.
