This Australian billionaire wants to be the worldís green hydrogen baron. Heís pushing Canada to join him. Mining mogul Andrew Forrest made billions by building an iron ore empire. Now he wants to help to save the planet by transforming his company into a global leader in a carbon-free future

comment
He can start by paying taxes
Id rather have a capitalist like him go after it via research and development. Its faster than any government reaearch program. Jeesh
lol!
"South Australia has four times the land are of the UK but less than two million people because much of the land is sun-drenched arid land. There are literally many hundreds of gigawatts of (free) solar energy that could easily be collected, but no grid load for it to serve. So it makes perfect sense to build solar farms that are not connected to the grid at all ... solar farms dedicated to making green hydrogen for export. South Australia's Hydrogen Action Plan | Energy & Mining It sin't at all inefficient to make green hydrogen using free solar energy that can't be used for any other purpose and can't be used on the grid. South Australia has an essentially wind and solar grid (about 2.5x overbuild) firmed at the moment by natural gas. Recently natural gas has become very expensive, and so storage of green hydrogen made from the excess renewable energy on the grid is the plan. Hydrogen Jobs Plan | Energy & Mining After all when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining at the same time South Australia currently has to curtail a considerable amount of its available renewable energy. Curtailing energy is 100% inefficient. Using some of it instead to make and store green hydrogen is far less inefficient."
"It might not be a dead end. This Australian company is claiming that they will start mass production of a 95% efficient electrolyzer soon. Fuel cells in cars are idiotic. But H2 tank farms are a cheap way to store a LOT of energy. Most natural gas power plants can burn a 85% H2 15% methane mix with few modifications and pure H2 with extensive modifications. The game is simply adding too much green energy sources, make H2 with the surplus then burn it when we need it. You could store enough energy for weeks to months. Batteries give us hours. H2 trains, ships and eventually aircraft sounds like a winning strategy too. H2 has twice the power to weight ratio of Jet A and you can store it in a atmospheric dewar as long as some is always boiling off to keep it refrigerated and cool. 1% a day is all you need. It‚Äôs perfect for a fill and go application. Simply running the engine is enough to keep the H2 in a cryogenic state."
"I like to consider myself an ""otherwise-smart"" person (engineer in the renewable industry) and hydrogen is absolutely important for a decarbonized future. I'm surprised your comment got so many upvotes in an energy sub tbh. It's not just an electricity alternative. The Haber-Bosch process is arguably the most important industrial process ever developed (used primarily for the production of fertilizer) and it relies on hydrogen that currently comes from natural gas at a huge carbon cost. And even when it is an electricity alternative, it has an energy density 175x that of li-ion cells. Yes, batteries won the 'format war' for cars, but ships? airplanes? Hydrogen will be important there because of that energy density unless there's some miracle battery breakthrough which seems unlikely. As for cost, green hydrogen is expensive now... but that's largely because it's not produced at scale because there's no demand yet. It also looks like hydrogen is poised to be the dominant 'power-to-X' commodity. In a fully renewable world, there will be lots of curtailment. If electric demand is low, and the wind is blowing, you can either shut your wind turbine off, or use the excess power to make 'free' hydrogen. The latter makes sense and will drive costs down."
"I'm a H2 skeptic but Australia ( and maybe North Africa?) might make sense. In Australia you have millions of acres of land that are from marginal through to desert, with sun 360¬± days a year and very negligible population density. Water is scarce but assuming they're situating plants near the coast then electrolysing water into hydrogen is about as cheap as it gets. The bit I can't work out is how it is viable after shipping costs."
"People and governments are pouring tens of billions into hydrogen. Whether or not you buy the hype, it is a great field for a huckster to make pious statements about saving the world while fleecing everyone involved."
"I understand the snarky comments here, but seriously, would you guys prefer him to be a climate change denier? Even if what he's saying is just rhetoric and he ends up not doing anything, him saying it still helps sway large amounts of people who dismiss climate change unless they hear from literal billionaires. If the only people fighting climate change are leftist activists then we are skrewed."
I upvoted you because reality dictates that fully decarbonizing industry will require massive investments from everyone.
Fuck Andrew Forrest. Energy belongs to the people. It‚Äôs not a investment opportunity for a multibillionaire. The last era was marked by wealthy sociopaths holding societies hostage.
this seems more like an advertisement than a story
"He doesn‚Äôt want to save the world, he wants to make money pretending to do so."
If his billions of dollars actually go to green projects that help save the world then I couldn‚Äôt care less what his intentions are.
I am thinking the same but i don't think it has to be a problem. What we need to do is to create a regulatory environment where people like him automatically choose 'green(er)' projects instead of toxic projects because they can make more money that way. Changing the rules of the game will hurt some businesses of currently successful entrepreneurs but it will create new opportunities for the same people and opportunities for new entrepreneurs. For workers change doesn't have to hurt. Long term it doesn't matter if you work on a green hydrogen installation or a oil refinery.
Look I don't care what his reasons are of he takes billions and puts it to fixing the mess in not going to stop it in fact I'll take some if his money to invest in my own eco projects Like you should do
"selfless billionaires are going to save us, great news!"
They don‚Äôt care about saving the planet they see that this is the future way to more wealth

"I mean, I am not upset and wouldn‚Äôt blame the guy if he just simply says ‚ÄúI want jump the bandwagon and make more money‚Äù. That is a legitimate interest."
If he wants to spend his money going green. And he makes money doing so. I def not stopping him. What‚Äôs his stock ticket I‚Äôll invest too
ASX:FMG
Fortescue is the only listed entity I'm aware (asx)
Finally some good news
As believable as apple environment reason for cutting off charger in iphone
Namibia's also got a nice investment in green hydrogen.
"You do whatever you want, please don‚Äôt waste our tax payers money"
All this bullshit instead of using magnetic induction to smelt his ore into steel.
"You can make molten iron ore, but that wont help you, you will just be left with a lump of red iron ore rock. You need to remove oxygen before you can create steel. Hydrogen is one way, electrolysis is another."
Australian ‚ùå Billionaire ‚ùå
Well let me use my 20 bucks to kickstart it then. I think billionaires are mostly assholes too but i would rather have them invest in this than into new coal plants
He's both of those things.
Bullshit
"No shit. He's investing very heavily into green hydrogen production and into solar (although he's wanting to build shitty thin film) He has self interest of course, making steel green means he still has a product to sell."
"Translation: Some rich asshole is able to pretend to care enough about Earth to do something, while making billions of dollars and controlling the world's energy market. Fuck this rich piece of shit. He can shove his bullshit gas right up his ass! Fuck this rich scumbag!"
Kinda sounds like a more extreme version of Elon Musk.
Chill out dude.



"No That was Rio Tinto. Andrew Forests company is Fortescue. He is dead set on green hydrogen Australia has a great Solar and Wind profile so if he can come up with a way to produce green hydrogen at scale using renewables he may be onto something. Only issue is the ""at scale"""
