Thinking of going solar
"Currently bill 800 quarter. I have cash to spend but also like my buffer. Thinking if I'm spending 800 a quarter whether interest free might work well as it will be like paying my power bill still but paying it off and I can keep my cash in savings.

Anyone done this? Any catches?

Thank you"

"I like to put it in these terms: power from the grid is always going to go up, but buying enough PV to offset your usage you are locking in the price for 10-20 years until something breaks (probably the inverter).
Alternatively, can you get a better investment return elsewhere?"
"Yep, this. Solar is a hedge against rising energy prices and is almost always worth it. Where it isn’t worth it is if you can’t use the solar during the day, but even then washing machines, dryers, dishwashers etc can be set on timers."
Here’s my challenge/advice. Find me anyone who says I wish I hadn’t installed solar. Waste of money. I am yet to come across a person. I know plenty of people who says I wish I had done it sooner and I wish I had gone as big as I could. They are the only 2 regrets you hear. Choice is yours my friend.
"Really? I often get called out to look at systems because the owner still has a power bill when they were promised they wouldn’t. company I work for absolutely bullshits the numbers to get sales, like most do which leaves installers like me looking like a clown when I wasn’t the one selling it. In WA you can’t go above 6.6kw on residential so it’s not going to generate enough power for a home with 4 people. Without the govt rebate it’s hardly worth it for most people, especially ones that are using most of their electricity when the sun isn’t out."
"Solar is like pre-paid electricity for the next 10-15 yrs IMO. Heaps of variables and good for some, crap for others. I don’t think anybody results in pockets full of spare cash because they went solar."
"I live on Qld Gold Coast - so similar climate to you on the Sunshine Coast. I suggest before you make any decisions thoroughly analyse your current electricity usage. If you have a smart meter you should be able to see your usage by the hour or half hour on line (depending on your biller). So you can see your own family's specific usage by time of day. My biggest winter users are the ducted aircon - set to heat from 5am to 7am every day. Followed by cooking the main evening meal - 4.30'ish to 6.30'ish (oven being the biggest user) - and the dishwasher 8pm every night (after the peak time period). Sure I could use the dishwasher when the solar power is being generated but TBH I would find that pretty inconvenient. So the 3 biggest winter power consumers in my house are used when there is no solar generation - so solar would not benefit me at all for the Big 3 - unless I had a battery - which there is no way I could afford. The same Big 3 for summer usage - the aircon - cooling at various times depending on the temperature, by far the biggest summer user. And yes - there would be an opportunity to use some solar generated power for the aircon. But most days there is no way we could turn off the aircon when the panels stop generating solar power and expect our home to stay cool for hours after that so we could sleep in a cool house - as I have seen in some comments - our house would heat up again in no time! And yes we have roof insulation - and have draught proofed our home etc. Our main cooking would still be 4.30 to 6.30'ish and dishwasher 8pm - both when no solar power would be generated. Note: I have LPG instant HWS - which will probably be replaced with electric when it dies. My cooktop is one gas ring (used infrequently) and 2 induction . I thoroughly researched solar about 4 months ago. Our roof space is not large - and we do not have the space for a vast array of panels to be installed. We were being quoted on 6.6 'ish systems. All the salesman's cost benefit analysis were based on some type of average usage, not truly specific to when I actually use the most power. When I did my own analysis using my specific usage times my results were very different to what the salesmen were telling me! I decided against solar - could not justify the expense for such a small system (without storage) at my age. The feed in tariff is low and will only go lower. Plus there is a real risk that my single level home will be in the shadow of a high rise within the next 5-10 years. Don't rely on the accuracy of the salesmen's cost benefit analysis - do your own analysis using your own time of day usage - and don't bank on the feed in tariff being there forever."
"What are your usage patterns like? Where is most of the electricity going, and at what times? On the finance side, there are various low/no interest loans: https://www.energy.gov.au/rebate-type/loan https://brighte.com.au/homeowners/interest-free"
"Getting solar installed next week, using a green loan from CBA (3%) There's someone WFH at least 3 days a week + weekend so we're already using a lot of power in the day doing washing / dryer, computers etc. Battery off the cards this year, maybe when they come down in price or at the same price can store more like 25-30kWh instead of ~15."
I install solar and depending on the size system and price you are looking at a 2.7-4yr payback and 25yr product warranty. They should last much longer. What network area are you in? Ergon have a decent feed in atm.
"I work in the industry. It’s 100% worth it. A starting point is a 6.6kw system which you should find around $6000 for quality. Don’t look at the cheap crap like $4000 for a 6.6kw. Garbage on your roof. I know Origin solar can do up to 5y interest free payment plans… ask for this, they don’t always offer it upfront. Your solar system can highly likely yield a full ROI within that interest free period."
"Solar in our days without battery backup is a waist. When I had my 13.5kw system installed, I was getting an average of $400 a quarter refund. But with the way the power bills are now, I've just had to battle my power company to give me a better feed-in tariff, so I'm still covering the power bill every quarter. A few years ago, it was smart to outlay the cash for solar because when I did it, I was getting a $600 bill that became a $400 credit. So my out of pocket was $5500. I would have been paying $2400 in power bills in 12 months, but I got $1600 back. So, the investment was basically paid off in 15 months. So then I was getting 25% return on my investment from there after. And like someone else stated, I was just leaving my ac on all day while I was at work and wasn't coping power bills and coming home to a fresh cool house in summer."
Just hope nothing will block your solar.
"We recently put a pool in and put solar in at the same time offset the cost of running the pool. We've just had our first electricity bill and it's maybe $80is less than it was without the pool and solar last quarter, so still around $550 a quarter with $80 back for what we fed into the grid. With solar we had to get a digital metre and we've discovered we use most of our power at night time so there is no real change. If power companies actually paid a decent amount back for feed in it would be great. I have no regrets though."
Wow is that it? 80 bucks less per bill? Would take a bloody decade to pay it off
"With Amber, if it's windy/or sunny, power can go down to $0.07 kwh. Most of today it was about $0.11 for me in Vic. I'm renting, no solar. I think the true cost of grid power is better measured by this. So if I had solar, on a day of strong solar generation, I would be saving say $0.12 per kwh, not $0.28 which is the best traditional rate I can get now, after Aug 1. That changes the payback, I imagine. It can peak higher after; today at 17:30 it will go up to $0.20 but $0.50 is not unusual. But solar may not be so productive at 17:30 in August, so I wouldn't be saving $0.50 at 17:30 In fact today was very cloudy, the cheap power is due to wind."
"I used https://www.solarquotes.com.au/solar-calculator/ I suggest get the max solar you can put on your roof. North East and West sides Depending on your usage, a battery may save you a lot."
"I think a small solar system plus a battery with ""Amber for batteries"" smart shift would be as good as a large solar system now. Charge off low grid prices during the day and night to use during peak power times."
"We got an 11 KW system installed and its coming up on a year now since installation. In total we have had to pay $101 in bills compared to upwards of $1500 per annum previously. And we are in Canberra so the reverse cycle air con gets a workout heating in the winter months. However we got the interest free loan the ACT government provided (which they have now effectively canned) so that changed the equation a bit for us. We combined the panel installations with the largest sized heat pump hot water heater we could get which has also greatly reduced our gas bills (previously continuous gas hot water heater). In retrospect, I wish I had covered the whole roof with more panels."
Being a solar powered human does sound beneficial until we have no sun and you can’t move at all.
100% It doesn't hurt to get some quotes See if your current energy provider will install it. Origin gave me 2k off because I'm an existing customer. Plus another 2.5k rebate from the government.
"Solar is only good if you’re at home during the day to use it, unless you spend cash on a battery as well. The feed in Tarif has been obliterated and no longer worth it. I’ve got 19kw on my roof with an 8kw battery and I have just started getting a bill again…. :("
"It's great running the air-con all day during a heatwave.
Go to bed in a nice 18 degree bedroom."
"Is there a cheap way to get solar just for selected areas? Ie, can I hook up my shed to solar and have it off the grid (and get some affordable batteries)? Basically, I'd like to initially dabble with solar WITHOUT the daily supply charge being impacted . Thanks"
A bit weird but yeh. Get a camping system and use low voltage lighting. Forget about high loads like welding and electric power tools. However you could add an inverter to use 240v for power tool chargers.
