"Australia must seize ëhydrogen tipping pointí or miss clean energy revolution, experts say | Australia news"

comment
Has australia ever seized any opportunity at the right time?
Women‚Äôs voting rights?
We're great at flogging off everything not bolted down to overseas companies who make profit? That's uh.. Something we're good at I guess?
"Spoiler alert....... Australia will dither, hold committee's and then use it as a political football for the next few years."
While digging up coal and pumping out gas.
"This is an industry puff-piece. One of the ""experts"" being quoted credulously by the ""lefty"" Guardian here is Matt Hingerty, former long-time CEO and MD of Barton Deakin, an ""openly partisan"" government relations and ""lobbying"" firm. This was preceded by roles as Chief of Staff for a former NSW nationals leader, Managing Director for a tourism industry body at the time Scott Morrisson was Managing Director of Tourism Australia, and a Chief of Staff role for Joe Hockey. That's without touching on the rest of those offering their opinion to this former BusinessDay Managing Editor for Fairfax."
The answer 20 years ago was nuclear for the next 30 to 40 years. I fail to see how the collective Australian mind can come to a good decision about energy.
"Mining interests will use their considerable resources to influence our politicians. The destruction of the mining super profits tax demonstrates how much power it has. If there's to be reform, the mining lobby's influence needs to be destroyed or severely curtailed. Simply putting pressure on Labor is insufficient."
Hydrogen is not clean if produced with fossil fuels. Don't buy into the greenwashing scam.
Green/white hydrogen is the only way to go üíö ü§ç
'expert' or 'salesman'? the case for hydrogen is stupid...batteries can do pretty much everything cheaper and better.
"Hydrogen is the logical fuel replacement for long haul routes not logistically serviceable via rail. Battery‚Äôs unless we have an orders of magnitude increase in power density are unable to adequately supply long distance haulage. Remember for every ton of batteries is a ton less of cargo. One of the benefits to hydrogen is it‚Äôs compatible with EV technology, you‚Äôre just using a different energy storage method so they‚Äôre complementary technologies. WA Is investing heavily into Green hydrogen Generation for use as energy storage and for use in coal free steel in the Pilbara with 800% of our current national energy needs planned in generating capacity. Hydrogen is only expensive because it‚Äôs not being mass produced, hey presto mass production solves this. Hydrogen also solves the gap issue with renewable power generation, when there minimal wind and solar generation you can use the hydrogen generated using the previous excess solar and wind to fill the gap until wind and solar picks up again, currently the system would be to fire up more gas in the turbines. Continuing the reliance on fossil fuels."
How is battery better and cheaper? And this question comes from a automotive battery sales rep.

"The cost of producing hydrogen outweighs its benefits, experts say."
"Will we do that? No chance in hell. Albo's mob are still scared of their shadow....you can hardly blame them, they've been well trained by the fickle electorate and the corrupt media, but they won't be sticking their neck out any time soon."
"Anyone who talk about H2 as a fuel is either a liar, innumerate or a scammer or possibly all three."
We will miss this....the LNP will rally against it and Labor will loose their balls
"If someone produced a million tonnes of hydrogen tomorrow, what would we do with it? Could we store it? No. Is there a use for it? No. I believe there are only a couple of vehicles in the country that could use it. If we had a thousand hydrogen cars, could they use the gas? No, because there's no distribution system. But there is electricity. It's available everywhere. There are already thousands of EV's to use it. Much better, if the Government incentivised the uptake of EV's, say, by way of subsidies, tax deductions, or registration reduction."
"You have a point, but this does miss that there are already industries that use millions of tonnes per annum of ‚Äògrey‚Äô hydrogen (from methane) as a feedstock - primarily fertilisers, explosives, and refineries. Even just replacing this with your million tonnes of H2 would be a huge decarbonisation benefit. Problem is, it‚Äôs not cost effective to do so when competing in fossil-based global fertiliser supply chains."
"A sad sales pitch to get taxpayer funds into the wrong private hands. Hydrogen isn't economical as other green fuels. Hydrogen has an efficiency of around 30% maximum when compared to electricity EV at 90-95%. No industry is stupid enough to pay 3x as much for it's fuel. It's 3x more expensive than 'green' diesel (co2 offset diesel) The compression and storage systems we have that brittle, rupture and explode trying to contain the smallest molecule in the universe have been working on since the 50's with billions already sunk into it with zero improvements in containment. It still leaks. And it still explodes. Australia has no local advantage in its production (green hydrogen) because all it needs is power and water. Every country has access to power and water. Why make it here to ship it (adding costs to it) when other countries, if it was viable, can make it locally? It's been proven by researchers hundreds of times to be a dead-end technology. The only economic case found has been in the world mandates hydrogen use 100% for industry and 50% for transport energy and then for some dumb reason they buy it from us because they don't have power or water over our LNG export quantities. Heavy haulage has found electric hot swap or carbon offset diesel is much much much cheaper. There's a host of other technical issues suffice to say there have now been a half dozen hydrogen fueling station explosions and some countries have banned it because after independent review it became obvious that it doesn't work. All car manufacturers have stopped plans and dumped tech for mass production of hydrogen cars. Fun fact, the LPG system we have was government paid, and there are something like 1000 LPG cars in all of Australia now. If we sink billions and billions into it, the final product because the economics are so much better in any industry, will be service stations all having a little hydrogen tank that the government has to service using taxes to maintain the 1000 hydrogen cars that get purchased around australia for the next 30 years. A stupid investment with 0 return. Meanwhile, we have to endure 30 years of sky news and Murdoch screaming that Labors stupid for not investing and creating a new oil and gas industry that leaves us economically uncompetitive against other countries."
"""Green"" Hydrogen is a deception. It offers the best opportunities to divert finances, eg government money, in ways where it can be manipulated for , let's say alternate, purposes. Huge amounts. Billions $$$"
 
"If the ""green left crowd"" actually wanted energy rationing, all they'd have to do is wait a few years - Australia, and much of the western world, is on the cusp of not having sufficient energy because ""capitalism"" has failed to increase capacity with existing technology, or plan for renewal/refurbishment/replacement of already-existing capacity. Let alone being hugely resistant to alternatives..."
