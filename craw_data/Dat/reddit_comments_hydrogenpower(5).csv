Australia: Tasmanian Government to invest $50m in hydrogen power plan

comment
"The plan indicates that a 1,000MW renewable hydrogen facility (approximately enough power for 1 million households) Except households don’t run on hydrogen. So you are using renewable sources to create electricity to then lose 70% to turn into hydrogen and then what? Renewable hydrogen is produced by purifying seawater, then separating the hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis So if I use renewable energy to power an oil refinery, I can then call the oil renewable oil right? Or green oil? Or natural oil? And the otherwise is that Tasmania also has power problems in of itself where a few years ago they used their pumped hydro dams to sell energy to another state so much so they didn’t have much water left in the dams, then a drought happened and they ran out of electricity."
"So if I use renewable energy to power an oil refinery, I can then call the oil renewable oil right? Uh, no. In that case the energy source of the fuel is oil. With electrolysed sea water, the energy source is renewable, stored in the hydrogen. turn into hydrogen and then what? Shipping, high temperature processes, chemical feedstocks, balancing long periods of low renewable output..."
Mate you have to count things in households. And water in Sydney harbours. And pollution reduction in cars off the road. Otherwise the punters wont know how big it is. Tasmania has huge amounts of renewable energy potential. It just needs some industry to soak it up. A 2 million ton p.a. aluminium smelter ought to do it.
