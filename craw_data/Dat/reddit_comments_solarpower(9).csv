Are solar panels worth it?
"First time homeowner here. Given we will soon be in El Nina I was looking at channelling the power of the brutal Brissie sun. What sort of costs are we looking at? What companies are reliable, any government rebates etc? Live in Southeast Brisbane if that matters"

Solar is 100% worth it. Get your self a Catch Power Relay with your system. It doubles up as a consumption monitor and will only use the excess solar before you send it back to the grid. Your power bills will disappear if you use it properly. Always use a company with all the CEC approvals etc. The companies you see all over social media are all scammers.
Edit: The list someone else pointed to was a CEC seller list not a installer. So Positronics are in fact accredited installers. Just a heads up Positronics who did my install and have been in operation longer than most and have one of the best reputations in Brisbane are not CEC accredited. I believe this is because the owner is not happy with how the whole thing is run and many companies who are accredited are shonky anyway. The whole industry needs a clean out and overhaul with inspections after install and fines/shutting down of dodgy installers.
"Yes. Especially if you have young kids who are still at home and/or have family and/or significant other staying at home - especially during the way. Plus even if you don’t then the solar feed ins help to either offset your costs and in some cases neutralise or give you a cost deficit (so you will make money). Tip for those who don’t know. Sign up for origin to then to someone like ovo who offer 14c/kWh solar feed ins - the origin then team will bring you back at 20c/kWh for the first 14kwh every day and 5c after that. But origin won’t offer that to new customers. For me this means I feed in average $3.50 per day or $1200 per year. This is on top of my zero usage from 9am to 6pm (roughly…longer during summer). Paying off the solar + my night time electricity usage costs me $800 a quarter. It uses to cost me $1400 a quarter way back before the recent price hike. So solar has saved me $2,400 a year. Worth it."
Look at the website solarquotes.com.au and also don't use Modern group.
Yea it’s a no brainer. I’m also a big fan of solar hot water. The hot water storage is effectively a battery to use later
Solar hot water is not as good as straight solar in that space and having your HWS on a timeclock to run during peak sun off said solar. Once that water gets hot on the roof it's wasted space that regular solar could otherwise be using for something else/feed out.
Fun fact. You can have water cooled solar panels now. Not only does that increase the efficiency of the panels but it allows for not only solar power but hot water storage as well.
"Solar is a great investment, absolutely worth it. Last I checked batteries weren't worth it but that may have changed with recent power price rises and feed in tariff changes. I used solarquotes when I organised installation, they also have a bunch of helpful articles."
1000% worth it. Budget ~$1000 pew kW for good quality gear. Use local businesses not any company that uses a washed up cricketer to flog the cheapest shit possible.
"One word, yes, especially if you can run your washing machine, dishwasher, oven, cooking, aircons (wfh) in day time. Rest I don’t know, I bought a house which already came with panels."
"My mum has them and her bill is always in credit to her, a 4 brm house. I hate her for that lol whilst my quarterly bill just arrived at just over $400 for little old me in a unit. She says it’s the best thing her late partner made them invest in. Do it."
Completely worth it. We have outlaid quite a few $s upfront to get a solar/battery combo and our payback period has gone from an initial 2.4 years to 1.8 years due to switching to EVs and the rising cost of electricity.
"Solar is definitely worth it. Don’t go a cheap system and get burned in the long run when the system ages and your installer has gone out of business! I have a 15kw Fronius inverter and 15kw of Qcell panels with batteries and it’s still not enough now I have an electric car. I used Gi Energy to install and they were excellent, not a bad word to say."
"Yep. My power bills went from as high as $2000 per quarter to about $90. House slams through the power. Averaging 50-60 kwh per day. Turns out electric water heater, pool pump, ducted air con, dryer chews through juice. Went overboard and installed 23 kw longi panels with 20 kw fronius inverter (~$13k with i-tech electrical). Will pay for itself in 3 years. So work out your payback time and see if it's worth it for you. Edit - Should note that our house has massive pool pump, and a massive electric heater. So that's most of the cost. 20 kw aircon doesn't help either - used sparingly via home assistant. It's not like I'm Electro or anything"
If you're home to use electricity yes. If you're out most of the day no.
We put a pool in and added solar at the same time so the pool has really had no affect on our elec bills. We still use far too much electricity at night time so our last bill was $530 less $80 feed in credits.
"Yes. Especially if you can get off gas as well and have a storage electric hot water system you can divert excess generation to. In terms of cost, a rule of thumb is $1k per KW panels installed. The rebate is less a rebate and more the sale of the small scale technology certificates your system will generate. But federal government rebate is the layman’s terms for it. You usually sign the STCs over to the installer for a discount on the system price. I paid $6.5k for a 6.6kw QCell panels and 5KW Fronius Gen 24 inverter just under a year ago from Keen2BGreen and very happy with it. Second time I’ve used them for solar systems. Yes, being able to self consume power is best for your return on investment, but even if you’re not home during the day it is still worthwhile. FiTs aren’t what they were but are still good."
Yes… but get a good quality inverter. We’re looking to get a battery wall next so we can avoid the blackouts at night and keep our fans on during the hot summer nights.
I put solar on about 10 years ago with the stupidly generous 49c FiT so I never have a bill to pay for power. Normally I have over $500 credit each QTR. Summer it's close to $1000 even running ac. I probably wouldn't bother now though if feed in tariff is under 10c.
"Yes, I've not paid one bill since putting solar on. Include local company Positronics in your list to get quotes from."

"I just had a system quoted last week and it was not worth proceeding. 7 years before I even broke even. However, I only have a small portion of my roof north facing, so was only able to fit 4kw max on the correct angle. A bigger system would have broken even a lot quicker.  Edit. A big piece I was missing here was that someone is WFH 4 days a week. And it still took 7 years to break even."
"Solar is definitely worth it, especially if you plan on living in your home more than 3 years. I work in the solar industry in SEQ and can tell you that Solarquotes.com.au you will absolutely get quotes from reputable companies. Look for a NETCC certified retailer as well as CEC installers as there are pretty strict guidelines that have to be followed. Look for something that’s got a return on investment between 3-5 years and make sure the self consumption figure outlined on the proposal isn’t jacked up to 80%. Self consumption should be the amount of solar power produced that will actually be used within the home and for most people doesn’t really exceed 40-50% (depending on size of solar and personal circumstances, usually is a fair bit lower). Look at installing a catchpower solar relay or if you want a cheaper alternative you could just install a basic timer if you have a standard hot water cylinder on off peak. There are alternatives to this but that gets further into the weeds. Also wait until you have your solar installed and your meter changed (if this is required - your solar retailer should know this) before you change energy plans as this can cause quite a few complications if done half way through. Hope this helps but solar is defs worth it, you won’t look back."
I've tracked all my raw usage. ~4 year payback period and then free money.
"Ducted aircon, clothes dryer, pool pump, every electrical appliance known to man - it's a must have."
"I am not a homeowner but I used to work in a solar related job, absolutely it’s worth it. Keep in mind it may not completely rid you of your electricity bill - you still have to pay the daily fee and if you’re a large elec user during the night, no battery, you’ll pull from the grid. Some solar companies will oversell that aspect, so keep that in mind. But it is a great investment, I believe it adds on to your property value. My mum got it put on her place way up north where it rains more and she’s a very conservative elec user so her bill usually pays itself."
I believe it adds on to your property value. When people buy a house they know solar is only worth $7k-$12k and it is simple to get installed.
If you get the honeymoon deal from Origin it can pay for itself in three years. Get off gas and get a timer on your water heater.
How do you get this?
"Hey mate, I am in the same boat. Have a look at the comparison site Wattever for some information. They recommend using Teho as a solar expert to help you, they seem to have good reviews"
If your roof faces north or west then yes. You’ll need to do you’re high energy items like washing during the day and cooking if possible but if you just cover the daily connection charge you will be in front
"And def get water tanks, have 2 off marketplace. Save heaps on water"
We got our a year ago and so far they've been 100% worth it yes
It's worth it. I don't pay electricity and the solar panels paid themselves off within 2 years
"Just installed ours. First time solar owners. Honestly the bigger the system them better. But in my opinion, solar is not really worth it unless you use bulk of your power through the day. A solar battery on the other hand would be entirely worth it. Just my opinion"
Yes Providing your inverter doesn’t flood
"We're an energy hungry household. We put a 31 panel system in (basically maxed out what we could fit on the roof). All panels are on Enphase micro-inverters to maximise efficiency (if one panel is compromised by shadow, bird crap, or failure, it won't take the others down with it). Produces 80kWh on a clear day in summer and 45kw a day in winter. We generally burn through about 30-40kWh per day but it fully fits inside the solar production in summer, mostly all in winter, and therefore our quarterly energy grid bill is about $200 instead of $2000. Half of that cost is just the daily supply charge. We try to make the vast majority of our energy just during the day rather than overnight, since the feed-in tariff we get is rubbish and will disappear one day anyway. We paid off our system in less than 2.5 years. Well worth it is an understatement. Our installer was Solaray. Very neat work and all equipment is on the inside garage wall instead of on the outside wall, which looks cleaner."
We chew through 40-50kwh per day in summer but are on single phase so the biggest system we could install is 10kw inverter with 13 of panels. Have been quoted 5k to upgrade to 3 phase but stuck comparing that to the cost of a battery. A battery would allow us to store and use and then also oversized the panels up to 18 depending on which inverter company we go with. Any ideas which would be the better way to go?
NOOOOOOO
Watch out. The sky is falling in. I seen a friend's solar setup bill yesterday. He got 4 dollars feed in credit last month. The month before he got 3. It'll pay for itself in no time.
Simple answer is yes.
"We have 12 panels from REA solar and are about to get another 6 installed in the next few months, waiting on that tax return cash. 100% worth it. And O also highly recommend REA solar."
"Okay - there’s so much BS about solar - I’ve been triggered, let me lay some truth down for you. Just cause u have the kilowatt potential, doesn’t mean you will get it. Nearly all of your peak generation happens when you’re not home (at work presumably not WFH). Your energy provider will offer you 1:10 of the value of the power that they bill on to others. Any shade at all on a panel will wipe out the panels in the same circuit. So don’t bother if they aren’t going to get full Sun. You gotta clean them or their generation potential goes down fast. A good bird poo is the same as a shadow. So if you’re not good on the roof yourself, it’ll never make economical sense hiring people. Rebates are all essentially over, credit schemes are gobbled up by crafty sales people who sell you the install. The only way solar makes sense, is if you spring for a battery as well. Otherwise you’re just giving power away for others to profit from and paying through the nose when u need it. Any battery you’re getting subsidised through an energy provider will mean ur signing up to their virtual power plant shit - which only benefits them. Lots of people out there will have an objection to what I’ve written above, think about it for your personal circumstances. A lot of the people who say it’s great installed years ago when it WAS great, they’re basically the boomer property owners of solar installs"
"Thing about the battery though is one can really only store ~$2.50-3.00 of power per day. If you perfectly emptied that 10kwh worth of power every day, payback time for a battery is > 13 years. So at the moment I don't think they make economic sense. (Correct me if I am wrong) Solar on the other hand... in summer I generate 140kwh on a good day. My bills are basically gone, even with a trash FIT, and i use alot of power. My water heater, pool pump are on timer with solar. They use about 35 kwh/day. If I use aircon I'm up for a further 40 kWh or so. A battery ain't going to help with that."
Point 4 is incorrect if you use a system with micro inverters.
Well said. But the systems are still subsidised somewhat right ?
