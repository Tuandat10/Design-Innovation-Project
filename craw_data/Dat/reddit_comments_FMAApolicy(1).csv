"The Coalition has attacked the production credits aspect of the package, which offers up to $7 billion of tax support for the processing and refining of critical minerals, describing them as ‚Äúbillions to billionaires‚Äù. Because we all know the Coalition hate giving billions to billionaires"
Production credits are better than handouts - production earns credits You get nothing for nuffink !
"Roll the dice with our labour rates, our environmental standards & our cost of power in an international marketplace."
"Aiming for more economic complexity is good, but I'm still skeptical that any countries will be willing to pay a premium for our product, let alone domestic consumers. Nickel has been something of a 'canary in the coalmine' in this regard with most manufacturers opting for cheaper, 'dirty' Indonesian nickel for example, and that's only raw nickel itself without any additional level of (expensive) value-add manufacturing on top of it. Companies/countries will talk the talk on ESG, but price is still often the determining factor."
"Have to factor in the value of energy security. If the big country thats selling us all our solar panels, stops selling us solar panels, then an (expensive) local industry will be invaluable"
"I think this is good policy, commercialising the transition to renewables makes perfect sense."
"See here: https://jalopnik.com/ev-battery-manufacturers-pollute-to-keep-up-with-demand-1850145011 Across the Timor Sea, supplying the market Aus has to compete in."
"The Australian government picking winners and losers is not good policy. The Productivity Commision knows this, everyone with half a brain and has watched the spectacular fails by the public service attempting it in the past knows this. Companies need to stand on their own two feet. Make the field equal if you want to subsidise things, drop the taxes for all, create economic zones for anyone to flourish in, don't opaquely choose some companies to ""win"" at the detriment of those trying to compete in the same space. It's all spin and Trumpesque nonsense coming from the Labor government."
"Who doesn‚Äôt want more domestic manufacturing, but would love to understand the detail around an industry where we could theoretically have a competitive edge that could sustain itself, even with subsidies."
Competitive edge is hard when it is measured in a vacuum. We will never be cheaper than China. Geopolitical risk needs to be included in any analysis. We also have an advantage when friendly partners are looking for processed minerals from friendly nations with good ESG credentials.
"An example is Advanced Navigation on the manufacturing side. Australia has some decent ability to test this kind of high tech manufacturing in the field and have a good iteration feedback loop, since we have land/water to do it. Another example is Agritech/robotics manufacturing with examples like Swarmfarm. As mentioned in the article, critical minerals, green hydrogen and quantum computing are all new areas which no-one has a clear advantage on yet, so worth a shot to beat others."
Who doesn‚Äôt want more domestic manufacturing The LNP?
"Ffs, SMH cant even do the most basic of factchecks. These people cited in the article are not economists by training. None of them are in the economics department. Bradon Ellem is a historian. Svenja Keele is a geographer. Nick McGuigan is an accountant. Bronwen Morgan is a lawyer. John Falzon is a sociologist. Lynne Chester and Gareth Bryant are in the political economy department, as is Elizabeth Thurbon (whose specialty seems to be international relations). If the SMH wants to talk to an economist who supports Future Made in Australia, they should speak to Greg Jericho. He, at least, is an economist."
"What? From UNSW website: Bradon Ellem is a Professor of Employment Relations in the University of Sydney Business School where he teaches in both the undergraduate and postgraduate programs, mostly in the fields of industrial relations policy and comparative industrial relations. Monash Uni (Svenja Keele): My research engages with the geographical political economies of climate change adaptation and related challenges including disaster resilience and energy transitions. I am particularly interested in the way government, business and expertise interact to shape policy choices and create new frontiers for investment and innovation. I draw on both qualitative and quantitative social science methodologies, with a focus on spatial processes and inequalities. Monash Uni (Nick McGuigen): Professor Nick McGuigan is an award-winning educator who works as an innovator, instigator and disruptor in Monash Business School to create future¬≠‚Äêoriented business education programs that focus on innovation, creativity and design thinking. He is both a Professor of Accounting and Director of Equity, Diversity and Social Inclusion for the Monash Business School and Professor of Accounting at Rostock University, Germany. I‚Äôm not doing the rest. Do better research instead of pretending."
"From what I can see, the majority of the ""experts"" listed in the article are not experts in this field. The only one that has looked at this issue is Elizabeth Thurbon. But it's hard to judge how credible she actually is from my quick search. Still, being generous, for 7 of the 8 this is entirely out of their field of expertise and their views should be taken with a grain of salt. Details of each below. Lynne Chester - ""She is recognised as a leading Australian scholar in the empirical application of French R√©gulation theory, a heterodox (non-conventional) school of economic thought inspired by Marxian and Institutional Economics, to advancing understanding of contemporary energy issues."" https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/lynne-chester.html Bradon Ellem - ""Bradon Ellem is a Professor of Employment Relations in the University of Sydney Business School where he teaches in both the undergraduate and postgraduate programs, mostly in the fields of industrial relations policy and comparative industrial relations."" https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/about/our-people/academic-staff/bradon.ellem.html Svenja Keele - ""My research engages with the geographical political economies of climate change adaptation and related challenges including disaster resilience and energy transitions."" https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/svenja-keele Nick McGuigan - ""His research interests include student conceptions of learning, diversity and social justice, integrated thinking and creativity, innovation, systems design and behavioural change, where he is a sought-after international speaker. "" https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/nicholas-mcguigan Bronwen Morgan - ""I joined UNSW Law School in October 2012, having taught at the University of Bristol, UK for seven years as Professor of Socio-legal Studies."" https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/bronwen-morgan Elizabeth Thurbon - ""Elizabeth's research examines the state and its strategic role in the process of national techno-industrial development, adaptation, and transformation. Her most significant contributions to the field examine varieties of economic statecraft, the rise and transformation of East Asia's developmental states, the state's strategic role in the clean energy shift, and the political economy of international trade and investment agreements, with a particular focus on the impact of these agreements on states' policy 'room to move'. She has written widely on these topics for academic and popular audiences."" https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/elizabeth-thurbon John Falzon - ""I am a poet and sociologist living on unceded Ngunnawal land."" https://au.linkedin.com/in/john-falzon Gareth Bryant - ""Gareth is a political economist who researches how public policy and public finance can create more sustainable, equal and democratic economies. His research has focused on issues including climate finance, renewable energy, higher education, housing, labour and Indigenous justice."" https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/gareth-bryant.html EDIT: Added one to the list that I initially didn't see. So instead of 6 out of 7, it's now 7 out of 8. I also see that some other comments have questioned Elizabeth Thurbon. Her bio reads that she may have some expertise. I'll leave it as is. Regardless, the point is still well made though. These ""experts"" highlighted by the SMH don't have the expertise in this field."
"Lmao, what is the field? ‚ÄúEconomics‚Äù? Do you think economics is just micro and macro, supply and demand? What would a professor of industrial relations at UNSW know about a major economic government policy!"
"You forgot one. Gareth Bryant - ""Gareth is a political economist who researches how public policy and public finance can create more sustainable, equal and democratic economies. His research has focused on issues including climate finance, renewable energy, higher education, housing, labour and Indigenous justice."" https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/gareth-bryant.html You also fail to take into account that almost 70 have used the letter, both the article and the commenters here are cherry picking. But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation‚Äôs economic development. A government investment into Australian made renewables is a smart and forward thinking idea."
"It all seems pretty relevant to me, what titles do you want them to have? People get more and more specialized in academia, doesn't mean they forget everything outside their niche"
"A large group of economists has backed the federal government‚Äôs Future Made in Australia policy, accusing critics of consigning the country to an ‚Äúextract and export‚Äù business model while ignoring the potential for hundreds of thousands of well-paying industrial jobs. The economists and policy experts, from institutions including the universities of Sydney, Melbourne, NSW, Monash, Western Australia and Newcastle, have signed an open letter declaring Anthony Albanese‚Äôs $23 billion budget plan represents a chance to rebuild the manufacturing sector and support regional jobs while slashing greenhouse gas emissions. In last month‚Äôs federal budget, the government unveiled a suite of measures, including production credits to support the development of critical minerals and green hydrogen, plus direct investment in quantum computing. Key elements of the policy have been criticised by some economists, including the Productivity Commission, as a possible waste of money due to the government in effect ‚Äúpicking winners‚Äù. But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation‚Äôs economic development. Loading Accusing the Productivity Commission and other critics of knee-jerk responses predicated on ‚Äúoutdated laissez-faire thinking‚Äù, the economists say the world of economic statecraft is changing rapidly, which threatens to leave Australia behind. ‚ÄúAustralia faces a vital choice. Decades of policy neglect for manufacturing, combined with support (including subsidies) for mineral extraction and export, have left Australia with a distorted and unbalanced economy,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúAmong all OECD nations, Australia has the smallest manufacturing base (relative to overall GDP and employment) and is most reliant on net imports of manufactures to meet its own growing needs for manufactured products. ‚ÄúThis exposes Australia to a wide range of economic, social, environmental and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, powerful corporate interests keep pressuring to extend and expand their extract and export business model.‚Äù Among those to sign the letter are the University of Sydney‚Äôs Lynne Chester and Bradon Ellem, Monash University‚Äôs Svenja Keele and Nick McGuigan, the University of NSW‚Äôs Bronwen Morgan and Elizabeth Thurbon, and Australian National University‚Äôs John Falzon. In the budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the Future Made in Australia package would help the country become an ‚Äúindispensable‚Äù part of the global economy by attracting investment in key industries and making the nation an energy superpower. The Coalition has attacked the production credits aspect of the package, which offers up to $7 billion of tax support for the processing and refining of critical minerals, describing them as ‚Äúbillions to billionaires‚Äù. Several high-profile economists, including long-time independent analyst Chris Richardson, have raised concerns the program will in effect amount to smoking ‚Äú$100 notes‚Äù. But one of the organisers of the letter, the chair of discipline for political economy at Sydney University, Gareth Bryant, said it was important to show there was support for a policy that recognised the changed global economic environment. ‚ÄúWe decided to organise this letter to put on record our support for Australia joining the emerging global consensus around the need for governments to actively drive and steer the green transformation of our economy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe support the Future Made in Australia agenda as an important step in this direction, but we also want to push the government to make sure it is getting a return on its investments for workers, regions, and the environment, rather than handing out a blank cheque to the private sector.‚Äù The economists said Australia had become overly dependent on raw resources that had diverted labour and investment into one small area that led to an overvalued Australian dollar, distorted fiscal policy and added to regional imbalances. They said Australia, without a policy such as that proposed by the federal government, risked missing a ‚Äúhistoric opportunity‚Äù to rebuild the economy. ‚ÄúWe could continue exporting raw minerals (including critical minerals like lithium). But we would squander opportunities to add value to those minerals and develop a more diversified and sustainable industrial mix,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWe would remain on the losing end of lopsided trade relations, selling unprocessed resources to buy back more expensive value-added products (like transmission equipment, batteries and electric vehicles). ‚ÄúOur future prosperity would be jeopardised by failure to seize the economic and industrial opportunities of the global energy transition.‚Äù"
"Key elements of the policy have been criticised by some economists, including the Productivity Commission, as a possible waste of money due to the government in effect ‚Äúpicking winners‚Äù. But this masthead can reveal that almost 70 economists have used their letter, a copy of which has been obtained by this masthead, to reject the criticism as short-sighted and a threat to the nation‚Äôs economic development. I must also say that criticism is a shortsighted one. The US is struggling with teriff against Chinese imports because the US has not position to rebuild its industry, as its economies cannot cope with such a move. It's too little too late for the US. And the teriffs are only good for self-destruction. AU can do something good for the future."
Link? 'this masthead' ?
"Nice headline. But when your spokesperson is a ‚Äúpluralist, heterodox and radical‚Äù economist, then it‚Äôs a reasonable bet the ‚Äòeconomists‚Äô on this list also sit well outside mainstream opinion."
OR: the SMH chose to highlight this in an effort to discredit everyone involved. But I'm sure a paper chaired by Peter Costello has no interest in misleading their audience to trash a Labor party policy. Perish the thought.
 
"Except quantum computing is a real field of research you donut, don't comment on things you know nothing about"
Cause rampant capitalism is working out so well for the younger generation. I don‚Äôt blame them for wanting a change
I'm not sure how a controlled economy has anything to do with autarky here.
Controlled economies are the best economies.
"Quantum computing is nothing like Theranos lmao. Why are all right wing schitzos pushing back against any form of market diversification? We can't just keep exporting raw materials and buying them back as products at a premium, there will come a day where the grade of materials will be too low and costly to dig out and then what will the free market do? There's nothing marxist about a capitalist government making initiatives for capital investors."
