"We have a pretty big one about 30km from us. That probably doesn’t seem all that close, but it’s on the other side of the nearest small town. I don’t recall the town getting anything much from the company, but they built a nice little viewing area where you can look over the turbines. We still only have one option for provider out our way. Hasn’t impacted my daily life, other than my kid always asking to stop for a squizz whenever we go past. Rural NSW."
"Where I used to live in rural Vic, the company dished out annual grants to local groups etc. I remember we got an upgraded walking and bike track, wildlife hides, upgraded fishing jetties."
Rural Vic. The companies give out pretty healthy grants regularly to local groups. Most sporting community / groups have done very well out of the windfarms. Roads are far noisier than the turbines.
The 5g antivax chemtrail flat earthers will come at you with all sorts of brainbroken nonsense about eagle mulching migraine machines ruining their views of pristine wilderness clear-felled industrial farmland.
"You forgot ""cooker"" as part of your description of the naysayers, but otherwise spot-on. Take my upvote."
"I can see that you're in NSW, so you should look into the draft benefit sharing guideline - basically the developer has to pay 1.5% of the project's cost (or $ per MW) to local communities, usually through Council or some other formed community body. It usually ends up being millions of dollars for community infrastructure and programs. If you live pretty close to a turbine (like within 3-5km), you may be able to get an annual monetary payment if they're going to affect you."
This is exactly what I was looking for thanks mate! I’ll do some research.
"Where you able to squeeze any perks out of the company for the town? They need accommodation for their workers which has pushed up housing prices meaning my house has doubled in value in three years, so there's that"
You might want to contact a not-for-profit called the Community Power Agency as they’ve done some work and advocacy for regional benefit sharing: https://cpagency.org.au Good luck!
"We planted thousands of fruit trees and natives for locals to ""block out"" the turbines so you're happy with that, we landscaped whole back yards for free"
highly recommend you go for things that are needed by all of the community eg: funding for disaster prep could be as simple as a scanner at the library and assistance for those who need it to digitize documents and get them into digital/online storage. money into bushfire prep electrification of community resources eg getting solar on the roof of a town hall and switch to electric ovens etc if you’re using gas. community electric share car/ute/truck
"I'd say perks wouldn't be on offer unless it directly ran through someone's land or they had to deal with noise from one.  I'm generally all for renewables, but I'd have concerns about native bird life - if that impact is either a truth or fiction. "
"MIT came to the conclusion that there was no material impact on bird life in comparison to many other major causes (such as predators, land clearing etc.). That coupled with a growing pressure on these companies to complete open environmental impact assessments it seems like something that is reasonably in control. The Australian Government completed a study for offshore wind and found no conclusive evidence that they impacted migrating bird populations however noted that more data was necessary. Their study also referenced some EU reports that had similar findings that yes, random deaths will occur but not more than what was considered incidental. The one thing most of the studies agree on is that the placement of turbines is key and that we should not be just looking to pop them on every hill top. As long as they are placed in known areas that avoid typical migration paths or nesting grounds then they are fine."
Do you have the same concerns about the impact coal mines & power stations have on native bird life as well? We need power generation - if you feel the impact of a wind farm is too high then what are you proposing that will have a lower impact?
You should find out if it's a truth or fiction then I guess.
