"Last year, the Australian government allowed $11.6 billion in subsidies for fossil fuels - more than 50 times the yearly budget of the National Recovery and Resilience Agency"

"Australia is the second largest exporting country for Coal in the world.
And Australia will be amongst the most vulnerable countries in the world for Climate Change impacts."
Climate refugees will seek refuge here as well most likely. It‚Äôs really disheartening to see how there‚Äôs so much talk around climate change but no one is pointing to the failures of liberal democracy.
"That was last year, at least we know the Albanese government stopped these subsidies in the mini budget they did when they came to power."
"I mean, they gave the get go for another coal project."
"Because TL;DR, there were two Australian governments last year, so was it the former, the current, or a combination of both who were responsible?"
How about: It doesn't matter and their interests are the same.
Fuck the media in this country works better when Labor is in power
Funny that the media seem strangely less assiduous in running 'interference' for them lol
"The fossil fuel excise rebate should not be applied to mining. The rebate should no longer exist at all, when they severed the requirement for the excise to be spent on roads they should have removed the rebate. All it does now is encourage the use of fossil fuels. The excise is used to fund government services. Taxes are pooled, there is nothing that enforces the excise to be used on roads. People arguing it does not count as a subsidy are disingenuous."
So NOW the herald sun see's fit to attack the government on climate change policy. For the last 10 years it was the daily antics of daggy dad and the gang handing out lumps of coal and it takes a labour government for the HS to find its green credentials.
6th extinction still running on time to wipe us out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Not enough money for Medicare reform though sorry everyone we need to give billionaires more they're running out
"11.4b of this was fuel tax excise refund, crazy how many people don't understand how the tax system works"
"We need to sieze the assets of any and all politicians who have taken lobbying contributions from these companies, and put it towards flood and fire home loss recovery. Opportunistic Narcissists and Psychopaths can't keep getting away with it."
"Whilst I understand our economy is totally tied up with these companies, any subsidies need to wind down or at minimum come with growing red tape ie. require a percentage for investment into renewables. Show us the pathway for this rort to end. I have every faith Albo will start to turn the ship. It‚Äôll take time thanks to Howard, Abbott, Morrison, et. al."
"Imagine a few billion going into renewable R&D. But nope. That Cole holding moment in parliament some years ago was basically a ""for sale"" sign. Target market = coal industry."
This probably counts fuel excise which is refunded due to the vehicles using the fuel are not driving on public roads. That‚Äôs not a subsidy that‚Äôs just complicated tax code which is made complicated for a good reason.
"Sensational piece that doesn't make it clear that the vast majority of that $11.6B is from the Federal Fuel Tax Credit Scheme. From the Australia Institute source linked in the article... The largest subsidy is the federal Fuel Tax Credits Scheme, at $8.07 billion, which exceeds the $7.5 billion spent on the Australian Army. And what is the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme? From here... Fuel tax credits provide businesses with a credit for the fuel tax (excise or customs duty) that's included in the price of fuel used in: machinery plant equipment heavy vehicles light vehicles travelling off public roads or on private roads. That's because the intended purpose of the fuel tax is to help fund road infrastructure. But if you instead use fuel to run a generator or drive vehicles on private property, well that's not using public roads and infrastructure, not causing any damage to public infrastructure, and therefore the tax component of fuel costs can be reimbursed. Renewable energy firms can also take advantage of that Fuel Tax Credit Scheme, in fact every single business can."
This counts the fuel excise rebate to businesses and farmers‚Ä¶which is disingenuous.
"Yep. They always do this and pretend like we‚Äôre all spending tons of money to support those industries, when in fact they contribute revenue to the government. If you get rid of them, we will have less revenue, not more available budget, we aren‚Äôt actually spending any money on them, we just don‚Äôt require producers and transporters to pay the fuel tax. If they don‚Äôt exist they still won‚Äôt pay the fuel tax, but you also won‚Äôt get revenue from them. I‚Äôm all for an open debate, but don‚Äôt be disingenuous."
Thats the point of these click bait articles.
We need to stop thos subsidies. Now. Really.
what are the subsidies?
"The biggest one is the fuel tax credit, what don't you like about that one?"
"This article sums up everything I despise about climate activism. There are not $11bn of subsidies for fossil fuel companies - $8bn of this number reflects mining and agricultural businesses that don‚Äôt pay road tax on diesel purchases, because they don‚Äôt use public roads. Making these companies pay road tax for roads they don‚Äôt use will do nothing for climate change, but could very easily send marginal businesses to the wall. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs an option for these businesses to switch to EV haulage run on renewables anyway. The way to increase renewable penetration is to increase supply of competitively priced renewable power, not add stupid taxes that achieve nothing."
If your mine is marginal after one of the biggest booms the country has ever seen your business is fucked and shouldn't exist.
"Making these companies pay road tax for roads they don‚Äôt use will do nothing for climate change Unless that money is flagged for green energy projects. Then it very much does. $8bn of this number reflects mining and agricultural businesses that don‚Äôt pay road tax on diesel purchases, because they don‚Äôt use public roads. But half the fuel excise tax collected is used for other purposes, not the maintenance of the road network. Since the rest of Australia contributes to the general economy with this tax AS WELL AS the maintenance of public roads, your argument is bullshit."
This is what needs to stop - you want coal? Great - don‚Äôt expect subsidies for things that are just destroying the place.
These are not subsidies but this is bad reporting
"what‚Äôs the source on the $11.6B of subsidies? until Angus allocated $300M to two refineries to not shut up shop, they got no direct subsidies one recently got some funding for fast chargers petroleum companies pay fuel taxes of about $20B per year (but the Feds hand back about $10B to business customers) it‚Äôs likely the $11.6B is modelling on the costs of climate change and their contribution, which is indirect subsidies and has a whole heap of subjectivity as to what indirect costs should or shouldn‚Äôt be included"
"what‚Äôs the source on the $11.6B of subsidies? It's from the Australia Institute research here: https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/australian-fossil-fuel-subsidies-surge-to-11-6-billion-in-2021-22/ Here is the actual study which reveals that $8.07 billion of that is the fuel excise tax rebate: https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/P1198-Fossil-fuel-subsidies-2022-WEB.pdf Fuel excise is an extra tax, on top of GST that is uniquely applied to fuel. It raises billions for the economy, and it isn't imposed on any other commodity. Fossil fuels contribute more to govt coffers than any other commodity. On top of coal royalties, and GST at the pump, You get the excise tax back if you don't use roads, i.e. diesel for your fishing trawler, or farm harvester, or mining truck. You don't get the GST back, and If you drive on roads then you don't get the excise back either. Where is this lost money going to come from if not an excise tax on renewables? You don't get that tax on renewables. If giving back excise to people who don't use roads is a subsidy, then not charging excise at all, even if you drive your electric car on roads must also be a form of subsidy that's even greater. When we transition totally, there'll be no more $billions in excise, or royalties so there will be a big shortfall that will have to come from somewhere if we want government services maintained."
"Last time a story like this was posted it included fuel excise rebates, a dry dock in Darwin, and a bunch of other infrastructure projects that were somehow ""subsidising"" fossil fuels."
"Pssst MR (in) sane. Climate scientists aren‚Äôt suggesting that climate change was prevented that fires, floods and the like would just stop. What their are actually saying is climate change are making these events more frequent and more intense. (Which is bad) Just thought you should know this key difference."
