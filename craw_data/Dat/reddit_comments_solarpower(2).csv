Australia proposing 'sun tax' where solar owners will pay to have their energy sent back to the grid
"As the title. Solar owners here in Australia may need to pay energy retailers to have their excess electricity sent back to the grid.

It's not our fault that the infrastructure wasn't ready to accommodate the growth in solar.

Homeowners invest thousands of dollars for a solar system to reduce their electricity bills yet they still find a way to make money off you. We even have a electricity bill relief from the government to help with the cost of living, but that will mean flip all when we end up paying back the amount back to the energy retailers.

Surely no other countries have this so called sun tax?"

The infrastructure is fine. The reality is that there's so much solar input during the day that there isn't enough demand on the grid to actually use it. Get a battery and load shift your solar.
"Why not make electricity really cheap during peak solar times, to encourage people to run their pool filter or washing machine at that time."
"That's nonsense. If you're penalized for sending energy back to the grid, use your excess energy to do whatever you want. It's still green energy even if you don't need all that you gathered. I suspect the best thing to do is store it. If all of your storage is full and all else fails turn all your lights on. lol"
Not a problem. Off grid it is.
"Unfortunately we have the same in the Netherlands. We pay a surcharge per kWh we send back to the itility. Complete nonsense, they are changing the rules while the game is played. I’m lucky i still have 3 years left on the old contract model which doesnt include the uplift."
Surely no other countries have this so called sun tax? [California has entered the chat]
"Work around, do not connect to the grid at all, connect appliances to 4kv-10kv inverter directly. Whatever uses the most electricity , use your solar cells to cover. This guy's system on YouTube is really good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w8mt5jOFpo Good luck to ya."
Batteries will become cheap fast once Sodium battery production has ramped up.
This is not an issue. The inverters will become smart and start dumping the electricity to ground Australia is quite advanced. Many EV chargers there charge the car only when electricity prices are zero. This won't last for too long.
"No need to even dump to ground. As I understand it, solar panels shouldn't have an issue with an open circuit. Unlike wind turbines, which either need to turn away from the wind or dump to a dummy load (like a Resistance water heater) or risk spinning too fast with no load. Inverters will just go open circuit instead of feeding the grid."
"You don't dump panel electricity to ground, you simply open the circuit. Or you divert the current to storage."
Got a source that isn’t a YouTube link?
"the article from the people that made that video https://yourenergyanswers.com/the-great-solar-stitch-up-solar-tax/ Found the news piece from 2 days ago https://9now.nine.com.au/a-current-affair/sun-tax-set-to-charge-solar-panel-owners-who-send-excess-electricity-back-to-the-grid-at-peak-times/8bb2e8e6-feb8-4620-b1aa-806539e252de#:~:text=The%20'sun%20tax'%20will%20soon,times%2C%20typically%20during%20the%20day.&text=%EF%BB%BFThe%20tax%20was%20developed,at%20times%20of%20high%20demand."
"Well, if that idiocy is implemented, I hope a lot of Aussies have inverters that can be set to a ""Zero Export"" mode. It isn't even entirely the fault of lousy infrastructure on the part of the utilities. Think back a few years to when they started to demand less use of incandescent bulbs. Everyone switched to CFL's and then to LED's, as a result, our meters were turning slower. The power companies weren't making money QUITE as fast as they were, so they raised rates. Now, more and more people have solar supplying part, or all, of their power. The power companies are seeing their profit margins shrinking again so this is how they, in Australia at least, are working to keep their profits up and their shareholders happy."
"Setup 10 EV s charging stations on your driveway and go pick up their evs and charge people to charge their EVs during the day and drop off the car before they finish work, problem solved ;)"
They did the same in Spain and destroyed the industry 10 years ago.
"Time for you all to upgrade to systems with batteries. Also to only offset, not export, electric services."
Glad we got a modular battery system … Gunna watch this with much interest.
most systems can be configured to zero export. Easy solution.
Another example of government employees paying themselves for— instead of solving—the problem
Let me see if I got this right - there’s an engineering problem and their solution is a tax?
The mantra of California politics
"Isn’t California dealing with a similar issue? When .05% of your customers have solar and 1:1 net meters, their usage is a rounding error. When 50% of your customers have very little daytime draw, draw good sized loads at night and winter and their bills are pennies, it becomes a big problem. They didn’t set up the rate structures to infinitely scale."
Mine some crypto during those times. Better than free power since you’re penalized for not using it.
"The wording of this thing is stupid. The ""sun tax"" is basically just a reduction in the feed-in tariff as it has been reducing steadily over the past 5 years. It was 20c per kwh 5 -6 years ago when i started in solar. This ""sun tax"" is basically a 2c - 3c reduction, you still get a few cents for feeding in. Their wording has just created this massive outrage for no reason. Whoever coined the term is an idiot."
I run most appliances during the day so use all my own power as a rule. A battery would be nice for the excess production but currently cost way too much. There's talk of a subsidy which will probably increase the price by the value of the subsidy if I know my history.
It's not at all about the environment. Just fucking money...
"Spain supposedly used to, but I've been told it was dropped in the last few years"
Really par for the course for Australia to nickel and dime you every step of the way.
Fuck them. I guess I’m getting batteries
"Different utilities are doing the same thing but calling it something else. In CA, the three private utilities are going to start charging a fixed charge that is for the use, maintenance, repair, payment of lawsuits. https://www.sce.com/customer-service/keeping-bills-manageable/fixed-charge"
"I'm waiting for battery prices to keep going down so I can just be completely not reliant on any energy company. I'll keep them as a backup if for some reason solar / battery / generator all fail. Off grid, and grid is backup is my plan."
Um im pretty sure id just disconnect my house from their grid… “SUN TAX”??? Ur going to tax me for using the sun wtf
Sounds like something Biden would come up with
Solar power was too weak to be useful until the day it was too strong to be useful.
"Australians need to claim back the public owned utilities. Water, power grid, residential communication lines are for the people and should be owned by the people."
What a joke.
"This is fucking mental. The more I learn about society in Australia, the less I like it as a country. Australia has a massive cultural problem with not giving a fuck about the environment."
That's not true... we give away billions of dollars worth of tax free natural gas to corporations worldwide so we don't use it and pollute Australia. XD
Add a carbon sequestering device. Efficiency or not it’ll now make your home healthier…
This nonsense happened in Spain. No
Talk about cutting one’s throat. Utilities make money selling that solar power at peak prices.
California does!!! And more
"Getting a battery is the only long-term answer. I have a 50KwH battery rack from Ruixu, very affordable, great for DC. Smaller options exist too, 20, 25, or 30 KwH racks. A general form of this same complaint pops up every day here: ""They're killing net-metering!"". Yep. Net-metering is quite amazing. You get to buy a product, use it, then return it for the exact same cost. Netting out to often zero cost, but sometimes a marginally small amount. I can't think of any other product where we get to require (often via regulations) that our supplier buy back from us, at full price, even after we've used it and gotten value from it. Net-Metering is awesome if you have it, but it can't continue to exist as more solar hits the grid. There is a tipping point. California has clearly passed it, and it sounds like Australia has too. I bought the big battery, it means I'll never have to care about Net-Metering."
"Hmm... Solar is potential energy. The panels don't produce anything unless there is a load on them. You pull energy from panels. It isn't pushed. ""Excess solar""? Maybe excess to the power companies that see less load demand on their generation facilities.."
"They do, red states (ones which have stronger fossil fuel/energy lobbying) in the US will sometimes charge transmission fees which can be higher than the value of the energy sent to the grid less than what they are collecting in taxes/fees."
Read up on CA’s war against solar.
I believe we need to rally against this in the streets. They are stealing from us all.
"Australia has alot of corruption in the form of big corporations lobbying the Government. People have no clue how many times the Australian people get bent over. Watch, most likely Australia will be the 1st country to have additional taxs on EVs based on the distance travelled per year."
"Removing tax breaks and increasing the costs to EV owners is all but certain as adoption grows. The income from taxing petrol is huge and forms a critical component in road infrastructure budgets. For every litre sold, just shy of fifty cents (49.6c) goes on tax. Something like $50billion a year in taxes are raised from selling petrol. That money has to come from somewhere if not from petrol."
This is ridiculous. YOu simply burn excess electricity boiling off water rather than paying to send it back to the grid. Air condition the out-of-doors. Mine Bitcoin Pump water uphill.
Has essentially happened in California - too much solar during some parts of the day causing negative energy prices and curtailment. Need to add batteries to the mix and to make the economics work again.
Has Donald Trump moved south of the equator? This is about the most psychotic aberration I have heard in a long time. Maybe just go to your inverter and turn it off one week before your scheduled read and then turn it back a week later. Sounds better than giving it to the greedy power companies that want to charge you for doing their job. Then neuter your parliament so they do not produce too many more carrot headed leeches.
People just dont take advantge of the ability to manage their solar and battery setups. Most people operate their appliances between 6am - 9am and 5pm -9pm without much thought.
"shouldn't they be paying us for the energy, i mean we pay them its only logical."
Can people just set their export limit to zero and not feed anything into the grid?
What the heck is wrong with this govt? A solar tax now? Do you own the Sun now??? Tomorrow wind tax and air tax depending how much you are breathing?? Why people keep taking it in silence is beyond me
"So I need to disconnect my panels during the day? Wtf.. I got solar to help with bills, not contribute to it"
This is merely a way for them to avoid paying you for the power you're feeding back. Greedy $##%%^
Taxstralia
"I get the fact that I'm no expert, but... If everyone is going to work and exporting their solar, then why can't they just spool down a few turbines and use exported solar to feed the many commercial and industrial places these people go to work? I figure my house is probably closer to my work than the local power station, so surely it can't be putting extra strain on lines. Also, as someone who only vaguely understands the magic of transformers and hv lines, does exporting somehow upset transformers as I assume it has to be upped to the 11kv or whatever they run down the lines? I doubt very much it's a problem with clouds and voltage drop as I assume satellite observation and some basic programming could predict and therefore compensate for that too. Any answers in layman's terms would be greatly appreciated. As it stands at the moment I cant afford batteries and am considering just switching them off whenever I can't use the panels as I sure as hell can't afford increased electricity rates. The panels were supposed to help me keep my head above water and pay the damn elec bill, and now it seems I just gained another debt to drown in trying to pay them off without the already tiny income my excess electricity used to net me."
"Are you , the hoppers, being forced to put energy into the grid?....No? Then its income.... and taxable. '"

Ahhh capitalism.

"But its not like they didn't see this problem coming right? We've been incentivised to go solar for a while now, yet they wait til they're no longer able to support it, then make solar owners wear the cost to upgrade the network."
"By profiting off the power we send back. We get 10c per kw, the retailer is probably selling it for 20c+. Made up numbers."
does australia not have basic connection fees?
"It’s not even that. They’re exporting, and everyone’s exporting, when demand is low and supply is high. You know that pushing electricity to a full grid will brown out, right?"
