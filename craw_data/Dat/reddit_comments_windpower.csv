Working with Wind turbines in Australia
Wondering if anyone has experience working on wind turbines in Australia ? What qualifications do you need and where to find the jobs? Anyone knows of any installation projects? With GWO qualification and experience in installation.
comment
Vestas was offering a pretty stout package to go out and work there
Do you know where and what qualifications they are looking for ?
"In Australia you could try the big OEMs, which are Vestas, GE, Nordex and Siemens. But they often subcontract the turbine installation to specialist WTG installation companies. Some companies to consider: Fairwind, Cosmic Group, ARC Wind Generally a GWO would be necessary, and maybe some other skills/qualifications."
Awesome this is very helpful thanks
"Search the group with the little magnifying glass for your question, then ask the question if it doesn't find it. Step one to being a wind tech, be resourceful, the only wrong question is the one that's been asked and answered 5 times already."
And quit saying the parks been running well
