Hydrogen Fuel System - Any good?
"These Hydrogen fuel systems look interesting! Anyone have any experience with them? Worth the money/hassle of installing?

Update: Thanks for the responses. I found this excellent scientific experiment explaining why these hydrogen fuel systems are bollox for anyone interested now or in the future: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zErilY7E-M"

"Yeah, not quite a scam, because the folks making em probably genuinely believe they work. They don't. It takes power to make the hydrogen, which comes from your vehicle. Unless you're generating the hydrogen at home and bringing it along in tanks. The laws of thermodynamics apply in this universe. If they actually worked, car manufacturers would be putting em in, and advertising that their car runs cheaper."
Hmm fair enough. Thanks for the info!
"Yeah it does look a bit ""how ya goin'"" for sure. I have seen these kind of units being sold on ebay many years ago, then saw an ad for them on Gumtree just now from a guy in WA that makes them. Just thought I'd put it out there for real world experiences. Cheers mate üôÇüëç"
FYI most hydrogen is made from reforming methane. Net result - same amount of CO2 as burning the methane directly but only 75% or so of the energy of burning the methane directly.
Pure snakeoil.
"These ""fuel cells"" will at best decrease your fuel economy (laws of physics say no free power), more likely do nothing. At worse be dangerous. Almost entirely they are scams. The worst part is they do play off actual hydrogen fuel cells for why they are good. But even then good luck ever trying to use them in most countries. My advice avoid at all costs.

"Thanks mate. Yeah that seems to be the general consensus. There's a mob in my local area that does engine ""carbon cleaning"" which uses hydrogen to apparently clean the internals of your engine, particularly your intake system. Is it fair to suspect that is a scam too? I've always wondered... Though I have noticed a performance increase after having a carbon clean service so it does make me curious."
Whaaaat? Brockie's energy polariser was totes based on science! Surely this is better.
