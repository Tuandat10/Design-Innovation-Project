The debate around nuclear power in Australia isn't just political. There's also a generational divide

comment
"I think Australia is mostly passed the days of ""nuclear"" being a scary boogieman word. Rather, opposition to nuclear energy (and/or the AUKUS nuclear submarines) is primarily based on practicality and cost. It just doesn't make sense when renewables are dramatically cheaper even including transmission and grid storage. Maybe it's worth revisiting the debate if SMR ever deliver on the promise. We have plenty of time. It's not like cost-effective SMR are suddenly going to appear on the market overnight. Note: this on the basis that nuclear proponents are debating in good faith; which definitely doesn't apply to Dutton et al."

"There's certainly an intelligence divide between economists, scientists and the press (propaganda) arm of the fossil fuel lobbyists masquerading as politicians."

"There is no ‚Äúdebate‚Äù. Its an entirely made up tactic by the Libs to spike any investment and development of renewables, to support their lobbying masters. The media is entirely complicit in this circus. Not a single credible thinker, scientist or economist thinks nuclear power in Australia is affordable, viable or even worthwhile. Hydrogen storage is many times more feasible."
"The media is entirely complicit in this circus. Even the ABC getting sucked in a bit here. From the article: In its GenCost report, the CSIRO estimated the capital costs of an SMR would top $31,000 per kilowatt, compared with $3,040/kW for wind and $1,525/kW for large-scale solar. However, those figures are contested. A peer-reviewed 2020 study by the University of Queensland estimated the cost would be between $4,700/kW and $9,900/kW. The report says the capital costs would be recovered over the lifetime of the project. Because SMRs only exist on paper, that 2020 study is in large part based on what the NuScale project in Idaho, USA was expected to cost. The problem is that GenCost's numbers are influenced by what NuScale actually cost, when the project blew out so far that it was no longer able to secure enough private funding (despite a heaping of public funding) and collapsed last November. Instead of applying any basic critical analysis of the sources, the pro-nuclear claim is presented at face value."
"Agree, what the heck‚Äôs happened to the ABC as a credible media source‚Ä¶ I understand commercial owned spinning ‚Äútruth‚Äù to whatever is in their owners interests, but the ABC is publicly funded‚Ä¶ Who the hell is deciding this primarily corporate editorial stance"
There's no debate. The answer is no.
"I've been a big supporter of nuclear power but I think Australia is decades late to be getting into it now. It's too expensive, and too long to get going, all the while greener alternatives are rapidly getting cheaper and faster to implement. Should have done it in the 80s."

"Yeah the latest ""rebuttal"" of the nuclear sock puppets is to call anyone critical of nuclear expansionism a ""boomer"". What's implied here is that somehow GenZ are all about cool, sexy, sciencey nuclear and only ""the olds"" are against it. This is of course a complete fantasy and yet another distraction. The reason no one in their right mind is interested in nuclear is the economics are horrendous. New nuclear produces power 300-500% more expensive than renewables. The nuclear power plant recently completely in Finland had to be turned off for long periods as it was running at a loss (ie. couldn't compete on price vs renewables). France with their massive fleet of aging nuclear reactors was a net importer of power from Spain, Germany and the UK for two years running. Even when their reactors are running, they have to sell at a loss or scale down production as they can't compete with renewables. That's why no private capital is going anywhere near it and is pouring into renewables instead. Also, any new nuclear we started now would be 10-15 years minimum to complete. Not only is this too late to make any difference to climate change, but the build phase spanning decades is incredibly carbon intensive and you have to run the nuclear plant for 40+ years to claw that carbon back. On top of this decommisioning and disposal are ""unsolved"" problems and both promise to be very carbon intense. Overall it's a hard no from absolutely everyone I'm afraid."
"Labor could kill this dead by calling the Libs‚Äô bluff and removing the ban. If the numbers don‚Äôt stack up then no one is going to come forward with any proposals. Without any firm support from the private sector, the whole thing would fade away."
It's kind of ironic that the LNP are trying to appeal to their mostly older voters on nuclear power when it's that same post-war generation that protested against anything nuclear through the 60s and 70s.
"What isn't there a generational divide about, I wonder?"
Nuclear was an option 20 years ago. The cost a way to much compared to solar and wind plus batteries. Which are way quicker to construct and less regulatory head aches. I don't think we can wait 10+ years to get a plant built that's way more expensive per kWh to solar or wind. In saying this aren't we getting nuclear sub some time this century? So we do need the skill set. Not sure if it's worth the extra dollars for the power.
"Is there a lack of people with knowledge of how to handle and maintain nuclear reactors? I heard/read this somewhere, I can't remember, and I don't know if its speculation or fact."
Let's have an urgent debate on whether we should legalise fusion power!!!
"Looking into it superficially, I'd give better than even odds of fusion is commercially viable before SMR."
"Great, do you want the LNP to ban the sun?"
"As they say, follow the money. Why would we want to invest in as yet unproven nuclear power technology (SMRs), with all the associated risks, costs and waste disposal issues; when we have copious amounts of free sun and wind for which the technology is already proven? The economic argument doesn‚Äôt stack up. However when you look who stands to benefit, Gina Rinehart is one of those calling for nuclear power? Wouldn‚Äôt that just be grand for Hancock Prospecting? I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs the only one who will benefit, she was an easy one to Google especially with the known links between her and the Liberals."
"A question for people who have done more reading on this subject than me. Are the cost based assessments inclusive of transmission upgrades required to get the power from regional renewable sites vs. nuclear, which I assume could be built in the same place as current or former coal power stations. And the costs of land space required for renewables and waste storage requirements of nuclear ? Please, I have no interest I some agenda driven debate on this. I am really just interested in the numbers"
"There is no debate, fuckos üòÇ"
It kind of feels like the author just wanted to turn it into an aboriginal issue. ABC should not be leading articles with opinions from Jane uneducated about nuclear submarines. It is just giving a platform to ignorant and uneducated people.

Any power station is a target in an all out war. Nuke plants aren't any more special.
