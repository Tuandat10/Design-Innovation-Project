Why does the government need to spend so many billions funding and supporting renewable energy if it is so cheap and economically viable? Why wouldn't the market be chomping at the bit to invest themselves?

Wait until you hear what the government is spending on fossil fuels
"Have you honestly looked at the numbers? 80% of the ""subsidy"" is the fuel tax concession which is a load of shit as a subsidy, it's a road user charge that they get back for not using roads. Another 5% of the ""subsidy"" is the cost of running government departments that regulate the mines and providers. That leaves about 15% which a large part is government investing in firming capacity like gas speakers to support renewables, or extension of a coal plant until renewables come online. Happy to be corrected, but I can't find anything significant for fossil fuels subsidisation."
Because the overhead costs of getting started is expensive. Just like setting up coal was when that technology was emerging.
"The market is 'chomping at the bit' https://www.iea.org/reports/scaling-up-private-finance-for-clean-energy-in-emerging-and-developing-economies/key-findings Government subsidies on fossil fuels is what you should be angry about, dwarfs renewable subsidies https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/57-1b-record-breaking-fossil-fuel-subsides-following-climate-election/"
"We subsidize Fossil fuels to the tune of 12 Billion dollars. I bet you're fuming about that too. Funding renewables is for a few reasons. Mainly so it gets done faster, the infrastructure is in place, and we produce it here instead of one overseas country."
"The short answer is that it would be hard to get the scale required in the timeframes desired if you just left it up to investors.
The govt. are trying to speed up the process, and incentives are the ""go-to"" in these situations. Is it a good use of tax payers money? Time will tell..."
"Because if our government doesn't support them, the investors will build renewables in other countries. Australia is expensive and hard to work in, the gov subsidies ease that pain a bit."
"A number of commenters have already posted information showing that ""the market"" is chomping at the bit for Cheap renewable energy production. Part of it is that ""the Market"" wants a handout from the government to undercut the costs, even if those costs are less than further investment in fossil fuel or Nuclear energy they still want to reduce costs. Another reason is the government wants to further stimulate renewable adoption to get it done faster and at greater scale than companies might otherwise be willing to do on their own. We are on a bit of a time limit.
Despite what we are often told, the market can be slow to change and adopt new ways of doing things, anyone who's worked for a sizeable company before would of experienced this. Short-term thinking, stagnant strategy, risk aversion etc.
The Government subsidising the cost stimulates the adoption of renewable energy. Energy security is important. It's critical to the economy, national security and other aspects as well.
The government has a vested interest in directing the Energy generation sector."
"Wow, ever looked at how much oil and gas get ?"
Do you also wonder how many billions just one nuclear plant will be subsidised? I do.
*champing
Scrolled way too far to find this.
Same with nuclear!
The post is about renewables. It sounds like you're just trying to dodge.
Repeat after me üåàINFRASTRUCTUREüåà
There has just been a massive wind farm announced in WA that‚Äôs private
"Public finance is generally going into enablers like transmission and distribution infrastructure which (because the grid is a natural monopoly) tend to be publicly owned. Private finance is going into generation assets which are the competitive part of the system and are generally privately owned (these days; with exceptions). Dutton wants to go back to the 1950s and put the whole cost and entire risk of nuclear generating assets onto the public accounts. This is needless, fiscally irresponsible, and foolish. His successor, the PM of 2040, will also have to break the energy market to force nuclear generation onto the grid, when there are rival generators able to sell at a fraction of the cost. So much for the party of liberal ideas and free markets."
Because its a WEF backed topic. Tax payers are paying huge amounts for the power transmission costs alone. So that their corporate mates can install renewables in cheap areas and use that Infrastructure.
"It is cheap and easy and better for the environment. BUT it takes the money out of the boomer coal lords who in return fund mass amounts of disinformation which seems like you have fallen for. A renewable energy source is better for the environment, you have thousands of new businesses/job opportunities and help our country be more independent. But people get hung up on the fact that it will cost a couple billion to get started despite the fact we spend hundreds of billions on dirty coal"
"The market are chomping at the bit to invest in it themselves though. o_O The extent to which government spurs this on is because we face an existential threat (i.e. climate change). The market is stepping in, but it's always worth considering any help we can give it, given that climate change is a threat to human civilisation."
"If soft would just look up how the CIS works he would answer his questions himself pretty well, but im guessing he gets his ideas from sky, so not much chance of him doing that. Anyway the CIS 'renewable subsidy' that they blab on about is underwriting of costs and profits from the gov. A project in the scheme gets a rebate if their return is below a certain level, and has to pay if their return is above a level. And before everyone jumps in with 'we're subsidizing them to make a loss' remember there's a cap on the wholesale price currently where the gov covers the diffrence for fossil fuel generators to protect consumers from crazy high coal and gas prices."

That just proves my point.
I'm not sure if you're a bot or paid poster looking at your history
Because we want to be world leaders in this teach and you need to invest to profit. It's what we should have been doing decades ago.
"We‚Äôre still subsidising fossil fuels. And now the Liberals want to subsidise nuclear. And investment in renewables is going through the roof. Subsidies for industry are not necessarily a bad thing. They can help emerging technologies, and in particular where it‚Äôs not economically viable in the short term. There are other reasons for subsidies for renewables too - the costs of not lowering carbon emissions are enormous."
We‚Äôre still subsidising fossil fuels. And now the Liberals want to subsidise nuclear This completely proves my point.
They got to look like they doing something at least just as the subsidised gas and coal 16 billion last year who paid less tax than an average middle class worker
A massive private wind farm has just been announced 50km from collie in WA today which makes the proposed nuclear site in collie possibly unviable ‚Ä¶
"Government spending sets the tone and direction of the economy. Billions are spent on energy every year because it's an economic driver and multiplier. No country's energy system is free of government oversight and spending. This government and many businesses and many citizens, recognise the benefits of lowering carbon outputs now. Those same people can see a degree of energy independence available to ordinary Australians and businesses that is the antithesis of nuclear power. Solar on the roof, a battery out the back and a cheap Chinese ev will see many Australian homes energy independent. Maybe a question to ask is what happens if all government funding in the energy sector is removed?"
"The answer is actually super basic, for all energy and quite a few industries, including film and tech. They aren‚Äôt straight up cash - they are incentives. Build your renewables in Australia and employ local and supply local (some) and you will receive government grants, tax credits and offsets. They aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfunding and supporting renewable energy‚Äù. They are attracting business investment and economic activity. The market follows the dollars. The market is short sighted as hell which is why governments do these programmes to de-risk. A lot can be said of the value to this - but you asked for the why."
For the same reason they spend so many billions subsidising coal and gas power.
So renewables are unviable then? Why are they flat out lying?
The market kind of is chomping at the bit. 30% of Australian households have solar panels. That means 30% of Australians looked at the costs vs the benefits themselves and were willing to spend their own post tax dollars trying to save on their energy bills. How many people do you think would chip in for a coal power station unforced? Or a nuclear power station? That level of free market investment into energy at the retail level is simply unprecedented. You don't have to be a dyed in the wool Greenie to see that renewable energy is going to be a huge part if not the majority of the energy infrastructure going into the future. The question is really just what other types of energy are going to be needed to supplement and how to best navigate the transition. The only people arguing that renewable energy isn't worth it anymore are mouth breathers and paid shills.
Because it‚Äôs not economically viable and consumer will need to pay via bills or government
Legalized laundering of tax payers money
"They are? The government needs to spend a lot of money on the connecting infrastructure, which private investors don't make money from so they don't invest in it"
on a side note the lack of basic english comprehension shown by many in this thread is doing my head in.
"Because it's more expensive and less profitable than the fossil fuels we currently have. That's what the market wants to keep investing in. The problem being of course it's only so right now, not later when we're dealing with all the fallout from climate issues, but they don't care about that because it doesn't affect them."
Because why would large multinational corporation choose to do it here when they can make the same amount of money elsewhere or at home for less effort and lower startup costs? We're not exactly in walking distance to the rest of the world.
If it is so much more profitable to build it in other countries rather than Australia then it is not viable in Australia basically by definition. 
"The problem I‚Äôve always seen is that any subsidy that‚Äôs been placed on renewables has stifled development/innovation. Why try to compete if someone gives you no incentive to improve and thus you stay stagnant. Solar panels don‚Äôt seem to be any cheaper , last longer or be more efficient than they were a few years ago. Double that for batteries at retail level and no wonder customer‚Äôs up take for renewables isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd think."
"If the example set by profiting from war (a victory stops the money train - eternal war is the goal) then we can correctly assume that energy too, is only profitable when it is inefficient and always in dire need of upgrades. Its funny how energy companies seem to be unable to meet the demand we apparently have for electricity and while we switched to power saving LED, we need to also build more power plants ?"
The problem is that there‚Äôs no consensus in energy policy so everyone is worried that if they invest in Renewables the next government will rewrite the rules shut them down.
Because without the subsidies they aren't viable.
‚ÄúWhy would I invest my own money when the government will give me money to do it instead?‚Äù I think that‚Äôs it in a nutshell.
"It's a money-making rort, it always has been. Renewable energy on a larger scale has never been cheaper. Not enough is produced to compensate for the amount lost in transmission, never mind the capex costs It works well on a small scale with no transmission distance, IE solar roof panels on a house As for all the EVs you see on Sydney, they're all powered by the coal fired power station south of Newcastle"
"Sure, let‚Äôs privatise the new energy resource.. It‚Äôs much better off in government hands."
Privatise it because it's better in government hands? How does that make sense?

Not how what works?
"The free market can't solve everything. The original power stations and network were govt funded and owned. Infrastructure has generally been a govt venture in the past due to the risk and massive costs. And to ensure a basic level of service to the population and prevent price hikes and blackmail on an essential service. Right now we have a threat to our way of life due to climate change and the changing every market. There's poles and wires to build to connect our vast country together ( connect populations with renewables ). Big renewables projects can be seen as too risky to venture capital unless there are guarantees. This applies to others too like nuclear. Hinkley Point C station being built in the UK went ahead with a deal for French nuclear contractor EDF but only because the UK govt guaranteed high prices (2-3 times as much as Australian electricity) for 30 years. Leaving the job to the market would result in no renewables, no nuclear, no power. Even if the govt does support renewables, they're doing it to ensure energy security and it hopefully means low power prices in the long run."
Why did the LNP Government spend Billions funding and supporting Coal? Why does the LNP want taxpayers to spend Billions fund and support Nuclear Power?
Because coal generation is economically unviable. Coal stations are running at a loss. Origin and AGL want to close their coal stations but the government won't let them. They need to be propped up. Do you honestly believe they would want to shut them down if they were making money? Yet somehow renewables need government money because...reasons?
"Great question , and one the renewable zealots wont answer. The private sector wont invest coz so many of the schemes go bust or are just way too expensive with out billions from governments."
"Interesting, if they back their councils, why are they forcing councils now to manage the state fire ant outbreak? Costing ratepayers in those areas millions of dollars for a state responsibility. A regional city councillor said his organisation was blindsided by a state government decision to cost-shift fire ant treatments to make them responsible for costs after June 30, 2024. This follows a recent communication from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to local governments which confirmed as of July 1, 2024, councils would be responsible for undertaking increased surveillance and suppression activities of red imported fire ants. Seems to me labor are full of shit and funnily enough labor did not do a media release on that so it could be posted here by the usual people."
"Because we live in a society of consumerism and thats where the money is to keep expensing ongoing costs. Renewable energy systems have costs in every aspect of the product lifecycle. The mining and extracting costs are extremely high to attain the rare earth metals and processing of various materials into shape. Then the entire system needs to replaced every 25 years or so as they can't operate any longer due to excessive wear and tear of all the materials and components. Then to dispose, are broken apart and dumped in farmers backyards for a cost. All this to produce energy thats ~15-40% available compared to coal and gas being 100% reliably available. Because it's only 15-40% available we need to store the energy in batteries. Another technology thats wildly inefficient at large scales and need extra cooling so they don't explode. More expenses. One of our oldest running coal-fired power plants was commissioned in 1976, Gladstone QLD, commissioned to close in 2035, so it's scheduled to run for 59 years.. The only people pushing the expensive renewables are the corporations to make money of it. The illusion that it's cheaper is becauze its subsidized. The government also pushes it because for every parliamentarian, there are 10 lobbyists. Then the revolving doors to further keep politicians happy. Our energy needs need to be 100% reliably available. The next closest competitor for energy production to coal-fired is Nuclear. Take a look at this comparison with Nuclear energy in terms of land usage, power production, availability and ongoing costs. Sustainable Development Comparison - NEI.org The ongoing costs of renewable energy keeps the corporates expensing the tax payers. Therefore a continous flow of money from the government and from citizens to keep them running. They go bankrupt if they're not subsidized enough. Another Swedish wind farm faces PPA-driven bankruptcy Look at what happened to Finland when they got their reactor running, 70% decrease in energy prices immediately. Finland Electricity Price Surge"
Because it doesn‚Äôt actually exist yet and someone needs to the RND.
Renewable energy doesn't exist...? Fairly sure some houses have solar panels on their roof.
"it's not cheap. If renewable are so great, why are Chinese and Indians building more coal generators? Especially China when they are the dominant producer.  Big tech in the us are demanding so much more electricity that they are investing and building their own nuclear reactors. People never take into account the unreliability of 'renewable' energy. We would need battery storage and also a backup reliable electricity source. We'll also need to fundamentally change the grid to a more decentralised system.  What the government need to do is to stop subsidising. Not to fossil fuels, not to renewable, not to universities and not to businesses."
This is just nonsense. Energy generation and academics are a public service. The government should absolutely be supporting that.
