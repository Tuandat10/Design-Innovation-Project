"I dont think green-hydrogen for energy-exports has legs, but the use to power industrial processes and fertilisers using overbuilt solar would be amazing."
Exporting it fertiliser (Ammonia) is certainly way more feasible than direct hydrogen export.
It's for trucks and supply a hydrogen transport hub.
Why is the roof not covered in solar panels? I'd have thought that would be easy pickings for a green hydrogen plant.
"There is a big, fuck-off solar farm a few km down the road. Different company, but they are also building a hydrogen plant. Twiggy would probably follow suit if there was the space available, but solar is probably not cost effective on a price/kwH basis where his facility is."

"More money gets spent every year on road ""upgrades"" that rip up our country and make traffic worse"
Pipe down boomer. You wonâ€™t get change without spending money.
