Labor’s Future Made In Australia policy wins over voters: Resolve Political Monitor survey

comment
"Iâ€™m all for supporting Australian business, but do they honestly think we can compete with a manufacturing behemoth that is china? Theyâ€™ve already overtaken the us in the development and production of electric cars, thereâ€™s no chance we can beat china in making solar panels. Designing more efficient panels, perhaps, but thatâ€™s where the competition should end."
People are so easily fooled - Labor;s policies are driving what little manufacturing we have left into oblivion...............or to Indonesia.
"We need manufacturing for one simple reason, you can't shove everyone into the services industry and have a happy population."
Made in Australia policy but support nobody except foreign migrants . Piss off.
Made in Australia! (by immigrants)
"It's got Albos hands all over it, it'll be a fuck up for sure"
"If people don't think that Dutton's nuclear plan will involve massive investments in the nuclear industry they are having a laugh. I'd rather invest in renewables. I'd rather invest in emerging high technological industries that make sense to be made in Australia. High tech pharmaceuticals are a good example. We research and develop drugs, but then export the manufacturing of them. For high tech drugs this can be a problem - as it was with the covid vaccine."
"Ah yes, but not even in OUR nuclear industry. I watch nascar racing sometimes and itâ€™s full of ads for American jobs building those subs WE paid for. Just fantastic."
"I love threads like this here, folk who 'love Australia' and plastic flags in Woolies, Pauline Hanson speaks for us etc. etc. grasping at straws trying to find reasons why Australia shouldn't manufacture even though they e been saying for years we should make everything here. Almost as good as the threads.about the stage 3 tax cuts adjustments that benefits them."
"Taking money from productive industries/people via the higher levels of taxation needed to subsidise unproductive industries which cannot exist without said subsidies is bad policy. Unless you believe in voodoo multipliers, as Professor Robert Barro called it, government subsidies are inherently inefficient and cannot result in an economic impact equal to or greater than that money would have otherwise had."
"Pathetic protectionism that will get gobbled up by Labors big donors. Just like the millions he handed out to Tritium, just for them to close up shop. Insolvencies at an all time high and Labor's energy folly will push more to the brink."
Wholesale energy prices are down almost exclusively due to labor governments pushing renewables. Retail prices are up because the energy retailers want more profit. Your comment shows you really don't know what the hell you're talking about mate.
"So pay more taxes, or divert taxes from something else to prop up Aussie-made stuff, like Europe does with farm subsidies making it harder for us. Why not just bring back tariffs if you believe in unfair competition. People can pay more for product whether they like it or not, and the government will make more money instead of spending it. Or just label the solar panels Australian Made and let people decide themselves if they want to pay more for them. There's plenty of stuff we're good at without propping it up. Should have just kept propping up the motor industry if you wanted that. I'm still driving a Holden, but I wouldn't be if there was an extra tax to buy it over anything else. That was the problem. People weren't choosing it regardless of how much government support it got."
You wouldn't be driving a Holden without the government subsidising the company into existence.
As Julia Gillard said: 'We are transitioning into a service based economy'
You mean like NDIS?
I went to the website and it looks okay but it all comes down to the projects they're funding. I'm generally against subsidies without a good argument behind them. If it's things like manufacturing our own Green energy? Awesome. But if it's some random industry? No thanks.
"As a business owner, only 2 things matter. Cheap fuel / electricity, and low taxes. Handing out free money to the lucky few while everyones costs go sky high is why insolvencies are at an all time high."
"The plan does appear to be a focus on green energy, green metals and quantum technologies. With subsidies well executed in those fields it would give us a massive industrial and manufacturing advantage over nations that have been out competing us in manufacturing for a while, allowing an organically grown manufacturing sector to grow in the future."
"Labor's Future Made in Australia policy is good policy. Interestingly, I pitched a similar idea to the Liberal Party some time ago, that it could accept the reality of the energy transition rather than oppose it and look to commercialise it."
