"The Coalition cannot commit to Australiaís 2030 emissions reduction targets, with senior Nationals MPs conceding a plan to adopt nuclear power would mean a future Coalition government would walk away from the Paris Agreement"

"I'm shocked! Shocked, I tell you! Who could have possibly foreseen this???"
I think most of us figured out it was a stupid idea when the only person they could trick into supporting it was that kid who went on Q&A as an ‚Äúindependent public supporter‚Äù and then it turned out he had strong ties to the liberal party.
"That kid got a trip to a conference in Dubai out of it, and an interview with Tom Switzer on RN Background Briefing. Hate to be unkind to a high school student, but he's a useful idiot."
"Just dont vote for the Coalition ever, so they dont return to government. The 2030 deadline wont be a problem! Dutton , does not matter how long you delay the annoucement of the nucelar sites, its just another shit idea !"
Of course it is but he doesn‚Äôt care. He simply wants an alternative policy out there so he doesn‚Äôt look empty on the issue. Bonus points for pleasing the mining and gas industry by giving them a business as usual card till the details are worked out (never)
I foresee more teals in Parliament!
"Nuclear isn‚Äôt inherently bad, but they had almost a decade to start and only proposed it when labor got into power."
"Ahh the Nationals, a solid reason why the Liberals will not return to government for a very long time"
"Nuclear? Nah, if they get power they will not mention it again (maybe they will do a study which will say it‚Äôs unfeasible). It‚Äôs back to coals and gas to appease the likes of Gina and twiggy Forrest baby!"
Ted O'Brien is an absolute wanker. I listened to him speak at the Australian Nuclear Association conference last year and half his speech was basically us good Labor bad
Did anyone else think that picture of David Littleproud (who's just had to pay back $3k in travel expenses he naughtily claimed) was actually Bruce Lehrmann at first glance?
"The coalition doesn‚Äôt actually support nuclear power, they support talking about it for as long as possible without changing a thing."
Think California just recently ran 100% renewables for 30 days +. And because of Murdoch and lnp we are still squabbling about it it's real FFS
This mob have little to be proud about.
can't imagine they'd ever build it tho
Are these guys actually seriously politicians representing the will of the people or are they shills for the fossil fuel industry. Theft is a crime... How is such obvious corruption so easily overlooked?
More Australians support nuclear energy than are opposed.
Gina gets what Gina wants. Period.
Screw all politicians
Impossible! You mean having access to a vastly superior source of energy that is cleaner and safer than coal or solar...would mean we could leave the paris Climate Accord? Le fucking shock!!!
Whereas the ALP have committed to a target that we aren‚Äôt going to meet ‚Ä¶ is that any better?
At least the LNP are proposing a tool that could actually help.
"If they want to win government then must commit to a maximum 30 million population.
Unsign the Paris accord. Unwoke Australia. Have 4 referendums per year . Otherwise Australia will be finished."
"Maybe if Labor would do something for low and middle income Australians, like fixing Medicare and education, we wouldn't have have to worry about Coalition policies as they wouldn't win the next election. If Labor wants to fix the environment, fantastic. Maybe they should start adopting policies likely to keep them in power so they can make meaningful long term environmental policy."
"Maybe they should start adopting policies likely to keep them in power so they can make meaningful long term environmental policy. Labor: best I can do is approve the largest new fossil fuel project in the Southern hemisphere (Woodsides burrup hub). The LNP are terrible, but Labor don't give a shit about the environment either. Never will while they're in the pockets of fossil fuel companies."
All this debate is silly when ultimately including nuclear in the mix makes it easier to achieve net zero.
"""Net zero"". Can you explain it to me please?"
