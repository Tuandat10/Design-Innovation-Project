How much are you actually saving after installing solar?
"So our bills have sky-rocketed in the last two years - between working from home or my wife being home with our two year old - there is always someone using power.

Add in ducted air con use, heating in Canberra winter and using out heat pump dryer alot more... we are paying $5k a year in electricity!

I have $10k that I can spend... time to think about solar. Could possibly stretch to $17k.

How much are people actually saving? What did you install?"
comment
My electricity was around $250-450. After installing solar panels my first bill was down to $9. Installing it was around 5.5k. Totally worth it.
per quarter?
"About the same here, then installed 6.6kW system and first bill went negative (save money on the next bill). Total cost to install was about $4k. I estimated around a 5 year payback period which I was totally happy with"
"Thanks for confirming, a good saving."
"Our solar panels, of which we have 12 north facing panels, kept our quarterly power bill to under $50. We have since installed a 14kw ducted system that rarely goes off during these hotter months and I'm keen to see how much out bill jumps up."
If you are home during the day it is a no brainer.... Get it.
"When you get a quote for solar panels, they want to know your current electricity usage, and then part of the quote is a graph of before solar electricity cost each month vs after solar cost each month. If you haven't used it yet, there's the ACT sustainable household scheme where you can get up to $15k in a 10 year interest free loan. Maxed out is $57.70 fortnight repayment. To be eligible the average unimproved value of your property over the last 5 years must be less than 750k I'm in the process of getting solar installed and estimates for my situation are the system will pay for itself in 6 years."
"Salespeople wouldn't exaggerate though, right?! Yeah, I have considered the loan scheme also."
"WFH, toddler in the house. 6.6kwh system and my bill went from about $30 a week to <$10 a week when installed in January, so it's saving me about 70% at the moment. It is summer though, the panels will be less effective in winter.  Still worth it."
"I got a quote recently and based on our usage, it had a 12 year payback period which just doesn't seem worth it to be honest."
"You can save power by switching to peak/off peak charge and using most of your utilities during that off peak timezone. Every time I’ve done the calculations, Solar payback period has been around 5-6years."
Don't forget the sweet interest free loan the gov backs in Canberra. Up to 15k for 10 years.
"13kw of panels just installed on a 4br all electric house. Bills averaged $100/mth before solar, this month looks like it'll be a credit between $50 and $100. I went bigger on the panels to be able to charge two electric cars in the future (whenever that may be)."
"We installed solar a couple of years ago. We don't have a battery though, so it only really saves us mpney in sunny weather. Over Winter we get basically no savings (couple of hundred per quarter, I can't remember the exact number) Over summer we pay about $5 ... for the whole 3 months. My wife and I work from home too, and pretty much have the air-con going all day every day. I'd say it's saved us roughly 50% on our yearly electricity bill. If you had a battery it'd save more, but the battery itself is too expensive for us at the moment (I know it'd save money in the long run, but you have to be able to afford the upfront cost)."
Installed for $6k in March 2019 and they’ve paid themselves off already.
Have a look at the Solar Quotes website - it has a lot of useful information and educational material on solar power.
"I don't have an energy meter that can tell me what the household used vs exported easily. But even with the now massively reduced feed in tariffs, it still makes financial sense especially if you're home all day and running the AC. We generated 11.5MW of power in the last 12 months, that's only now good for about $650 at a 6c feed in rate, nothing to shake a stick at, but if you never used any of the power generated you're looking at 10-12 years to repay. So you really don't make the gains by selling it back anymore, you need to move your consumption to solar. If your WFH and run the AC you'll see a pretty decent cut. Make sure you do things like washing machine and dishwasher during the day as well and ideally if you can also move cooking you'll see even bigger gains. We're a house of 4, with ""high"" energy usage, WFH, ducted AC and an EV. The EV uses about 250kwh a month - or about $15 to charge from solar for a month! There are some other considerations too, like our hot water runs on another circuit at night so can't currently take advantage of solar, so a few more things to be done to improve our usage. Cooking and AC at night are still our main usages."
"Ours started in 2015 and simple cash back six and a bit years later. It cost $6700 for 4.2 kW and we saved around $1100 per year. I kept a detailed spreadsheet and learned a few lessons. You have to use $ per per-kW usage rate, not your average (e.g. $ paid divided by kWh used) because the daily service charge doesn't change. You use less electricity, so the price per kW for purchased electricity goes up a little, again, because of the service charge. Expected behaviour change because of being more aware of your consumption? Lucky dip. Some people use more total power because they reckon cheaper now, I'll take the comfort. As far as the economics, I used solarquotes.com.au and nothing on that website turned out to be incorrect, including the various calculators there. His output calculator matched at around 96% of what we're actually getting across multiple years. That impressed me. There's lots there and he's started to cover electric cars as well. With hindsight, you could say our system should have been bigger, but it was based on likely usage. It was based on our usage figures which was best practice at the time. Nowadays, provided you get approval for your area, maximise use of roof space, and I wouldn't put up less than 6.6 kW for a 4-bedroom house. Otherwise our system has been worry-free zero-maintenance, up until a couple months ago. Our system has been topping out at 2.5 kW lately. In past years I would see 3.3, 3.4 on good days, occasionally even 3.5. Called the company and they said $330 for a tech visit and assessment. We'll see how it goes. Panels are clean so it's not that. Hoping for a nest under one of them causing a hot spot or something else easy to fix. One bad panel could be doing it, and that could be disconnected. Hail damage? We've had the worst of hail (6cm) totaling cars on our road and didn't cause any issue for the panels, years ago. Inverter should last 12 years, and it's only 8, but ya never know, maybe it's a dud. So two years free electricity so far, and even at the lower output our savings is around the same because of higher $/kWh to buy power. 15 x LG 275W panels, SMA 4kW inverter"
"I bought my house 8 years ago with the panels already on it. 1.5kw system. Haven't paid for power yet, looks like I've got 6 months credit left aswell. I'm only home half the year though..."
No big possible building which can block your sun?
We have a 6.6kW system facing NE. Do most to all cooking and washing in the day. Heat pump HWS with no gas. We're in credit.
Amount of your bills divide by the amount of solar will cost and then by the left over time between when you are paid off and when you need to replace batteries/panels/move house.
"We have an 8 kilowatt system. In an average year it generates 10 MWh which equates to $2,500 worth of electricity at 25 cent per kWH. We consume all of that electricity so it comes straight off our bill. Payoff for the system is about 3.5 years. Probably 3 years or less now given how fast electricity prices are dropping. Fair warning feed in tarriffs are garbage now so if you are not using the electricity during the day and don’t have a battery, it’s not worth much."
"Thank you, yes I have noted that in research and existing posts. It seems like a bit of a rort that feed ins are so low!"
First year they were installed my bills were in credit. Then power rates went up and the solar feed in went down. Bills are still under $10 a month. This month bill is on track to under $2
Your power bills were similar to mine. How much you will save is going to depend on your usage. If you are like us and run ducted ac after the sun goes down then you are still going to get bills. We have a 6.6kw system added. When ac is off we can pretty much power everything using solar. With ac on however that’s another story. And again depends on the weather. 40 degree day the ducted ac will pull 8kw easily. Temp under 30 or late at night the ac will only be pulling 1.5kw. Happy to share some graphs if you are interested. For us it’s looking like a 50% saving but when you consider how much it cost it’s a no brainer
Good info thanks. Even 50% saving makes a good case for solar.
"WFH full time, have a spa, run AC pretty much all day. Got a 10kw system installed for $6500 Bills went down from around $800 per quarter to around $250"
Wow that sounds like a great price for 10KW. After lot of research the best I am getting is $5669 for 8KW solar. Are you in VIC? Mind sending me the retailer info?
"Sweet Jesus! $10k? We got 10.8kW of panels with an 8.2kW inverter back in 2016 which was as big as we could go on a single phase connection. We are big power users too with a pool and 5 air con units through the house. Before the FIT went to shit we actually used to have a small earnings buffer over the summer months (as in power company owed us money). Still totally worth it, just payback period is not as quick as it used to be. Given you have ducted air con you may already have 3 phase power. Back when I had my system installed having 3 phase opened up options for larger systems."

"Bills used to be 300 plus a month for a 4 bedder single storey. We have an all electric home and an ev. Last bill was 7 dollars, so I would say we are saving a fair amount."
Feed in tariff gone from 14c to 6c now hardly worth it. It initially knocked $400 per quarter but now only $200. Was worth it as we got a couple. Good years in. Now the payback period will never get there but at least it still halves bill. Till the next fit drop to 2c or whatever crap they come up with. Getting your hot water off peak is biggest thing.
See if you can get Globird. 20c FIT. Also I recently talked to Amber and they said if you're on (or have been moved to) AusGrid they can do 28-32c FIT.
"We spent 12k on a 6.6kw system plus 10.1 kw alpha ess battery. Household of 2 adults, no children. Electricity was $140 per month, nearly all electic house, running AC regularly, both WFH. Current bills are in CREDIT. Last month we earned $8. It was only $8 but better than receiving a bill. We let the credits rack up to cover costs in winter as there is less sun with shorter days etc. In winter , we don't get credits but our bills are only $15 to $20 So, from October to March - we make money, saving the full $140. From April to September, pay a small amount but still save $100 + per month. Best decision we ever made. Hoping to add an EV this year, and remove fuel costs as we will freely charge it from our panels."
"I should add, by March/April - at usually have about $50 credit - which will then cover about the first 2 bills of winter. Also, these savings are not just achieved by putting in solar and not changing behaviours. You need to unlearn your old thinking about on and off peak and modify behaviours to use more electricity during peak solar production (10am to 4pm). Time major appliances like dishwasher and washing machine to run during these times, change your hot water system to run during solar times etc)"
"Paid $9500 after rebate for a 10.3kw system. Previous bill was a winter bill so no air con running. Paid $700. Most recent bill, during which time we had a few weeks where there was an issue with our inverter (installer rectified under warranty), we paid $180. That includes air con being on after sunset."
"After in installed solar and moved my electricity and gas provider to GloBird Energy, I am now getting free electricity and gas due to the solar credits I am generating. Never been happier! Can't wait to see my next bill now. :) GloBird Energy referral - get $50 on signup"
Our fit been cut to 9c. So we save nothing
What about the reduction in bills? Or your bill before and after solar is the same?
See if you can get Globird. 20c FIT. Also I recently talked to Amber and they said if you're on (or have been moved to) AusGrid they can do 28-32c FIT.
"12.4kw panels (10kw inverter). Payback time is roughly 3.5 years - also on the best feed-in tariff in NSW (12c/kW). In general, getting PV is a no-brainer, just do it. But don't do battery."
Globird has 20c FIT
We paid $11500 for panels and batteries and have paid a bill in eight months .
How did you get solar and battery that cheap??!
My summer electricity bills went from $1200+ to $300. Winter bill is less than half of what is was. Absolutely worth it for us.
Nice! That's my hope.
"If you’re paying 5k in electricity you’ll definitely save a lot! You get the most value through you using the generated energy rather than selling to grid. I have a spa, all electric house.. reverse cycle for heating and cooling. My bill would be about 2800 without solar. With 4.4kw solar system it’s 1300 a year. I wish I had gone a bigger system. Plus living in Canberra, you can access act government 10 year interest free loan. I’d recommend ECG electrical. They did my parents in December. Very pleased with them. If you don’t know anything about solar, have a read of resources in solarquotes.com.au."
"Thanks for the rec and link, they are a company I have seen recommended in a fee places. And that is some solid savings."
ROI on solar for us is 2 years or less for a 15kw system for a 4 person household We spend a lot of electricity tho
Wow - that is a definite reason for solar!
"In WA so max solar system is 5.5kWh. We put our system in in June 2022 costing $4000. In the last nearly nine months it has saved us $1,042 based on actual meter readings and including a very small amount of FIT. We do have: a plugin hybrid electric vehicle which we try to charge during the day when possible a toddler in cloth nappies so we use the washing machine and tumble drier very frequently me working from home. Most days over winter it saves us $2-3, and in summer is more like $4-7 depending on how much we can use. We pay $0.33 for peak time power, and $0.20 overnight to charge the car. We get paid $0.225 per kWh from 00:00-15:00 and then $0.10 from 3pm"
so we moved into our house we bought about a year and a half ago which has 8 panels and we haven’t paid one electricity bill but have actually been in credit and paid money by AGL
"They will change the rules at some point like they are in SA, so the homeowner pays more. Energy companies aren’t just going to roll over and die."
My bills have stayed roughly the same that's because my energy use since buying a solar system have skyrocketed. We use way more aircon than we used to and we use our clothes dryer just about every day now too. I wish I bought a battery tbh.
Our quarterly bill went from 1200 in summer to less than 200. After three years the solar and battery is fully paid for
My bill was around the 500 mark.I work a 2/1 roster.I would of been happy with halved.just received my bill was like 3 dollars
"We installed 13kW (10kW inverter). Family of five, multiple PC's and pretty frequent ducted aircon usage. System cost about 10-11k. Bills used to be on average 600-700/quarter (and that's before all the recent price increases as that was a couple of years back), we've had the system about two years now and I only ever had one bill of like $80, every other one has been in credit. I seem to get the odd $120 cheque from the electricity provider too (yep an old school cheque). The only main change we have made is we run the dishwasher and washing machine in the daytimes. The hot water (electric) was put on the usual daytime timer to make use of the solar. Make sure you get consumption monitoring, so you can see how much you are using, as well as generating from the solar. By default most cheap systems just tell you your generation, but its nice to know your usage."
We have solar and a battery. We are a 2-4 person household (we have housemates that stay for shortish periods then move out). Our bills are generally around $250 a quarter. The system cost us about $10k altogether when we built the house so we incorporated the cost with our mortgage. I don’t know if we would survive without it tbh.
"Also look at solar panels as increasing the value of your home. It's an investment that A - saves you money, B - increases the value of an asset So yes 5 k that takes 5 years to break even but also gained value on potential LVR, future sale, ect how ever you structure your assets"
"Heating on winter mornings will be the hard part for us. Recently installed system is covering our modest summer electricity usage easily, and banking some FIT credits. Would easily cover daytime air-con (but we haven't needed it). In winter, we usually run aircon from 6am until about 9am (when it warms up). Most of that will still need to come from the grid. House has crappy/no insulation, so even if it's a warm day, and a fire keeps us toasty in the evening, by morning the place is freezing."
"Also in CBR, got a 6.4kwh system installed for 10k, 7k to me after govt certificates. Usually 3-400 pq, got a $250 credit for the last q because of a temporary 18c FIT. I've gone from buying ~10kwh per day to 2.5 as I run dishwasher, washing machine etc during the day. Ignoring FITs etc the install costs me a touch under 180pq over 10 years. Almost impossible not to pay for itself. Even if I abandoned by house and used no power and sold all power at 8c per kWh I'd break even."
"6.6kW system installed for around 4k last year. Bills were around $100-150 per month, now anywhere from -$10 to $25. We run 2 x split system air cons basically all day and I work from home 2 days per week. Absolutely worth it."
"I had a 10kw system installed in 2020, cost was about $5k.Average bills at that time were about $700/qtr.First year i had a great feed in tariff of 21c/kw and we had mostly sun for the year, all bills for the next year were in credit. With feed in tariff credits, the ROI was 2 years, so any savings i am making now are genuine savings. If your sales person is calculating your ROI based on a high feed in tariff, do your own numbers with the FIT you can find on your preferred suppliers website, because it could be a lot less. Best i can find now is 12c/kw. If you WFH, it's great. Do your washing, dryer, dishwasher, air con etc during the daylight hours when it's only using your solar. Set your air con/heat to automatically start 1.5 hours before you lose sun on the panels to pre cool/warm the house. Using the solar during the day is better than getting the low feed in tariff. I opted for a cheaper system based purely on my maths.
Quotes were up to 17k for a 10kw with all the bells and whistles and Samsung panels and microinverters etc.
I figured technology is improving all the time, panel efficiency is improving, i don't wan't my ROI to be 10 years and not be able to upgrade because i am still paying for it.
Might not be the right way for everyone, but it was the smart move for me."
"Paid about $5k for a 9.9kw system about mid last year. Have been in credit each bill since. With the hot weather we've had the ducted going most days of late so might actually eat into those credits, but overall, we are still in front."
Is that with any state gov rebates?
"Should receive my first bill after installing solar, expecting about half of my usual bill."
Got an 11.8 KW system on a north-south oriented house with no trees around and our last quarterly bill was in credit in our favour. Still yet to see what winter brings (I’m in the ACT) but our previous bills were around $400 per quarter in the summer and $600 per quarter in winter.
"Installed a solar and battery package in November 2021. System comprises of 21kW of panels, 5kW standard inverter & 10kW hybrid inverter and 13.8kWh of battery storage. Total cost was about $29k out of pocket. Calculated savings since install is ~$5,600 ($3,800 in exported credits and $1,800 saved by not having to purchase power from the grid)."
"Summer quarter is almost zero, winter quarter is halved, spring and autumn are about 30% of what they were. This is in Tassie and it’s only a 5kw system for 2 people. But one is home all day and our roof angle etc aren’t perfect. If the whole 10 year average on panels etc is right we’ll come out well ahead."
I have solar and we produce double what we use - we pay anywhere from $40-$60 a month depending on heatwaves. Used to pay $200+ a month
How long until it’s paid off? Is 5 years a good rule of thumb?
$300 to $400 per quarter pre solar. Last bill was $4. $25k 6.4kw system with Tesla battery.
I just got my first quarterly power bill. $52.00 on a 5kw system. So yeah. Saving A LOT!!
6.2kw (5kw) in Perth. Electric hear pump HWS and ducted AC in large 4x2. My bills have halved and I am definitely not acrimping with the AC use during summer. In hindsight I would sacrifice the aesthetics and have half installed on a West facing section of roof (currently all north) to utilise the late summer sun. My output drops right off by about 430pm yet the house across the road is still almost full output at 7pm.
"We just installed a 6kw panels, 5kw inverter system. Bills were usually $300 a month (pool and aircon and WFH). Latest bill was $178 but it’s missing 10 days of solar input as the solar was install during the billing period. I estimate we might save another $60 off the bill. Hot water is currently night rate but I am going to get a timer installed so it heats during the day instead. I’m hoping we can get down to around $80 bill, saving $220 per month. Winter will be less but less aircon and pool pumping too. System should pay itself off in 3-4 years. I’m in QLD, the sunshine state."
"Summer bill down from 1300 to $148. Six adult family, including shift workers and gamers, aircon running at night as well as during the day, depending on the day. House has 3 phase power so we went 11kw of panels and 7kw inverter."
"Is there a way we can find out if our bill/solar is optimised? I'm very green to this, and we don't seem to be saving all that much on our Origin bill. Our feed in credits for a month might amount to $20 and we have 20 panels installed. Any info, or a place to contact would be really welcome."
