"Coalition to impose ëcapí on renewable energy investment, Nationals leader says"

comment
"So the party of the ""free market"" wants to intervene in the market and actively destroy the climate at the same time, while preventing some of the cheapest and best renewable options we have? And their nuclear option is the most expensive option we have and the most time consuming of all? They really have no clue!"
"Not to mention, they're trying to destroy business investment from happening. Business investment that would create jobs in the regions. You know, where their constituents are. "
"""That's not enough! We demand more asbestos! MORE ASBESTOS! MORE ASBESTOS! MORE ASBESTOS!""

"‚ÄúWe want to send the investment signals that there is a cap on where [the Coalition] will go with renewables and where we will put them,‚Äù he said. This is exactly what the Coalition's backers want. To introduce uncertainty into the market to reduce investment and hence prolong coal as a resource.  There's no logical reason for a cap. Just empty words like ""calm"" and ""methodical"". Very rich from a political party that, and this can't be stated enough, have no plan. And if there is no plan, why do you need a cap? "
"Exactly. So they're the party of bad economic management, lack of foresight/planning, unfair market intervention, class/income disparity, investment uncertainty, climate change denialism, and worst of all climate wreckers, which will affect untold numbers of future generations around the world. Who would still vote for them?!"
renewable energy never needed to be a political issue..
Looking forward to the party that says people don't like wind farms in their area explaining where their nuclear plants are going to be built.
God he's a fucking flog in the party of fucking flogs.
And this is why farmers will never get my sympathy for suffering from the effects of climate change. Because they are the ones who continuously vote this mob in. They are shooting themselves in the foot.
"This is a boomer farmer talking to his boomer constituents on legacy media. Carbon trading is startingin 2030. It's been in the works since the early 2000s. What cunts like this and Barno are doing is muddying the waters. I'm a gen x farmer and this is how it's going to work. In 2030 the Paris accord reductions come in to effect. Then to meet or exceed these reductions big polluters are going to have to find low emmision products or buy offsets We as farmers are not required to be carbon neutral. We'll sell products with an emission score tied to it. These get kicked up the supply chain exactly like the gst. So I supply wheat. I pass on my emmisions, including the emmisions passed to me via fuel Fert etcetera. The buyer takes on those emissions and passes that onto the miller, the bread maker, then eventually the consumer. The opportunity we as farmers is to go through the audit process, take low emission product to market knowing our competitors with higher emmisions are going to make it hard to hit the Paris accord targets. I've Done the audit on my farming business. Efficiency and innovation are tied directly to low emmisions, and I've personally invested another half million in tech to reduce that even further. The old boys are shitting bullets because it's complex. I'm looking at it as one of the best marketing, product differentiation opportunities we've ever had."
"‚ÄúThe Coalition isn‚Äôt against renewables, but renewables should be in an environment they can‚Äôt destroy.‚Äù Y‚Äôknow, I bet he applies this logic consistently to all energy sources including coal."
The COALition
"Honestly, this guy has coal in his back pocket"
"""This is coal! Don't be afraid!"""
"It‚Äôs always amazing how just as Labor seems like it couldn‚Äôt be weaker, the LNP manage to be so much worse."
"""Guys we have them on the ropes, what should we do""
""What if we start punching ourselves in the face?"""
"Littleproud offered no details of the Coalition energy plan, only conceding ‚Äúit will take a little longer to get there‚Äù. ""But first let us cap the renewable energy investment for no obvious reasons than to be popular with some of our most backward donors. Also nuclear goes choochoo."". David Littleproud 2024 circa-"
"All about the free market until it goes against their interests , hypocrites"
We believe in the free market.... Wait no not like that!
"His face... I can't handle seeing it, it's just so... How has he survived this long? lol"
Got those punchable Young Liberal vibes with added chin rolls
Nationals now making it pretty clear why they're pretending to support nuclear energy.
Fuck you. So I‚Äôm not supposed to save money with my solar panels and battery and keep being slave to big businesses and bleed till I die.
"As ever, the nationals are an absolute joke and embarrassment"
I thought the coalition were suppose to be market liberals. Wtf is this interventionist nonsense
Is it sad that Barnaby the pisshead might actually be a better leader than this drop kick?
"The Beetrooter can be pragmatic when he has to be, but he's still a philandering, beetroot-faced pisshead. Both are total fuckwits."
They are both oxygen thieves...
Today in complete idiocy This will appeal to the hundred or so remaining active cookers in the country
Overall a dumb policy position
I'd like a cap too... Of LNP members in parliament
"Oil and Gas getting propped up by the tax payer for decades Liberals: ""This is fine"" Renewables getting investment Liberals: ""WE NEED A CAP!! THINK OF THE.... WHALES!"""
"Well, I'm definitely not voting for them."
L:ook at his gimp face.
David Littleproud da derp dee derp da teetley derpee derpee dumb!
Looks like someone should put a cap on David littleproud and his party - the amount of air they expel in a sitting day in parliament is enough to solve Australia's energy crisis with renewables
Coalition in 2018: We should let the market decide what energy mix we have! Coalition in 2024: We shouldn't let the market decide what energy mix we have! [Insert NPC not like that meme here]
"Moron, knobhead"
Conservatives will only believe in climate change when their house catches fire for the 3rd time.
It's incredible how much they attack capitalists in general in order to protect a tiny handful of mates in the coal and gas sectors. They even threatened investors choosing to shift investments away from fossil fuels.
Future generations will look back on these climate wreckers with complete disgust. I don't know how they sleep at night.
We should put a cap on how many fossil fuel handouts we give to foreign energy companies.
These fuckers are going to kill us all
Free market capitalism.
"Can this crap be referred to the anti corruption commission? Like, unless he's receiving payments of some sort, why would a politician say this shit?"
This cunt‚Äôs eyebrows makes my skin crawl.
It's the beady eyes that repulse me
"If you don‚Äôt know, vote NO (to the COALition‚Äôs nuclear policy)"
"What a fucking idiot. Meanwhile people in rural areas are waiting longer to see Doctors, specialists, surgery etc etc. So many issues in areas that the Nationals say they represent and all this little pissant does is hang off Duttons pocket like TBag in Prison Break."
"Hang on. So they want to cap private sector investment? I‚Äôm generally a centre right voter, think more like Turnbull than Morrison. One of the key things I believe in is private sector being able to invest and grow the economy (within sensible regulations). It would be one thing to cap government investment- all governments have a budget and must decide where to spend. But the government restricting private investment for political reasons? That‚Äôs a massive no from me, and shows why they are not ready to govern"
In Europe renewables eat the nuclear profits in same way renewables here make coal unprofitable. Reactors are regularly shut down because no one wants to buy their output when renewables are so cheap and available. And this is before batteries are widespread. Nuclear needs a lot of protection from the freemarket even today.
So they want to cap private sector investment? I does not seem to be
Is there a cap on donations to their mates?
Mr Little To Be Proud of. What more can you say. Next he will want a cap on Medicare funding so that he fund his coal powered mates.
Would they prefer we invest in the Horse & Cart industry!
Is this match fixing? Are the NLP trying to be unelectable?
"Hey guys, want to invest in infrastructure that will guarantee we can always meet our energy demands without destroying the environment.  No. Let's keep digging up shit that we'll eventually run out of, ensuring that it always goes up in value so the guys that put money in our pockets will be able to keep doing so. "
"If you can't knock it down dig it up or burn it, the Nats dont get it."
"Who...is this for? People don't want their ridiculous policies and big business doesn't want them either. Businesses are all heavily investing in renewables including the mining and energy sectors, they won't allow the coalition to get in to power if this is what it means because it will be less money for everyone. They are guaranteeing themselves a complete election wipeout...and to be honest I kind of want to see it happen. Absolute idiots."
Fuking idiots
"The look on his face says ""Look I can't believe the words coming out of my mouth either...but this is what we are going with"" He is either stunned that this policy exists or he is permastunned from being a fuckwit"
So in jabba the reinharts pocket...
So much for the free market ey. Hypocritical dickheads.
His last two braincells rotted away.
"If we all vote for minor parties it will send a clear, strong message that we've had enough. The ultimate chaos would be if it were close between the Greens and One Nation. One holding the House of Commons, the other taking the Senate. I'm not saying it could or should last. I just think it would be hilarious watching them go at it. Question Time would be the best thing on television! Oh well. One can dream."
"The end goal of the coalition policy is to funnel public money into private hands. In a future where they win government, they ask for tenders to build the plants. As incentive, they pony up some amount of taxpayer dollars. That public investment increases steadily over the years until the plants are built. By this time, several billion dollars of taxpayer money has been spent on this private enterprise. Now it's time for the public to benefit from the spending! We reap the reward of higher prices for power and our cash being diverted to private hands. But we get to feel good about our emissions until old mate atom smasher goes rogue and pollutes our environment. But that's okay, because the politicians who pushed this clusterfuck of idiocy on us might be dead and their progeny will have enough cash to move to where the wallabies don't have two tails. Hell! Even the clean up will be paid for by taxpayers. All the while, subsidies keep rolling into the pockets of the ""wise"" investors. Privatisation of public money, project 32c now complete!"
Which poll was that?
