Community pushback against renewable energy projects could see Australia miss its emissions targets and climate goals

comment
growing community opposition Citation needed.
The community of legacy power generation companies.
"Trust us, bro"
"Ah yes, it's the community pushback and not the massive mining approvals by Plibersek that are going to keep us extracting well into the future."
Energy expert Tony Wood says growing community opposition is threatening Australia's uptake of renewable energy projects It comes as the Australian government prepares to spruik its clean energy targets at a United Nations climate summit this week Mr Wood says more meaningful community consultation is needed to ensure Australia meets its climate targets
I love the smell of fresh bread.
"There is no facing extinction global warming bull-dust. It's only a matter of picking a rational option to have cleaner air without plunging the world back into starvation a century ago. We have tradeoffs to choose. Liars talk about zero-emission energy system. No such things as there is no such technology. Every supply chain spills emissions. China produces 80% of solar/wind hardware, using low cost coal fired power. The more you install solar/wind, the more China spills emissions, which causes global emissions to increase every year despite reductions in the West thanks to the latter's switch from coal to gas. A 5-megawatt wind tower uses the same amount of steel, carbon fibre, cement and space as a 500-MW gas fired power plant. Wind is more emitting than gas in full life cycle. You can burn 10 times the capital and still end up with higher emissions as a whole. That's called idiocy or insanity. If you switch from coal to gas, you cut emissions (gas power has half the emissions of coal power) and retain supply chain in the West. Then you expand nuclear power to take over baseload power supply from gas or in conjunction with gas. This is the only way to return to an affordable, lower emission energy supply system with national security benefits. When ppl talk about solar / wind being cheaper than fossil fuel electricity, they don't talk about back-up supply cost. Electricity supply must be 24/7, otherwise it's useless. Solar / wind cannot provide first-world power supply without back-up from fossil fuel supply. As solar / wind average capacity factor is 1/10-1/5 of fossil fuel plant, you must build 5-10 times the plant capacity of fossil fuel to hopefully get an equivalent amount of energy generated by fossil fuel plant. Further, consumers cannot rely on ""average"" capacity of solar/wind. At any time, a solar /wind farm can lose almost all its production due to cloud cover or wind shift. Hence, the grid must have excessive fast-response plant (gas/diesel fuelled) to ensure smooth back-up supply. This is called ""firming"" capacity. The more you build intermittent solar/wind plant, the more you must build gas/diesel plant. This is where you can burn 10 times the capital and still cannot get very far towards net-zero. You can use batteries to do instantaneous back-up supply to solar/wind. But batteries are for storage, not additive generators like fossil fuel plant. You must charge them (while also supplying grid demand) before you can discharge them for back-up use. Hence, you must overbuild solar/wind/gas/diesel even more to do the charging - more capital spend. Batteries cost 3 times gas plant and can last only 2-3 hours, with plant life 1/3-1/4 that of gas/diesel plant so you have to keep replacing them. If your solar/wind system is down longer than couple hours, you have blackout or brownout. No way to run an industrial economy on that kind of power system. To back up solar/wind long term, you must keep building more and more gas/diesel plant. The latter can keep generating as long as there is gas/diesel to run. Superbly reliable. The only technology that can give you such baseload power without emissions at point of generation is nuclear energy. When comparing cost, you must do so apple with apple. To have usable 24/7 power supply, the cost of solar/wind/battery is many times higher than fossil fuel as currently, and also higher than nuclear. If nuclear has the time, commercial focus and government subsidies that governments in the West have thrown at solar/ wind over the last 20-30 years, it will be the cheapest and cleanest power supply system soonest. And the West is self sufficient in nuclear energy. As governments push societies further and further into the solar/wind/battery quagmire, power tariffs at consumer level have kept and will be keeping on rising. There is no escape. You can bring power cost down and build a sovereign (not relying on the China supply chain) system by going gas for next 20-30 years while filling the system up with nuclear energy over time. This is also the most effective way to lower global (Nox, Sox etc) emissions - for cleaner air, not necessarily believing in the humanity-threatening warming bull-dust."
