The Spectator is the RenewEconomy of the right.
Lol. I hate renew economy as well but at least it publishes actual science and data. The spectator lost me after it's Chris pyne bash
"An endgame is now underway in the renewable energy scam that has been responsible for destroying the nationâ€™s electricity industry as a low-cost, efficient and self-managing sector. Though, in Churchillian terms, countering the debilitating effect of the self-imposed cancer is beyond the end of the beginning it has a long way to go before we have anything like the market we once had. Ha ha ha ha ha !!!!!"
"Tony Abbott, again proving his formidable skills as a politician Ha ha ha, this gets better and better !!!"
Subsidy for power should be zero the market should decide if it's needed. But let's be fair fossil fuel got 276 million in subsidy off the govt last year ...or is this still not a thing in this world. You need to present both sides of the argument not just the one you want Maybe it's time the market got a punishment from the govt it's stupid that the company's can build a substation in the hunter for 50 million and still 3 years later has had zero users passed through it they are working the money we pay them on things just to justify the costs. Costs can not keep rising the way it has When i read these comments of yours this comes to mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c
"Fossil fuel generation is not subsidised regardless of your claims. Meanwhile, renewables tap the government for $5B per year and rising so that we can have a more expensive and less reliable energy system with no measurable difference to global CO2 concentration."
Maybe this would be a good time to remind everyone that ALL coal power stations in AU were paid for by the government . Best subsidy ever.
It's like you didn't read the article at all
