Renewable energy subsidies undermine our economy

Scrap fossil fuel subsidies first. Then we’ll see :)
  
"Australia has greater natural wealth per head of population than anywhere else in the world. With good government focused on protecting property rights, ensuring law and order, we would have the highest living standards in the world. The fact that we are falling short – and increasingly so – of our potential is due entirely to government. The Commonwealth, over the past few decades, has increased its share of the nation’s spending from under 20 per cent to over 26 per cent of GDP and has run up half a trillion dollars of debt. We have seen similar increases from state governments – increases that have actually been accompanied by reduced service provision as a result of many former roles having been privatised. Norway is the safest place in the world and number one in the world for protecting property rights. It has a higher standard of living than us. Take a wild guess at what their government expenditure to GDP is...40% (double ours). Get out of here with this crap."
  
"Well that article is a load of crap. The author tries to tie the push for renewable energy and the subsidies for it to a decline in productivity. Their argument is that the subsidies cause less investment in mining and inturn causes productivity to go down. That coal is good and keeps power prices down when that isn't the case anymore. You can look at the CSIRO report to see that https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/energy/GenCost The reason productivity has gone down would be due to overinvestment in housing, previous governments lack of energy policy and companies not investing in developing new technologies."
"Yeah the dudes a cooker. His twitter bio had ""green radicals"" under his dislikes lol"
"Houses are essential shelter, they should never have been made vehicles for investment and that is what needs to be progressively undone, not simply build more houses."
   
"I could barely get through half of this absolute garbage before I had to stop or risk vomitting from my eyes lol. The reason the world is less productive is because of governments? We have too many regulations? Who wrote this google or Amazon. Also, the section about how the government is the reason we have wasted our natural resources is kind of true, but the point isn't, let's fuck regulation off. It's let's not let Gina Reinhart and her ilk own the government and basically just ship our raw materials overseas for no benefit to the Australian population. Maybe get everyone's fucking wealth out of housing? Makes it a bit hard to use that wealth to create shit when housing just absorbs it all and sits around doing fuck all. But you need some more regulation and taxes for that so apparently that can't possibly be right. To the articles author I say, What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent article were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
The irony of housing is that many people mainly only use it for the purposes of sleeping securely: that's quite an expense and an under-utilisation.
