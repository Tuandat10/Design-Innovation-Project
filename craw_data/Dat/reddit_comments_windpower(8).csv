"Australia Joins the Offshore Wind Energy Trend, Announces Its First Three Projects"

comment
seems like offshore wind has really taken off this year. everyone want to build it.
"As stated by BlueFloat Energy, the first floating wind farm will be the Hunter Coast Offshore Wind Project, with a capacity of 1.4 GW, and will be located off the coast south of Newcastle, in the Hunter Coast region of NSW (New South Wales). It will be meant to support the revitalization of the region as it transitions from coal-fired power. The second project will also use floating wind technology and will be the Wollongong Offshore Wind Project, with a capacity of 1.6 GW. It will be located across two sites off the coast of Wollongong in the Illawarra region of NSW. This project is meant to support the existing ecosystem in the region and facilitate the growth of new industries, such as green hydrogen for export and domestic markets such as mobility. The third one will be the Greater Gippsland Offshore Wind Project and will use bottom-fixed technology. It will have a capacity of 1.3 GW and will be located off the coast of the Gippsland region of Victoria. With this wind farm, BlueFloat Energy and Energy Estate hope to put an end to brown coal projects in the La Trobe Valley."
"Wow! SA is already running a giant grid at virtually 100% solar and wind. Offshore wind has the highest capacity factor and output of RE and they're about to start adding it to the mix! This is going to be so very interesting... Also, the $2.3 billion power interconnector hooking up NSW with South Australia, which is expected to unlock more than $20 billion in new renewable projects in both states, has been granted environmental approval by the SA government.!!"
this might solve the issue that we have with poor transmission networks. Most of the population is on the coast so offshore wind will be able to plug directly into the areas where the power is needed.
