Does nuclear power have a future in Australia? These numbers will help cut through the debate

comment
    
The section on Nuclear Waste is very import. The CSIRO costings avoid this and so do most media and politicians.
 
It's a shame to see the lengths experts will go to avoid an honest talk about Nuclear Energy https://youtu.be/CDLH-qEFfCY?si=ccSJ1pL5Cly-Po3_
"You don’t believe CSIRO’s figures, but you believe one statement that you copied word for word from summary at the top of the World Nuclear Association’s home website?"
"I do not believe these figures. Today nuclear power is cost-competitive with other forms of electricity generation, except where there is direct access to low-cost fossil fuels. Absolutely - the current twisting of facts for partisan political gain is going to be harmful to Australia in the long term. While I'd expect nothing less from the Greens, I am surprised at how many of the sensible economic rationalists within the ALP's right are entirely missing from the national discussion when traditionally they would be pushing back against their left wing. And for those here who aren't inclined to read through the above link - here's a simple video from an impartial youth oriented science educator which contradicts many of the Greens / ALP anti-nuclear talking points:- Is nuclear power really that slow and expensive as they say? It is a great shame that the ABC cannot be an impartial and honest publisher of information in this national debate."
"I don't think people disagree that nuclear is expensive. But it's kind of not the point. The point is the same reason hospitals and particular businesses have backup generators, The can't afford the power to go out. Can Australia afford the power to go out because 'nuclear bad, expensive'….?.If not nuclear, then what? Or should I say watt."
"People dont understand how dramatic a change batteries and electric vehicles will have on electricity distribution. In Australia, about a third of houses have solar panels, image when that many have batteries as well, if there are 3m houses with 5kw batteries, that's 15GWh per day of potential dynamic load balancing. Add to that electric vehicle batteries (i.e. Tesla model 3 has 82kWh battery), there is an enormous amount of storage coming onto the grid. The stability of the grid will become more about how that storage capacity is managed, and dynamic pricing so households (and vehicles) can be actively trading their stored energy. Demand response will likely come into it, some things wont be done when energy prices spike, eg electric hot water, or industrial scale processes like smelters rigging their operation to scale up when prices are cheap and scale back when its expensive. Your hospital can have a big battery, it wont be a problem. It's never going to be the same again, but people are trying to make a plans that would work in the past."
It’s not the only point. The others are that it takes too long to build and it poorly compliments renewables. It’s much faster and cheaper to design around the limitations of renewables than to deploy a fleet of nuclear reactors.
  
"Whose electorate are you going to put the reactor in ,and what river are you going to use to cool the reactor . Once these questions have been answered then you can ask yourself where the waste is going and why you would want the most expensive electricity generation available. This whole nuclear argument is just a distraction so the LNP can prolong the life of coal . Prove me wrong Reddit go on"
"Another day, another article about the opposition’s, not the government’s, but the opposition’s theoretical nuclear power theoretical policy. For all the Thick of it fans: I cannot believe the energy going into Dutton’s Nuclear policy! Aaaak!"
It truly is strange how much media attention the opposition's vague statements regarding nuclear energy gets.
"At this point the headline seems very naive. ""If only people had the facts, then we could all agree on a rational course of action."" This was never about not having the data."
"It all being in one place is handy, makes it harder for people to be selective/naive about inconvenient data, and harder for extremists to get away with extremist numbers."
"Even if you ignore the costings the 2 damming numbers are 10years 
In its latest plan, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) predicted 90 per cent of coal power would be gone from the grid within 10 years, and the final power station would be shut by 2038, just 14 years away.   13years The only country in the world that has managed to successfully build nuclear from scratch in the last 30 years is the United Arab Emirates (UAE). From the time the UAE decided to develop a nuclear power program, it took 13 years to deliver the first of four reactors.  The cost, in 2018, was stated to be $US24 billion ($36 billion).  We have an aging coal fleet that are all in or heading into their end of serviceable time of life. And the UAE could only get it done in 13 years, they are an authoritarian state and as such do not have the same NIMBY or regulatory issues we will have in Australia, they aren't held accountable by an electorate. The ABC actually missed another 1 here, Bangladesh have also established their first nuclear reactor that is scheduled to open this year. If we are being generous the program began in 2010 but really it was proposed in 2007. These are Russian reactors, something we wouldn't ever consider and were built by Russia. Again Bangladesh are closer to the UAE in terms of government accountability than a democratic state like Australia. All this and we haven't even touched the costings."
Ah authoritarian state that uses slave labour for construction. That would have knocked billions of the cost for them.
"I guess that 10 or 13 years, would start after government passed legislation allowing it. Its an extreme long shot for the Coalition to win government in the next election (likely before May25), so legislation to allow it wouldnt be passed untill probably after May'28. And every day the decision is delayed we get more renewable and batteries at ever cheaper prices."
"Nuclear isn't a replacement for renewables, it isn't either/or. That is my only opposition to nuclear: the way that the Liberals keep positioning it."
"Unless they work out how to make intermittent nuclear power it actually is a bit of a replacement. It’s hard to pair up renewables and nuclear because nuclear plays no firming role. It could be used to power some industrial uses, particularly if various industrial processes become electric and we figure out cheap hydrogen electrolysis. That all said. Nuclear is very expensive so it seems unlikely."
"I am on the fence on this because I feel like people on both sides of this argument act like religious zealots and revert to name calling instead of facts. Is nuclear expensive? Yes. We get that. My concern is still with renewables no one has really come across and confidently said how we deal with extreme events, land clearing for solar farms etc? Materials need go be mined just to produce solar panels etc. If anyone has any unbiased links to honest discussions I'm happy to read."
It doesn't sound like you are on the fence. My big concern with nuclear is waste. This is never discussed by the proponents of nuclear. I would argue that there are plenty of discussions on the problems with renewables that you have outlined.
"I can answer your questions. 1. I can’t answer broadly for extreme events. But all renewable installations are built to a certain risk tolerance, just like a power station. The less risk tolerance, the more expensive. So it’s a trade off. One the reasons nuclear power is expensive is that the stations have to be built to a very very low risk tolerance. Inevitably power generating institutions will go down (as happens to power stations). We all remember Fukushima I’m sure. Renewables are actually structurally (not engineering) more resilient because we rely on so many dispersed installations that losing an installation is easily managed. If a significant portion was lost (similar to losing a whole power station) then the excess capacity in the grid is spun up (and grids always have excess capacity). If there isn’t enough excess capacity built in, you get failures like in Texas where the cold snap stopped the operation of several coal and gas stations. It all depends on the system design. You can have less and more resilient electricity systems whether renewable, nuclear, or fossil fuel. It’s a question of how much money you’re willing to spend on it. In a way. Putting more expensive nuclear to provide security in case say a cyclone takes out offshore into the mix (putting nuclear tail risk aside) is simply another way of trading off cheaper power for more security. In short. There’s no inherit reason renewables are less secure. It’s a question of the entire grid’s design. 2. As for solar land use. There is naturally no solution to this. Your options are to (if you don’t want to cover hundreds of square kilometre of land) is to build more wind instead. Of course we also cover a significant portion of the land in agriculture so I would be more concerned about that than solar. The ANU thinks we need 1200 square kilometres of land. https://iceds.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/no-threat-farm-land-just-1200-square-kilometres-can-fulfil-australia%E2%80%99s-solar-and"
They don't clear land for solar panels. Sheep graziers are starting to embrace solar farms particularly in marginal land. https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2022-05-30/solar-farm-grazing-sheep-agriculture-renewable-energy-review/101097364
"Is nuclear expensive? Yes. We get that. This is the biggest blocker for Nuclear power generation in Australia. It was the issue back and 2005 when Howard did his big Nuclear push, and it's the issue now that Dutton is trying again. It's so expensive and the ROI so long that industry does not expect it's ever going to happen in Australia."
Have a read of this. it gives a basic high level trade study/requirements analysis of siting of nuc plants. They need to be in close proximity to the ocean for once through cooling (FACT) that so many nufties easily overlook. The cooling of nucs is 25% greater than coal. The majority of the nucs inthe world draw water from cold oceans and lakes. One nuc plant in the USA uses 1 trillion litres of water a year for cooling. chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Nuclear-siting-40_10.pdf
"Nuclear isn’t designed to replace renewables. Its there to ensure a baseload that would otherwise need to be supplied by gas, coal or battery. Wind/Solar cannot be guaranteed for baseload. Waste is the issue, as well as expertise to build it properly"
"Numbers will NEVER help cut through the debate unless you’re a neutral party who doesn’t use science or economics figures to back up a narrative. This is an ideological argument, not a rational one. It’s team nuclear vs team renewables, and don’t pretend that it’s anything more than that."
"Is it more team status quo versus low emissions generation? I think most ""team renewables"" would jump on the nuclear bandwagon if it was viable. As the important thing is to reduce emissions not what technology we use."
I’m pro nuclear and pro renewables. This isn’t a team sport for me. But it’s obvious from the numbers that nuclear isn’t appropriate for Australia anytime before 2050.
"They’re unsafe. I don’t need to know how much they cost, how long they take to build, etc. They produce unsafe wastage and they’re subject to meltdowns, regardless of how infrequently, it’s still a possibility. It’s a matter of safety for me."
"Nuclear power is the safest energy in the planet per kw/h. More deaths are contributed from renewables than nuclear, especially if you disregard that old Soviet designs. More radioactive waste is pumped into the atmosphere by coal plants. The Australian government successfully scared the Australian people of nuclear years ago with a campaign because of the coal mining industry, and it’s still working today. Kyle Hill on YouTube does a great job explaining the pros, cons, and technology of nuclear power if you want more information, but I suspect you don’t. https://m.youtube.com/@kylehill"
"Lets talk waste and safeness, since those are reasonable concerns. Waste: Until we have some sort of mass-scale capture and store, or other replacement for baseline we're stuck with coal and gas fired plants. Coal isn't clean and homogenous, it's a mineral dug out from the ground containing trace amounts of Uranium and Thorium (including their isotopes). When you burn coal you throw all the other elements out into the environment, so if you live within a couple of hundred km of a coal plant you're getting exposed to higher levels of ""radioactive waste"", and radiation, than someone who lives next door to a nuclear plant. And that's on top of the greenhouse gas issues. There are types of reactors that either produce very little waste, or can reprocess spent fuel to use as new fuel to reduce the small amount of waste they make. For what's left ( including the reactor itself) after 40 - 80 years or so of service you can safely dispose of it - it just costs a lot of money. It involves a gigantic hole in the ground and lots of concrete, that costs a lot more so many governments take cheaper / less safe approaches. If we want to go down the path of Nuclear it's up to us to push for safe disposal. Safety: Nothing's completely safe, but with Nuclear there is a lot more effort and cost focussing on safety (similar to the effort that goes into building a plane vs building a car) . That's the #1 reason it costs so much and takes so long. When you look at other disasters that have happened, and potential disasters, they tend to fall into the buckets of: Unstable environment (e.g. Earthquake, Tsunami) - Australia is lucky we have lots of stable places we can build to avoid this Bad design and human incompetence (Chernobyl) - simple to learn from and not use that type of reactor Similar for 3-Mile Island etc. War - pretty stable on that front and lets face it if someone starts attacking us (like China) we're so far away their only option is ICBM nukes anyway. And that's ignoring designs like molten salt that need the salt bath to maintain the reaction so if it blows off the reaction stops - meaning they can't meltdown. So compared to other choices for maintaining consistent load safety wise we have : Lithium battery tech for your house/car - far less safe than Nuclear, far more likely to burn your house down due to a fault (so great a chance many ebikes and scooters are getting banned from high-rise buildings). The safety tolerances just aren't there Coal... already discussed plus the risk to your safety if the greenhouse effect runs away gas-fired. better than coal but still pumps greenhouse gasses out which we can all agree are bad for long term health and safety Pumped hydro - probably the way to go but also difficult and costly, and there aren't a lot of great sites for it (and snowy 2.0 keeps getting bogged, it's starting to look like the only project that will cost more and take longer than Nuclear) Don't forget most of the Greenpeace fear-mongering was based on funds and info provided by shell corporations acting for the Coal and Fuels industries. We already have 1 reactor (Lucas Heights) - it's where most of the isotopes for medical use in Australia come from. By all means look at Nuclear as a poor choice from a cost / implementation time frame (we should have done this 20 years ago) , but you're not being realistic if you think it's bad (or significantly worse I guess) from a safety / waste perspective."
Do you drive a car?
"I don’t need to know how much they cost, how long they take to build, etc. You should know these things because they are the actual reasons why nuclear isn't suitable in Australia. Safety and waste are non-issues. By focusing on these non-issues, you're helping nuclear proponents shift the conversation to an area where they can demonstrably win the argument. There's no answer to the insane costs and build times; there is an answer for waste (they produce almost none) and safety (they are statistically the least likely energy source to kill anyone)."
Like you’re objectively wrong but if it’s thoughts like this that are keeping people from supporting the coalition’s attempt to delay climate action I can’t complain
"You are wrong mate I worked right next to one and sleep not far from them,not once did our detectors ever notice an icrease nuclear reactors by pure stats are the safest form of energy Look how many ppl die from coal ash each year,vs die from nuclear power Yes there have been some high impact accidents,but they are all man caused not the issue with the technology itself"

Based on tech that is currently commercially available/viable.
"The aim is net zero by 2050. Any technologies that are decades away won’t be part of that plan but may be useful afterwards. There are plenty of approaches to ensure renewables are reliable such as oversupply, network balancing, firming, etc. None of this should be news to you."
