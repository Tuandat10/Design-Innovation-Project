Labor has a plan for a future made in Australia

comment
95.4% of voters won’t see this.
Rip in! Next week people will be saying albo is too soft because this won't make it to the 6pm news and they never saw it. This is anything but soft.
“Smirk and Mirrors” :)
"You know what? Fuck it, this guy is getting my vote."
"Albanese is the Prime Minister we need. Don't argue with me, Liberals do not have our back. Never have, never will."
Imagine becoming the new prime minister of Australia after the state the LNP has left it in over the past decade
"Australia needs to look within to establish a robust manufacturing industry to allow us to weather what is to come, be it conflict, natural disasters or civil unrest. We have negligible fuel stores. If we were cut off from the world we would run out of pharmaceuticals amongst other things. I’m not entirely sure that’s something the Australian people understands."
"News Corp have already started stirring by claiming the Albo's small target strategy won't work, and Morrison is ""challenging"" Albo to reveal his 2050 targets policies. Albo needs to: Maintain the small target strategy. Attack Morrison. Don't get baited on climate change policy. Aim to implement policy whilst in Government, not for twitter likes and pats on the back whilst in Opposition."
Then why do they keep voting with the Lib/Nat govts. on shit they should be opposing?
because opposing it would literally be pointless apart from moral grounds. and every time they do the Murdoc media crucifies them on it.
"They don't, this talking point is not true. Compare Albo and Brandt's voting records below. https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/grayndler/anthony_albanese/friends https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/melbourne/adam_bandt/friends"
"Hear, hear!"
I've never been a fan of Albo but that was a glorious roast of the Morrison government. Not sure if I trust Labor but he certainly said all the things I want to hear from my potential government.
“But there’s no costing” says pro coal liar.
This is the first thing longer than a sound bite I have heard Albo say. And I would care to hear more.
He has a YouTube channel.
Follow his Instagram too if you want to hear more.
"Does not matter, Liberals have fucked the economy by letting big business pay no tax and Fraudberg letting his mates steal Billions in Jobkeeper. No money, too much debt and that will be their hurdle as usual."
I don't believe it's good news. 2050 is 30 years away and they're not going to do shit.
Wow coherent and understandable thoughts. I always thought they just insult each other and do nothing. Good to see
"I wasn’t sure about Albo and this is the video I needed to see. I want to see more of this, everywhere."
"Watching videos of parliament disappoints me so much. I agree with what Albo is saying here but his tone and his puns and colloquialisms just turn me off so much. He is addressing parliament on the failures of the government and the Prime Minister during a crisis and accusing them of not having the vision to sufficiently prepare the country for the next one and he is treating it like a stand up show. Can the man at least try to have some gravitas? Also, if the leaders of our country could stop using the word 'mob' that would be fucking great."
Hoping he wins next year. My bloody electorate has been a Liberal safe seat for too long. Time for a change.
"Actually seems like sound policy. I really hate that labor took Andrew Leigh, who has heaps of experience in applied economic policy and kicked to the back bench cause he wasn’t factional enough. Labor took one of their brightest MPs and demoted him cause he wasn’t playing internal power games. It’s a real shame. For anyone interested look up Leigh’s academic work, he’s done a lot of work on inequality in Australia."
Shame there was nobody in the Coalition there to listen to the speech. Where were they?
Hawaii
"""Labor has always seen the light on the hill... as being critical. This Prime Minister is the gas-light on the hill."""
"These seem like some quality plans. Can't wait to see the public vote them down in exchange for... Fuck, which nonsensical non-issue do you think it'll be this time? But seriously, don't lose hope that Labor can win this, or you'll have to rely on my strategy, which is voting to spite the Coalition and so I know the bullshit we'll see if they win again won't be my fault."
Doesn't matter the boomers and older gen x will still vote LNP because they are worried the value of their 2nd property might be impacted
Where the fuck is the other half of parliament?!
I hope it includes a citizens bill of rights amendment to the constitution with provisions for personal privacy both digital and analogue
"Like almost everything labour comes up with, it's never thought out and always comes up short."


That literally could be the Lib's main election slogan. Cause a slogan is all it takes for the fuckwits of this country to vote against their own self interests. How good are Aussies?
 
Without a bipartisan parliament like Japan or Korea that is committed to manufacturing while also having politicians in parliament who come from a manufacturing dynasty I can’t comment on Japan but in Korea the “manufacturing dynasty” is pretty corrupt and always behind political scandals. Think of them as our mining lobby but with far greater reach… much like the umbrella corporation in resident evil.
