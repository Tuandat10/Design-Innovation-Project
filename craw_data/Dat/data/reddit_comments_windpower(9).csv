"If this is the case, why do all the Australian power companies charge a premium for wind power? That is on top of the already heavily taxed power and heavily subsidised green energy."
"The title is a little misleading. Wind power is cheaper ($/kWh) than power generated from a newly constructed coal-fired power station. Pre-existing power stations (built in the '70's) have had their installation cost amortised over 40 years, meaning that their per kWh cost is much lower. Source: Renewable Energy Engineer."
About time. Still waiting for ocean current turbines take off.
"Hmmm, is that really a thing? Compared to damming a river it doesn't seem like it would work that well."
"Be careful not to double-count carbon emissions. For example, if Aussie coal is burnt in Japan (where most of it goes), then would you count these carbon emissions as Japanese or Australian? (Obviously, you can't count it as both.)"
"I would like too see a break down showing where the money for these things goes. Production (also where and what epa laws govern thier assembly), shipping, installation and land owners, ect. Any body got a link to a more current study?"
"Electricity can be supplied from a new wind farm in Australia at a cost of A$80 ($84) per megawatt hour, compared with A$143 a megawatt hour from a new coal-fired power plant or A$116 from a new station powered by natural gas when the cost of carbon emissions is included Yes, you can make anything cost more than anything else if you TAX it."
"Australia prices CO2 emissions at $23 per tonne. Coal emits about 1 tonne of CO2 per MWh: $143 - $23 = $120, which is still 50% more expensive than wind, even without the carbon tax. Natural gas emits about 470 kg of CO2 per MWh: $116 - (0.47*23) = $105, which is still 31% more expensive than wind, even without the carbon tax. Coal and gas are already more expensive than new-generation wind, even without a carbon tax."
"That was the whole point? As opposed to subsidising carbon heavy sources as has often been done, unfortunately in retrospect."
"The problem is not the cost/kWhr that is the issue with. It's the control over when those kWhrs get produced. With coal it is very reliable, feed coal (or any other fossil fuel) into power station, get power out. With wind it is very unreliable, build power station, hope to get power out. Now if I was a consumer and wanted to keep my freezer running all the time, which system of power do you think I'll choose."
"Hopefully you'd choose a cheap renewable system, with a more expensive non-renewable system as a backup. It's not as if a country only has one power plant."
"It'd be hilarious if they used wind energy to drill that new oil reserve they found, so they can sell it overseas."
Which is why building new coal plants is essentially obsolete(except in china where they hell bent on destroying the world).
"China has a $19,000 per vehicle subsidy for electric vehicles."
"Is it really that China is hell bent on destroying the world, or is that they think they'll do better pursuing cheaper energy no matter what while the rest of the world through policy pursues more expensive/cleaner energy for them?"
$84 per MWh is really reasonable. The only form of energy in the US that is cheaper is Natural Gas (about $70/MWh). I believe or wind cost is in the $100/MWh range (within $10 of that). Granted there are many factors that they may or may not be including that could make this not perfectly apples to apples.
"the cost of the carbon tax/trading scheme ($23/ tonne) actually substantially undervalues the total (long term) cost of CO2 emissions, the price will be raised gradually over time to reflect the true cost. So, with LESS than the total cost, coal is still more expensive. We wont know the ""exact"" cost to humanity of CO2 emissions until its too late. There is actually a section of legislation in Australian state laws called the Precautionary Principle, which basically says: in situations of uncertain impacts, we must act with what we DO know to prevent as much environmental damage as possible, rather than waiting around indefinitely for better info (while everything goes to shit). From what is known about fossil fuels and wind power, environmental damage costs in the long term for FF are much greater than wind. Also, on this ""cheap (fossil fuel) energy"" argument: the world will run out of cheap (in the short term costings) fossil fuel energy, so alternatives must be introduced to enable a transnational period. A gradual transition is needed for predictable energy prices, predictable prices encourages economic investment(lower risk investment), which leads to growth and jobs etc. Switching suddenly to another energy generation method when we run out of fossil fuels requires shittonnes of research and development and investment in unproven things etc which causes economic instability(high risk investment) which discourages investment. Im not saying wind is a cure all either, with current technology anyway."
"I CALL BULLSHIT. Relying on fossil fuels to produce electricity is getting more expensive because of the governmentâ€™s price on carbon emissions imposed last year, higher financing costs and rising natural gas prices, BNEF said. The cost of wind generation has fallen by 10 percent since 2011 on lower equipment expenses, while the cost of solar power has dropped by 29 percent. They are showing the end PRICE not COST. The end PRICE is lower because Australia subsidizes wind energy while it taxes coal into the ground. The story reports the final PRICE after the government has meddled in the market. The true COST isn't discussed. I understand that... price = cost to the consumer, but the article was very misleading. Cost to consumer (after taxes, subsidies, ect) is not equal to cost to produce."
"Lol, coal is one of the most heavily subsidized commodities in Australia. Take your ignorance elsewhere."
"The government actually subsidises coal in several ways, coal is subsidised more than renewables in general, and the taxes on coal are fairly low too. Total cost of coal is much higher in the long term when the environmental impact is taken into account."
"This is the whole point of the Carbon Tax. The idea is to accelerate the economics involved to make developing alternative, carbon neutral generation a more economically enticing option decades earlier than would naturally occur. The Carbon Tax is an input in this equation, to ignore it misses the point completely. This article shows that the carbon tax is working to alter the economics, whether or not it will work to change generation and industry practices is still to be seen."
"The true COST isn't discussed. Your use of ""true COST"" is quite ironic. Coal has heaps of negative externalities that are normally not factored into the price. The carbon tax goes some way towards correcting for this, which allows the market to produce more efficient outcomes - the cost is now undoubtedly closer to the ""true COST"" than it has ever been in the past."
http://www.climatespectator.com.au/news/co2-emissions-3-2011-australia-worst-capita-basis I know this won't be popular but I'll leave this here. brace for impact My point being that if only all the high CO2 emissions (per capita) countries would put more money into Renewables we wouldn't be looking at (potentially) a 3-4 degree celsius increase in mean world temperature.
I would like Australia to build a nuclear reactor or a thorium fuel cycle 100km from Melbourne so I can work there and earn all the money's.
Wind energy has always been cheaper. It's just the harnessing of it that's getting cheaper.
"Honestly, it's irrelevant. The cost for coal is (literally) human extinction or at least an unbelievable pruning back that our civilization can't survive. We have to quit that now and push like mad at getting wind and solar out there. If we hit +3 degrees C, the brakes come off and the rise from there to +6 is handled by mother nature herself in the form of massive methane releases from the current permafrost. +6 degrees C equals mass extinction."
renewables rock!!!!
