"Good work Victoria, pretty stark contrast in views between the vic labor and QLD labor. One makes a 50% renewable target law, the other passes legislation to make it easy to put people protesting coal plants in jail."
"Coal is exported from NSW and QLD, its why they are hooked on it. In Vic its just for power."
"I mean, VicPol doing a pretty stellar job of pepper spraying and arresting protesters in Victoria this week too."
Queensland Labor also have a target of 50% renewable energy by 2030. And the Victorian government seems pretty happy to have a creeping police state that targets climate protesters. I really don't think they're that different from one another. They just market themselves differently.
"Although it can seem we have too many levels of government for such a small population, we need to be thankful for the states sometimes. Imagine how little progress we'd have made on climate change without them."
Cities too. Some of the best climate action being taken around the world is by municipal governments working together to come up with plans to keep their cities functional. It's national governments that are getting increasingly dysfunctional around the world as the global economic landscape is changing faster than their ability to adapt.
"Earlier this month, the bill voted through parliament’s upper house following several hours of debate, with 25 votes to 14 – and despite a strong show of opposition from the Liberal Party. I can't help but laugh at just how impotent the Liberal Party have become in the Legislative Council."
"Well done, now for the other Labor states to follow !"
How hard is it for a future LNP government to remove the law? Because we know that they will.
"Good to see some progress being made here, but 50% by 2030 is not nearly enough. We must totally zero out our net emissions by 2030 or else we face an absolutely catastrophic derailment of the global climate. Mother Earth doesn't care about our good intentions. Radical political action is required now, or we're fucked. Simple as that."
Seems like people either underestimate how long it takes to reduce to zero emissions or don't realize 2030 is only 10years away.
"If we'd started earlier we could do it slower, but there's little choice now."
Be interesting to see how poorer countries are impacted by this.
"Andrew Bolt: ""So Victoria has passed voluntary euthanasia again and has literally died. There is no electricity here anymore."""
Ahh bolty. We victorians live to trigger his inevitable stroke
"Great, when can we get the law to make Pi a nice round number too? Now if they said carbon neutral, I’d be a lot more confident. As unpleasant as it is we need to put nuclear back on the table."
Great to see Victoria taking a stand while NSW continues like this
Its great news...the Victorian government should seriously start working achieving the Victorian Energy Upgrades program Targets.
Victoria is always the first or last state for anything.
I think we got beat to this one by South Australia if I recall correctly.
"A friend who works in renewables thinks this is great for him, but not for us. Apparently it’s going to drastically increase our electricity bills. I guess I’m ok with that if it means less coal."
 
"Oh shut up. If you wanna see real climate denialism look at the federal government. Or Queensland Labor. Don't start bitching about governments actually taking action ""too late"""
