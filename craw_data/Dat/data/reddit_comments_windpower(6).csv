"Yeah it'll be great This project had been awaiting planning approval for like two years under the previous coalition government, thankfully labor ticked off on it quickly as Victoria has been awaiting this project for awhile now. There are 3 other planned windfarms right next to this too so that whole area around the gippsland offshore oil rigs will be full of turbines, right near the latrobe valley transmissions lines too"
"Would be amazing to see. This is not a pro/non post, just wow on the scale."
"De-carbonizing the economy isn't everyone run out buy a new Tesla you're done, although a lot of people seem to think this. It's massive construction, mining and engineering."
"The entire bit from 730 is pretty shitty. It's hard not to see this going down a similar path to onshore wind and amplifying a couple of anti-groups and forlorn shots of the coastline and eerie turbine music bodes less well. They're really cool projects so I hope this isn't the case, and hopefully the necessity is apparent. I briefly (and informally) spoke to an impacted council and it sounded like they didn't want a bar of it. Aligning governance hey."
We need to build these projects. Let's hope they work especially with our coal fired power generators all slated to be shut down...
"Am I the only one that thinks an ocean full of massive wind turbines would be awe inspiring? Like don't get me wrong, the ocean by itself is beautiful, but just like a massive skyscraper its nice to marvel at human advancement and what we are capable of sometimes."
We see turbines in the distance at my parents' rural property and they're honestly quite beautiful.
They are awe inspiring when seen anywhere. The footprint they use of the sea area is relatively nothing too.
"Those things are such an eyesore. Wind farms are too unsightly for my liking, because of what they do to the landscape"
but think of the birds getting cancer.. or something
And think of view! Who will protect the view? /s - (just in case)
And the point of this dramatic bit of crap from 7.30 is that wind turbines are really BIG and you will be able to see them from the beach... BIG Fucking deal!!!
"We've actually got pretty good green energy production most of the problem comes from network stability and energy storage. Cool project though, right place to put them."
Was that island in Wilson’s Prom
Yep.
"They are massive. If I'm not mistaken, the guy in the movie Tenet actually lives in one for a short period. Of course, that one was in Europe. For some reason, I got the impression it was one of the British ones."
They are massive. Yeah - I'm pretty sure the larger ones for offshore are 150 or so metres tall... That's fucking massive - and why they're not anywhere near that height on land...
"But, but, but I was told that they would be eyesores - Papa Murdoch never steered me wrong before"
The main ecological effect will be found with the construction of massive deep sea cabling systems required to deliver the power back to land. It's not just floaty boys
"that area of water is very shallow (in the grand scheme of things) and is why the water in between vic and tasmania is so dangerous, it is shallow and has a whole sea trying to squeeze through the gap. And one of the vic/tas powercables runs right along where this project will be, which is why it was located here."
Awsome
Will never work. They'll blow the boats off course <jk>
But we have so much land that’s dry and barren. Shouldn’t Solar be better? Save the coastlines and all that..
"So, when are we going to talk about the environmental impacts of this “green energy”. When are we going to talk about the mining involved. Or the fact that the blades aren’t recycled. Or the amount of oil they use to run. Im all for alternate energy, but not when we are robbing Peter to pay Paul. It might be alternate, but it’s not green."
All of the things you listed still don't come anywhere close to being as bad for the environment as non-green energy production. Wind power is objectively better for the emvironment than gas and coal.
 
"Wind turbine syndrome is pseudoscientific nonsense. Its promotion in Australia is linked to the AstroTurf organisation the Waubra Foundation, a non-profit that is directly linked to the IPA and the Liberal Party. If you believe that wind turbine syndrome actually exists, you have unfortunately been had. It is not real."
"Those headaches seem to go away when they get a cash settlement. The people promoting it dont seem too concerned about the respitory conditions exhibited by people living near coal mines, or the effects on groundwater caused by fracking."

"Some will hit the turbines unfortunately, but the overall benefit to the planet will be a huge plus for bird populations in the long term"
Fish food
yeah I'm sure they'd be much happier with choking coal smog
    
"That's just not true. Transmission losses explicitly make it better to put generation near consumption. Yeah, the interconnected grid is great, and the new funding into the Tasmania link to help them hit their goal of 200% renewable energy is awesome, you still want generation to be close. Offshore is good in that it requires far less social license. It's not going through anyone's farm, or house, so approvals are far easier. Also capacity factors are higher offshore. Now personally, I don't think we need offshore in Victoria, onshore would be enough if social license was easy, but it's not."

You’ll need to go out of your way to see them. IIRC they’ll sit over the horizon. Aesthetics are irrelevant to this discussion.

Wait till you hear about the running costs of nuclear.
This says not much for maintenance of offshore turbines… http://drømstørre.dk/wp-content/wind/miller/windpower%20web/en/tour/econ/oandm.htm Of course we’ve seen the costs of maintenance of coal fired power stations here in Vic and the Callide power station in Queensland.
