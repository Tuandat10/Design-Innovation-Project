This is the real winner out of the budget. Local manufacturing is what we need to become a gold star economy.
Having a secondary sector is very important but it is mindblowing to me considering how insanely rich Australia's primary sector is that none of that wealth goes to improve the living of australians.
It's not easy to kickstart a manufacturing industry. This is going to require a lot of investment over a long period. 
"The thing is, if manufacturing is going to be done here, you can can bet there will be a heavy push towards automation and robotics. There is no other way Au can realistically compete without that advantage"
"It’s a nice idea on paper but going to be interesting to see what it looks like in practice. For a lot of stuff it’s going to be hard to make a case for why it should be done here rather than one of our neighbours where all the costs are lower. Places like Germany show that it’s possible by trading on things like quality and history, it’s just going to be tricky to get from here to there."
Bring back the Trana!
Trana-led industrial renewal. The future looks bright.
"Why must this stuff always be framed in the most inflammatory way possible. It should be about improving our industry, not dickmeasuring with China."
"Because many rich and important people want a war, that's why."
Excited to see the coordination with US and EU tax incentives for Australian critical mineral export and the development of hydrogen production for carbon free ammonia.
"I’m currently in China and puzzled by Australia’s fixation on trying to compete with China in manufacturing. How can a small country with a minuscule technically skilled workforce hope to compete with a country that has a massive low cost workforce that has a high education level in STEM. Not to mention overheads, unions, environmental standards … it just doesn’t add up. There’s nothing inherently special or noble about manufacturing - income from resources, tourism, education and other services looks just the same on the bank balance sheet"
"I too don't understand. Most countries that have manufacturing based economies are actually less well off than us, often by quite a bit. Why are we chasing after manufacturing, when its mostly done by countries poorer and of lower living standards than our own. Even developed manufacturing countries aren't exactly doing amazing, people aren't generally singing the praises of Japan and Germany."
"We need to develop one industry to a very high standard, imo it should be prefabricated housing made from plantation grown softwoods with integrated water storage, solar, battery, air con and composting toilets. Really high design standards for domestic use and export."
"Solar, battery and aircon, that's a whole lot of industry isn't it? "
"It's good, but probably 10 years too late. It's going to be very, very, very difficult to compete now. Hopefully some things get up off the ground"
"Its going to be hard to compete as a nation of people who want the highest wage for doing the least amount of work, whilst also wanting to wfh and have flexible hours."
"Investing into manufacturing? Really?! That's ... Bizarre. And that's putting aside the fact that a big portion is for essentially gambling on speculative technologies ... Amidst a cost of living crisis, too ... The truth is that Australia is a high-cost country. It's high-cost in several ways: In terms of taxation & regulation, in terms of employment costs (in turn due to high cost of living), and in terms of the geographics - logistics is difficult when you're on the other side of the planet, and your cities are rather spread out. However, that's relatively fine for high margin industries. Pharmaceutical research, computing tech, etc. It's not fine for manufacturing where you're competing against the world to manufacture something (and everything is easily copied) and margins are therefore thin. And even if we turn around and say 'well, it's for domestic consumption, we don't need to compete' - You still need to take into account opportunity costs. Why do something inefficient just because we can ignore that it's inefficient, when we can do something better with our dollars? PS: Investing in critical mineral production makes sense, that's safeguarding oneself from a china monopoly. Green hydrogen is stupid though, as it's a terrible storage mechanism for electrical power."
You don't need to be an autarky but having zero manufacturing exposes you to plenty of supply risks e.g. what happens if shipping is disrupted or if your favorite exporter decides to launch a war?
Won't work. We live in a hyper-capitalist society. People want cheap goods. Especially in the current cost of living crisis. Look at how much foreign furniture Harvey Norman sells vs Aussie made to get an idea how this will play out. Too little. Too late.
I am forced to want cheap goods because the cost of living increases especially in the last few years have demanded that I have to.
Hahaha yeah that will work ...
Expertise or high tech industry is way too far for australia. How about digging the dirt up cause it sounds ways more practical.
More like Mad in Australia. It's the fucking car industry all over again. AUKUS handouts + stage 3 + this = Australia's great fiscal disappearing act.

"There is plenty of talent in Australia, they just move overseas because half the jobs are taken up by foreigners who will work for cheap. I work in IT and well over 50% of the people I have worked with in my career are immigrants, and I'm not just talking low level IT support staff or entry level developers. I mean in almost every single role. I have sometimes been in scenarios where it's even higher, close to 80 or 90% of my team(s). There are so many incredibly talented Australians, but most just move away because opportunities are better in the US. Then look at things like Science. You basically have to move overseas to do anything good. Pretty much any STEM field is fucked for Aussies."

"Comparative advantage is how we ended up with economic complexity next to Uganda's. We have a brittle economy which rises and falls with commodity prices.  A sensible thing to do would be to try to smooth that out with other things. Given how much mining we do, perhaps we could make mining equipment. Or have a software industry to make agricultural management easier. And then, those could be tradeables that improve the national income.  The idea that just because we have a comparative advantage in one area means we're forever consigned to doing it is idiotic. Especially as mineral resources are  finite. "
