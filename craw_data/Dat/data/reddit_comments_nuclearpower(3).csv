Because it is easier than doing actual research when writing a news article
"For a long time, people in Australia equated nuclear power with atomic bombs. When my ship arrived there for a Brisbane port visit in 1983, a Greenpeace protest erupted. Thats so stupid since nuclear power is environmentally friendly."
It’s always been amazing to me how similar the US and Australia can be sometimes.
"In my opinion it's hard to take the coalition policy that seriously as it took them so long to land on it, and took zero action in the neatly 10 years they were in power, the party is still packed full of climate deniers, who heavily promoted new coal generation and only once they realised that it was becoming politically untenable switched to promoting a ""gas lead recovery""."
"Dutton is deliberately making nuclear look bad because he wants coal, since nuclear and coal people are huge enemies. Now, there's a massive anti-nuclear scare campaign in Australia, so fuck him to hell. If he was genuine, he would be promoting nuclear with renewables, not using nuclear as a smokescreen to restore coal."
"I’ve been following this for a while. I think the debate is not really that “retro”. The anti-nuclear talking points have moved on the real steelman argument about time and cost of building nuclear. But the talking points are terribly misinformed by CSIRO Gencost and Lazard LCOE, which mischaracterize nuclear by cherry picking reactor designs and builds, and they don’t use the accurate discount rate or cost of capital that a government-financed nuclear program would have. Renewables advocates don’t seem to have a grasp of just how much storage CSIRO Gencost calls for in the 100% VRE scenario. It does seem to ruffle a lot of feathers from monied interests that have invested heavily in renewable resources. Their investments are at risk if the government builds nuclear plants. Competing resources impact their ROI. I think this is the biggest driving force behind the meltdown that people are having on Twitter."
"I feel like the cost thing is pretty stupid, politicians actually have to gasp spend money and not just line their pockets as everyone else suffers? The horror."
The weird thing is that Australia have the largest known uranium reserves in the world. Could best Kazakhstan at uranium mining if they wanted
"There is one country with a huge vested interest in the energy economy who absolutely does not want to see western nations embracing nuclear energy: Russia. The anti-nuclear movement are likely being fed narratives and are helped with organization from Russia, because Western nuclear energy will completely void their geopolitical position as a supplier of petro energy. This might be one of the reasons for the narratives being so sticky. They are copy-paste lobby tactics applied across all western environmentalist groups, likely infiltrated and receiving funding from Russian intelligence groups."
"American here, not sure how much it matters, but iirc they've got huge uranium mining operations there, and make some level of bank by selling to the US. No idea how that influences local lobbying/politics, or even how lobbying or other corporate attempts to turn cash into control works in the Down Under. But its probably enough money that someone's trying something. Doesn't mean they're succeeding though."
Main concerns for most Australians is the cost and timeline of developing a Nuclear industry from scratch and how this may negatively impact our cost of power therefore cost of living while we are waiting for Nuclear. What does not help is that the LNP political party is not providing any details at all and they are known to be run by the mining industry. Gina Rhinehart is their puppet master.
I would imagine the best way to do it would be to work with a Korean or Japanese company. They seem to be able to build them faster and cheaper than anyone else
UAE built the Barakah plant in about the same time South Australia has been building wind/solar/storage. Barakah on its own could decarbonize South Australia twice over. Last week SA burned a ton of gas. https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=30m&view=discrete-time
"Nuclear is only a 'debate' in Australia at the moment because the opposition are pulling it out as a pseudo policy to pro-long the big polluting coal-fired power stations. If they were ever serious about nuclear they would have pursued it during their nearly decade in power. If they win the next election I can almost guarantee we won't see movement on nuclear power in Australia. Australia has massive amounts of land and coastline for wind and solar, and not a lot of people or heavy industry. In-short, it's essentially the perfect country to build an all, or near-all, renewable grid. The advantages of nuclear being low-waste and low-land usage are barely advantages here, while some of the cons such as requiring a skilled workforce, long build times and being politically unpopular are exacerbated by the fact we don't have an existing industry as you mentioned."
"Valid points, but I’m pretty sure the sun sets over all of Australia. ;-) What we have is two fans of sports teams screaming at each other with zero depth or nuance. The renewables mob want their free pony, and pointing out the stabling costs results in a huge amount of either lying or a delusional temper tantrum. The level of discourse is unlikely to improve."
You should hear the Austrian nuclear debate
"Nuclear is highly unlikely to ever happen in Australia, the Conservatives are disingenuously promoting something that will almost certainly not happen, as a smokescreen to drag out the dominance of coal. Based on that, the opponents of nuclear feel free to ‘play dirty’ as such. There is an attack ad in the works that will be a photomontage of Hiroshima, Windscale, Maralinga, Chernobyl, Fukushima, radiation burns etc, sad music, a good soundbite or two, with the voiceover done by in the same style as this ad: https://youtu.be/OJ9f378T49E?si=ozNLepica8WUA8wt Australia is the absolute unchallenged god of fear based attack advertising. Nuclear hasn’t got a chance against that with a population who is largely scientifically illiterate, let alone understands that nuclear is statistically extraordinarily safe. The cost debate aside, the emotional/fear debate will strangle it at birth."
"As an Australian if we hand an nuclear industry all ready I would be all for having a nuclear power plants but unfortunately we don’t have any supporting industry or infrastructure in place atm I’m looking at form a cost perspective and the amount of money we would have to spend to get a plan live would be ~$90b Australian and may end up been much higher due to cost blowouts. For $1.5m we can install 1mw of solar power or $3m for 1mw of wind power cost wise it does make sense for a virgin market (no nuclear industry apart from a research reactor (Lucas Hights open pool) used for medical research) And Australia is only looking at 1000mw of generating power, and there has been no details provided on what designs would be used to build out plants or where we would be storing the spent fuel. If the plan was more comprehensive and detailed where it going what design where we are sourcing the fuel and where we and sending the spent fuel I would be more than happy to vote for it. I would rather be informed then just blindly following them."
"atm I’m looking at form a cost perspective and the amount of money we would have to spend to get a plan live would be ~$90b Australian and may end up been much higher due to cost blowouts. A few months ago I did a quick back of the envelope calculation of how much it would cost to replace all of Australia's coal production with nuclear power. The number I got was AUD 155 bn, assuming it was built by the South Koreans for the same cost as their export project in the United Arab Emirates. https://old.reddit.com/r/nuclear/comments/16luu1s/australias_energy_minister_says_replacing/k1597al/"
The UAE went from zero nuclear industry to building the Barakah nuclear plant in about the same amount of time that South Australia has been building wind/solar/storage. Barakah provides over 2x the power that all of South Australia consumes. SA still hasn’t fully decarbonized. https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=30m&view=discrete-time
"I’ve seen this debate go on for over 20 years. This is popcorn worthy as a common argument utilised is “it will take 10-15 years to establish, so why bother”. Only somebody with enormous political capital and leadership could make this happen for the next generation. Perhaps then I can put the popcorn down. The debate is ideological, binary and at times toxic. The reality is, we can have renewables and nuclear."
