why not take a look.. these silly limited lifespan solar panels funding the economy in China isnt the answer either. get of your high horse it looks like Thorium reactors are viable
"Thorium reactors are cool, but are they cheaper than options available in Aus now?"
How does Nuclear power make sense anywhere?
"Because different countries have access to different amounts of wind, solar and hydro, and may already have established nuclear sectors, so the economics of different sources of electricity work out differently."
Did I miss something in the article? The nexus between nuclear and climate change denial doesn't seem to be particularly strong.
It's less outright denial and more about delay. Nuclear energy in Australia would take at least 15-20 years to make happen. Many advocates of nuclear energy want it to roll out in place of renewable energy. Pausing renewable energy roll-out for 15-20 years means 15-20 more years of fossil fuel based electricity generation.
"Not sure why this is a public debate when the average aussie is a complete and utter crayon eating moron. This isnt a debate for the public, let the experts do their thing and allow karen from facebook to seethe at the outcome"
Staright fax no printer
"Haha totally agree. Dutton is trying hard to make it a public debate, but seems to have backfired."
Can we just stop talking about this. There's like a post every day on nuclear for the past 2 months. It's so tedious repeating the same arguments and everyone knows it's just a LNP strategy to wedge Labor and delay renewables. They had a decade in power and did nothing. If you think this is serious policy you're an idiot.
"It sure feels like a genuine discussion being led by real interest from real everyday Australians doesnt it, obviously 100% legitimate and organic posting thats for sure"
"And I shall once more say it again, LNP’s ‘support’ for nuclear has been a disaster for nuclear proponents in Australia. Many people are pro-nuclear and anti-LNP, and were before LNP decided to pretend it changed its mind. You can’t just shove off nuclear enthusiasm by saying LNP had a decade of power and didn’t do anything, because the people who care about nuclear don’t care about LNP’s opinion, they want to change Labor’s and the Greens’."
"The Coalition made no progress towards a nuclear power industry during its nine years in government. Its vociferous backing for a nuclear industry has only emerged since it has been in opposition. This tactic nevertheless seems to be bearing fruit, in political terms at least. A recent Guardian Essential Poll found more people thought renewables were more expensive than nuclear, when most objective reports suggest nuclear is at least three times more expensive than renewables. This is how poisoned the debate is. Conservatives have been running a FUD campaign against renewables for decades and people are swallowing it up despite all evidence to the contrary"
Yes with the backing of Murdoch and the Costello network (aka ch9) the average punter has now swallowed this up hook line and sinker. Hopefully we wont have to hear more of this tripe after the bext election if the coal alition lose an Dutton gets the ass
Dutton with his jokes about water lapping at island peoples' feet due to global warming and then initiating a cynical campaign to thwart urgent action on a global crisis just for politics. He's probably reasoned that if it wasn't him doing the evil thing it would be the next Liberal stooge that takes his place.
"""Delaying renewables also feeds into the culture wars. Suggestions that the last election could mark the end of the climate wars have proven premature, to say the least."" ""The latest shift – from small modular reactors to large-scale nuclear – came after the cancellation in November of the NuScale project in Idaho. This, the only small modular reactor approved in the US, was terminated before construction began after it became increasingly clear the power produced would be too expensive."""
A diversionary tactic is all it is. The Coalition opposition have no politicise and no ideas and just raise the nuclear option to draw attention away from climate change actions
The beef industry is one of the largest contributors to global warming but if you mention this you end up like Sister Dorothy One cow drinks 80-100 litres of fresh water a day. One quarter pounder takes 2500 litres of fresh water to produce the beef and Australia export 70% of its beef production. The number one reason for clearing of the Amazon jungle is for beef production. With big players like Gina Rinehart in the business I can see no one is talking. https://www.ginarinehart.com.au/60th-australian-export-awards-winner-2gr-wagyu-from-aussie-paddocks-to-plates-across-the-planet/
"If it makes no sense, then why not just make it legal and let market forces demonstrate that."
"Why not both? Can a renewable only future sustain Australia? Who knows, but it is always good to have the option of a stable energy source that scales quickly with growing populations. I am not against either but you only have to see the evidence of Germany's failure in transitioning to renewables after they shut down their power plants, only to go back to coal after they cut ties with Russian gas. Whether you like it or not, oil isn't going to disappear overnight, hell, it probably won't even completely cease in this century. Yet the anti nuclear misinformation spread by oil and gas lobbies is worrying."
Why not both Biblical amounts of money. Edit - it really is unfathomable how much nuclear would cost us. Truly. Just the cleanup of Ranger is blowing past 3 Billion dollars. Just one mine.
"Can a renewable only future sustain Australia? Who knows, the CSIRO. they say yes."
"Quite simply because it’s very expensive and difficult to build nuclear reactors. They are constantly going over budget. They only get built now (around the world) when the government builds them or when there are considerable subsidies. This is because of the huge capital costs (and the big risks of capital overruns when not building the exact same model for the 5th time; which is what happens when you upgrade the tech involved to a new more modern reactor type). In Australia. Before a nuclear reactor is even built, an entire suite of technicians and engineers have to be built out of nothing. An entire regulator has be spun up with similar expertise to watch the industry and ensure it’s safe, then you have to create an educational program to reproduce those experts. After that the Australian government and whatever private actors bribed into doing it will have to construct one of the most difficult engineered projects without any personal experience. This all has to be solved by paying hundreds of foreign experts a lot of money to spend years overseeing it all. When it’s done. You have a well of expertise that quickly dissipates (unless you constantly build new reactors and plants). If you’re going to replace the same reactor in 50 years, it’s not far off from starting again contractor experience wise. This is the issue stalking countries like the US and the UK (wherein new reactors are financial disasters). So if you’re willing to put down billions and billions of dollars and a sustained government campaign with imported experts and new government agencies; why not get much better bang for your buck with renewable energy and energy storage? How will it be built in time meet the zero carbon goals anyway? How long will it take to do the policy planning, the training and institution building, the contract writing and negotiations with foreigners, the set up time to get hundred of people in place? 10 years? You know how long the average modern nuclear plant takes to build from the first concrete pour? 20 years. This would mean pursuing an ‘intern’ energy strategy, likely gas. Which economically means replacing coal with gas and then timing nuclear to replace it in 30-50 years (depending on how much of the capital costs of the gas plants you want to waste)."
"I am not against either but you only have to see the evidence of Germany's failure in transitioning to renewables after they shut down their power plants, only to go back to coal after they cut ties with Russian gas. Germany hasn't necessarily gone back to coal, but rather it has phased out nuclear before it has coal. Nuclear power has largely been replaced by renewables, and coal (as of Feb this year) is at a 60 year low. Reference: https://theconversation.com/why-germany-ditched-nuclear-before-coal-and-why-it-wont-go-back-228212"
"Why not both? Because it's so expensive, and also very slow to build. but it is always good to have the option of a stable energy source that scales quickly with growing populations. Nuclear is stable but it doesn't scale quickly at all. Can a renewable only future sustain Australia? The short answer is ""most likely yes"" but that's really not the right question to be asking right now. The right question we need to be asking is: What can we be building right now to replace our existing coal generators, since most of them are scheduled for retirement in the next 10-ish years? New coal or gas generators would be absolutely unthinkable, given the requirement for decarbonisation. Nuclear isn't a real option, since there is absolutely no chance we could have a single nuclear reactor in place before the major coal power stations are shut down. So the only logical solution is renewables and storage. It's relatively quick to build and scale up as required. Costs for solar, wind and batteries are all plummeting. The fact is that we really do not have a lot of options. Nuclear being presented as a genuine alternative is a furphy."
"there is no path to nuclear without renewables, our coal plants are on their last legs and nuclear will take too long to spin up without a bridging plan"
"Having both would be nice, but we don't have infinite capital or time. Developing a nuclear industry is cost prohibitive, while you can use the same money to build energy infra now. The recent csiro report looked at the economics and made this point, from memory. Edit: see https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/articles/2023/december/nuclear-explainer"
It would be a different story maybe if we already had a fleet running. A huge amount of the sunk cost would be there. But apart from the plants themselves we have to set up all the supporting industry and labor and regulatory framework. You are talking 20 years minimum and if you got everything setup and more than 2 nuclear plants with much change out of $100B I would be surprised.
"it is always good to have the option of a stable energy source that scales quickly with growing populations The problem with nuclear fission reactors is that they require a prodigious amount of cool fresh water to keep things cool and Australia does not have a prodigious amount of cool fresh water to spare. France has double the average rainfall of Australia yet they have had to put their nuclear reactors into idle mode due to a lack of cool fresh water. How are we supposed to handle it? Worse yet is that we are supposed to be due for more mega-droughts like the one we saw at the beginning of this century. On the other hand, we have vast areas of Australia ideal for solar power where the population density can be measured in square kilometres per person and thousands of sites that have been identified as being suitable for pumped hydro - if we built out all of those pumped hydro sites we would have enough storage for over 2 years worth of electricity usage for the whole of Australia."
The fact that the libs did nothing when in power is a bit of stretch coming from Dutton. The real answer should be why not lift the ban on nuclear? Alot more people have died from every other form of energy production including coal mining and renewables. Why not legalise it and leave it to the market rather then the government and invest in R and D for cheap Renewables.
"Sure, leave it to the market. Investment will be zero in Australia. Which nuclear plants been commissioned in the last 20 years without billions in gov subsidies? USA is backing away from the SMR golden goose already. I'm curious and would love to know if you have examples."
"because it isn't just a matter of legalising it. Because of safety, international treaties and other red tape the amount of legislation would be huge."
"It's useful for everyone to ""debate"" nuclear while in reality progress on renewables will be slower and harder than we all would like. Labor needs a strawman to beat up, the Libs need something to fill their policy hole, the media gets clicks and for some reason I find it cathartic to rage against it."
Meanwhile California is shutting down its last reactor in a couple years. The rest of the world is moving on. Time to go nuclear was 20 years ago.
The same California that has rolling blockouts and urges its citizens to limit their energy during the peak summer period. Yeah probably not the best example of 'moving on'.
the rest of the world is moving on You sure about that buddy?
Countries have doubled investment in nuclear post the Ukraine war. 
Diablo Canyon just got a life extension.
Isn't California also importing a crap tonne of electricity from neighbouring states at certain times of day? Most of which is coal based... (I.e green on paper only because they only count what they produce and not what they import) There still isn't a viable non-fossil fuel baseload / backup power source that isn't nuclear. Hydro is limitited in scale and the resources needed to roll out batteries with current tech is monumental (exceeds supply).
Yup. We totally missed it!
   
It sounds like you might have just picked a couple of bad examples. This study shows that onshore wind is taking on average 4.5 years from planning to completion and solar taking 3.5 years. https://iceds.anu.edu.au/news-events/news/renewable-projects-are-getting-built-faster-%E2%80%93-there%E2%80%99s-even-more-need-speed
"Nuclear isn't illegal because it would have long approval times. You're confusing the rationale for nuclear being illegal with the rationale for why we shouldn't invest in nuclear power. If you realise wind farms have long approval times, what makes you think nuclear, which doesn't even have a regulator would be quicker?"
"I really don't understand this argument that nuclear is ""too slow""? It's purely an economic argument and goes to explain why the required private investment just isn't forthcoming for Nuclear. It's considered a high risk (different government could quash the whole thing due to NIMBY pressure), with massive setup costs and a payback time needing 40-50 years. All the time you are having to compete against other forms of generation some of which have seen significant cost drops in both setup and operation costs over the last 10-20 years, which if continues on a similar trajectory increases the ROI risk. Some of the projects are not projected to be finished until the 2040s but it isn't illegal. The reason why Nuclear power is current illegal in Australia is associated with our signing of the Nuclear Non-proliferation treaty. In a lot of cases the countries that do have strong domestic nuclear power generation capabilities also have Nuclear weapons."
I didn't know the federal government enact legislation to make infrastructure development illegal if construction takes too long. How did I miss that?!
it is one of many arguments against nuclear. Why are you trying to take it out of context?
"I want what your smoking. Who's estimates? For what nuclear. In which country. Quote me here. From the very second a party decides to proceed with nuclear it will take (if it makes it at all) at least 20 and likely closer to 30 years. I'll eat my boots if it's quicker. So no. Not <10 years. The time-frames are decades, and what do we do in the mean time.. IF it was 10 years. Most people wouldn't put this up as an argument."

"why not use nuke power Mostly because its expensive compared to our other sources of power generation, and we don't have any domestic expertise, and have a long history of screwing up builds that take decades."
"Because the nuke subs we’re supposedly going to get a decade or three hence will come with sealed reactors. Australia will not fuel or refuel them. So there is no link, zero, between having nuclear powered subs and having/needing nuclear power plants onshore."
"We don't yet use nuke subs, and the entire reason we went with them is because THEY DO NOT NEED TO REFUELLED AND HENCE DO NOT REQUIRE THE OPERATING NATION TO ACTUALLY BE EXPERTS IN NUCLEAR POWER. At least try and stitch together a logical argument please? If only for a laugh?"
"More like...We are planning to some day get nuclear subs (2040s), why can't we have nuclear power now? Aukus seems pretty flaky, but I take your point. A civilian nuclear program is illegal based on legislation from the 90s."
