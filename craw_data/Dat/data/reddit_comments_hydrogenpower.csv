"I understood the hydrogen economy in Australia would be that the huge excess renewables in Australia will produce hydrogen and then ship it to Asia. I have a better idea. Instead of using excess renewables to send energy to Asia, use the excess renewables to desalinate sea water, pump the sea water up through canals and then use that fresh water to irrigate cropland in places that are great for growing but have water issues. Then export the food to Asia. China is the largest importer of food in the world. Australia is a very large area that could use irrigation to make it a much larger food producer than it already is."
If this were feasible it would have already been done long ago.
"if you think pouring water onto rocks gives you fertile farmland, then you've either been playing too much minecraft or dwarf fortress."
"Or use that energy for benefaction of minerals mined domestically, sell steel instead of iron ore. Lithium is another possible beneficiary"
The cheese is under the sauce
"Good idea. Similar to what the author proposed in that energy should be used to produce higher value goods for export rather than trying to export energy in the form of hydrogen. “The question is what to do with that extra energy capacity.” Griffith says the answer to that question is to become a world leader in electrifying the primary production of materials from ores, and doing so with renewables. “We have a superpower opportunity well suited to Australia’s natural resource advantages – metal ores and low cost energy. “Steel sells for roughly 10 times the price of iron ore. As a simple example, today we earn around $78 billion in revenue from iron ore exports. If we refined that and exported it as steel, it could make up to $707 billion in revenue,” the submission says “This version of an Australian bauxite industry would be earning $48 billion in exports, three times as much as today’s $16 billion,” Griffith says, although he adds that to do this will require an enormous amount of renewable electricity. “This highlights the importance of boosting our renewable energy production to assume the status of a world superpower,” he says. “That’s really the fundamental argument …up-processing these things in Australia to, maybe not finished stainless steel but at least into pig iron, or into a highly concentrated lithium brine, is absolutely how we should export our energy. “So use the renewables here to do that. We may not make the cars for America but we will make the steel and aluminium and lithium,” Griffith told the Committee."
"Superpower makes me think of the idea of transferring energy around the globe. That idea is never going to work. Given their isolation, and amount of unoccupied land, solar might be a better bet."
I hate the fucking amount of conflicting statements about hydrogen. Every other post is about how hydrogen either is the way or is not the way. Fuck you.
I hate the fucking amount of conflicting statements about hydrogen. Every other post is about how hydrogen either is the way or is not the way. Fuck you. Hydrogen spammers post hydrogen stuff constantly and block anyone critical so they can't respond. It used to be the entire subreddit was swamped with hydrogen propaganda. As a result a counter jerk has formed.
"Or, you know, use that green hydrogen to make green ammonia locally and export that. Even OP admits that ammonia is a legitimate application for hydrogen: Use of hydrogen for any ground transportation is dubious. That's already obvious for cars and buses but trucks and trains will follow the same path, for the same reasons. Steel is likely one of the legitimate applications hydrogen will be needed for. Also ammonia fertilizer. But hey, no surprise that this hit piece of an article totally overlooks the legitimate applications. The longer it takes for green hydrogen to become affordable, the longer that oil and gas can keep their monopoly on hydrogen applications. Just saying."
„steel & fertilizer“ sometimes sounds like a niche application but it stands for 10% of global CO2 emissions worldwide road transport is another 12%
Did you even read the article? The article is precisely talking about making steel and exporting it instead of exporting hydrogen.
There's already proposals to make iron with electricity directly.
"It certainly could be, but it's unclear if it will be. I think it's still unclear to what extent the economics of hydrogen can be improved and it's also unclear what other methods of long-distance transportation and long-term storage of energy generated by renewable sources are going to be clearly better overall."
"There's more to hydrogen than just the energy applications. What I mean by that is that hydrogen can be used as a chemical feedstock in the production of other chemicals. The overwhelming majority of hydrogen that is conventionally produced is used as a feedstock rather than as a fuel. The most notable application is in the production of ammonia as this is the biggest application of hydrogen where it does make sense to witch the supply of hydrogen from dirty to green. Another candidate is methanol. Right now, the biggest consumer of hydrogen is oil refining but refining oil with green hydrogen seems pretty foolish. Another major application of hydrogen, as a chemical feedstock, is in the conversion of iron ore to Direct Reduced Iron, which can then be fed into electric arc furnaces to make steel. In this particular case, green hydrogen would replace coking coal in its role as the reducing agent. These facts are often omitted in discussions about hydrogen, which really is misleading on how green hydrogen can legitimately help with decarbonization. Why omit such crucial pieces of the puzzle?"
