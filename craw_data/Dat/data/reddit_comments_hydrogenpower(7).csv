"I'll start with a throat-clearing so I am not accused of being a nay-sayer or a hater of hydrogen. I'm an electrical power engineer, clean energy accredited designer, and have more than a passing interest in the stuff. We absolutely 100% need green hydrogen.... BUT... Hydrogen hopium is strong but the physics aren't as enthusiastic as the fossil fuel industry backers of it. Without a doubt green hydrogen has a part to play in a zero emission future, but in my estimations it's future will be limited to using it as a molecule and NOT an energy source or fuel. Green Steel may fit into the former. What I mean by that is we will need green hydrogen to replace the approximately 100 million tons of fossil-derived hydrogen that we currently use in the world, for things like making ammonia for fertiliser, and syngas etc. We absolutely must displace these with green hydrogen but it doesn't account for a huge amount of the world's overall emissions so we need to focus on the big pieces of low hanging fruit first, as we have finite resources, finite money, and not much time to keep kicking the can. Hydrogen is NOT a source of energy. It is a STORE of energy. So you have to make hydrogen from something. You can either reform methane (natural gas) using steam (""black"" or ""blue"" hydrogen), or you can use renewable electricity and water to make ""green"" hydrogen. You can burn the hydrogen for heat energy, or you can run it through a fuel cell to turn it back into electricity. The latter being the most commonly pushed technology. This is an awfully inefficient process. You have to convert electricity into hydrogen gas, compress it to a liquid, transport it, store it, then turn it back into electricity. You lose around two-thirds of the original energy context of the renewable electricity. Its also expensive. As a practical example, what this means is a Tesla 3 BEV is 3 to 4 times more energy efficient, and costs around 5 times less to ""fuel"" per km, than a Toyota Mirai HFCV. This approximate benchmark applies to most other applications where people are pushing green hydrogen as a solution to green energy. If we use hydrogen fuel cells instead of batteries, we will need to generate THREE TIMES as much renewable electricity. This is not small beans. Look at who is backing most of the big hydrogen projects worldwide. Its largely fossil fuel companies. If they were doing it with their own capital I wouldn't care, but they're all seeking public money to do it. Forgive me for being cynical, but it seems like one big bait & switch scheme - sell us the sizzle of green hydrogen, but actually sell us black or blue hydrogen. If it looks like a duck... TLDR: we need to directly electrify whatever we can as quickly as we can, and at the same time building out our grid with solar, wind & hydro. I would say nuclear but I don't think we have time and it's too expensive. But I remain open to the possibility. We need green hydrogen but we need it to replace the existing dirty hydrogen. Much of the hype of hydrogen is vapourware."
"Appreciate your thorough reply mate, plenty of food for thought"
Very sensible take. What about shipping? Ships will definitely need hydrogen to decarbonise?
"TLDR; Twiggy has the capital and knowledge/experience to deliver on this, IMHO if you wanted to place a bet on this (I wouldn't, I'm more broad based ETF dork) then Twiggy would be the safest bet -----Steel and Green Steel----- Steel can be done 2 ways, elec arc furnace (used to recycle) or blast furnace (used with iron ore) 50% of the worlds steel is made in china, most steel in US is recycled not new steel, china is really where new steel is made Hydrogen would be replacing the Blast Furnace which currently uses coal Hydrogen furnaces already exist for other purposes, big steel makers have already made multiple ""We did it!"" announcements but it's like saying ""We did it!"" in regards to building an EV....it's all known technology, of course you could do it, its an achievement and a step forward but we are not waiting for a ""Break-through"", of course you can build a hydrogen furnace for steel making So the whole thing comes down to the cost of hydrogen. -----Hydrogen----- Cheap Green Hydrogen is a waste by-product of renewable energy Sun/Wind doesn't always shine/blow all the time so you need to oversize your system so that on average when it runs at 70% capacity, it's still able to meet 100% of your energy needs Then when it is really windy and sunny and your filling all your storage as fast as you can (Pumpd hydro, batteries, whatever) then the excess gets dumped into electrolysis to split water. The resulting hydrogen is basically free (What else you gonna do with the excess? really, what else could you reasonably do on demand at any time?) Hydrogen is useful as you can; A) Store it for winter energy B) Combine it with nitrogen (Air is mostly nitrogen) = Ammonia Ammonia is an industrial feedstock for many profitable things like making fertiliser, bombs, etc We already handle, store, process large amounts of ammonia, it's fairly stable, can be liquified and transported easily, procedures, policies already exist, CSIRO came up with cool membrane which if you push Ammonia through splits it back into Hydrogen and Nitrogen Ammonia is cool C) Use the Hydrogen in other Industrial process, namely Steel making  Hydrogen is a waste by-product of renewable energy. Long run it's a winner, short term there are cart before horse difficulties but we are already so late that we should probably just push ahead anyway"
I appreciate the TLDR at the top of the post. I would like more to follow this. Sound arguments too
"Have a look at the work that Anglo American is doing with green hydrogen. Disclaimer, I work for this business - but the legwork they are doing on building hydrogen into the mining value chain is without parallel. They have an operational 220 tonne hydrogen haul truck at a time when manufacturers are only just starting to sign MOUs with mining companies; a pilot solar-hydrogen plant; plans for the first full fleet conversion by 2026, and an objective for conversion of their entire haul truck base. https://youtu.be/s1BUjfbluiY"
The hype and emotive narrative they are hyping is a turn off.
A bit like a cult leader drawing people in?
From a technical perspective we can make green hydrogen and then green steel. From that perspective its solved. The problem is scaling and costs. It simply takes more energy and effort compared to the normal method. If/when steel emissions are regulated only then green steel will become viable. The way I see it is that Twiggy is preparing for this eventuality. So once it's economically viable he's got a head start on everyone. But don't buy into FMG purely from that. The vast vast majority of the company is still iron ore mining.
It comes with massive government subsidies. So he makes a shit-tonne of money regardless of the outcome.
"Yes IMO but it’s a matter of timing. Long term green hydrogen is just printing money but it will probably take a while to get there. With all the climate change regulations coming into place then bankers can start realistically investing in these projects so hopefully it will be sooner (3-5 years) rather than later (5-10 years). My personal opinion only, DYOR"
"Long term it’s also a commodity, so it’s not going to generate sustainable super sized profits. Sure, there will be good times and less good times but they’ll be dictated by supply and demand rather than anything that’s defensible. No doubt there is opportunity to make money as an investor, but BYO thesis… know why you’re in, know why you’ll sell, stick to it and don’t succumb to hubris."
I am hopeful it works if only for the benefit of the environment impact
I invested in the company as I like what I am hearing and a pivot towards a new business area. It may not work but I am taking the punt on it.
Buy them for the fantastic steel/iron ore producer that they are. They produce it cheaper than anyone else. The green hydrogen side of this could be good for the future but it’s not the sole reason I invested in them.
They talk about the green side of the business being FFI fortescue future investment Will this company get spun off as a seperate business in the future away from FMG ?
I was wondering that as well Unless the steel mill will be FMG? As per the metals group name vs mining group??
Twiggy is a business man and everything he is doing is to grow his pockets knowing that he has more buy power than a lot of others looking to enter the market
"I think its easier for him to foray into the area on the back of billions for dollars in personal wealth gained from the burning of fossil fuels to extract a non renewable resource from the ground. Without new legislation I can see very few projects being feasable, maybe the primo hydro sites."
