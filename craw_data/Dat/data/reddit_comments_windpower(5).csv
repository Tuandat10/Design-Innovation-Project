That's a fantastic article! I resonate with the author on many points and I roo dream of the illawarra becoming an Australian super power in industry. This is just one step on the way to getting us there. I thought his idea of some of the profit coming back to community was a very good very valid one. That extra funding could fix roads and schools and hospitals that are all screaming for attention in our area. Through things like grants and rebates it could help inject money into public spaces like crown St mall or shellharbour village or sporting facilities or parks and beaches and make this a far nicer place to live. I'm so excited about this project and I really hope it gets up.

Wind turbines are beautiful.
I actually love looking at them tbh
"Brilliant article, should be shared as much as possible to counter the blinkered centre right media landscape prevalent in Australia. To me it's a no brainer. Create a brighter future for my kids and the region. As for the visual aesthetics of wind farms we look at coal ships all day, wind farms would be less of a blight in my opinion. (:"

"This wind farm proposal is absolutely highlighting the low IQ of most of those who call the Illawarra home, greed in the form of property value woes and greenies who really think their google search about whales gives them a strong opinion. Wonder if people worry about sea life being killed from any number of goods that they buy that are shipped into this country."
Saul is a friggin national treasure

Whats powering wind turbines just wind or coal ðŸ¤”
Not quite sure what to think of this cryptic comment.
If they would just let us have nuclear the country would be fine
A great big nuclear plant in Bulli is just the thing the area needs.
"So Saul posts a blog supporting the wind turbines, what a surprise! He has to show support for this so his electrify 2515 project gets subsidies from the government. Just a bit of casual quid pro quo. Apart from how horrible they will look a large concern of mine is the whales. Saul barely discusses it in his article, maybe his avid environmentalist mother (he mentioned her in the blog) has views on the whale impact? I guess we will have to wait for the EIS conducted by one of the wind turbine companies that will make billions of dollars from the project going ahead.. then we will know for sure that whale impact will be minimal."
If the whales can make it from Antarctica to the tropics Iâ€™m pretty sure they can swim around a few poles.

Should have rounded up you and your brainless NIMBY mates while you were all in one spot and deported you. NIMBYs - I don't want them in my backyard!
Your community sucks. Go move to Coober Pedy and stick your head in a hole with the other people keeping this country in the dark ages.
