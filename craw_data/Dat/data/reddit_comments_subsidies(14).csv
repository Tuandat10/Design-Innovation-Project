And the diesel fuel rebate for farmers?
The person with the least credibility on energy issues opens his mouth and surprise....
I'm surprised he got the words out past his foot
Australia to kill off Craig Kelly political aspirations
That's the guy the Russians paid off isn't it?
That would be the one yes
....personally I think Australia must kill off the coalition party
I seriously don't know how there arseholes can sleep at night.
"How about we just make it more open. If people want to install 5kW of Coal Generation on their houses, give them the same rebate as for 5kW of solar. Just make it based on self generation of power, don't make it based on the type of production. I am pretty sure you wont see a lot of people rushing to install coal generators in their back yards."
Craig Kelly is a cunt
Correctamundo!
What a dreg.
What about coal subsidies?
Can we have GetUp campaign against this guy?
"I don't think the SRES should be scrapped but the rooftop solar industry needs a shakeup. As it stands installers normally claim the STC rebate on your behalf, on a 5kw system this will normally be worth 3-4k. The trouble is there are so many dodgy installers around (I'm looking at you sunboost) that use shitty gear, do a shitty insulation that these systems have a high failure rate within 5 years. But phoenix companies are rife in the solar industry (they go bust and then create a new solar company to avoid warranties and liabilities) and home owners are often required to replace solar panels to fix their system.  The catch is the STC rebate is issued again for the 2nd install of panels, now we all pay for that in our powerbills because it's energy providers that have to purchase these RECS and this is passed on to all consumers via their energy bill. I don't think we all should be paying higher power prices because of a poorly regulated industry."
We should be phasing out/ramping down the generation subsidies and replacing them with storage subsidies. (Which I'm sure is not what Craig Kelly wants.)

Says the person who is funded by the mining industry?

"I understand your point, but that's a terrible example. Cigarettes have been proven beyond the shadow of a doubt to be bad for your health. The extra tax on them offsets the medical harm they do that much be paid for. Solar panels (last I checked) don't give you cancer, gangrene, or any other diseases. They give you a clean energy source."
