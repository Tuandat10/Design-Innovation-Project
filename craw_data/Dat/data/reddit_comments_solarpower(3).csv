Absolutely yes.
"OP keep in mind YMMV for example; I use a tiny amount of energy, and none during the day, so it wouldn't be worth it for me due to terrible FIT, but if you use lots of energy during the day its a huge benefit."
"For us, yes. Wife and I both WFH… PCs and tech online all day, our power bills are very low. We did train ourselves a bit also. Minimum usage at night (our house is full LED lights) dish and clothes washing with full sun (max capacity on solar)"
We (2 adults and 1 baby) are $150 in credit for this quarter thanks to our solar.
"If your plans include owning an EV, you want solar - and as big as you can get. Think summer days... EV chewing 7 kW (11 kW if you have 3 phase), AC another 4 kW or so, you're running the laundry and/or dishwasher for another couple of kW... You don't wanna be paying retail rates for that kinda consumption."
"Yes. My system paid for itself in less than 4 years, and it lasts 20+. It's a no brainer, if you can cop the initial cost. Those free systems that you pay back, the interest and cost you'd have to double check."
It's been worth it for over a decade. Catch up dude.
"Solar is worth it. That case for batteries is a lot more iffy. Just be careful not to fall for FUD to make you overpay (fear uncertainty and doubt): it’s an investment not a hobby, and ultimately you’re protected by the same consumer laws and all electricians are licensed regardless of how much your system costs."
"With 10.4KW of panels and a 9.6KWH battery, our house has been 98% self-sufficient since October, which should move to 100% easily once the air conditioning goes off in the cooler months. Even with the awful state of the feed in tariff, it's more than offsetting the daily service charge, as well as the tiny amount of purchased energy we need when the battery runs dry overnight. I don't expect a power bill for a very long time. A 14k investment has made us about $120/mo better off which has certainly helped cash flow."
"Unless you are a quite low usage house, it's not hard to get a pretty good payback period for a small system, but the economics get a little more challenging if you are trying to get 100% on solar."
"Money wise; Mine paid itself off in 3.8 years and the panels themselves have a 25 year warranty. So ~21 years of profit. Inverter has 10 year warranty, but will hopefully last longer than that. Feed in was better when I bought, at current math it would take 7 years to pay off and start being net positive. Green Energy wise;
Yes, Solar have a net positive affect for power generated vs power to construct. By a long shot."
"Depends on your usage. Not worth it for me as our house is energy efficient and our quarterly bill is less than $100. If you have a pool, A/C, or electric hot water it is probably worth considering solar. Batteries definitely aren't worth it at the moment though."
"That's about 300kWh, an impressively low usage."
What’s your gas bill ? I assume you must have gas hot water and cooking?
I pay zero electricity and gas from the credits. winning!
"If you have air-conditioning, yes. You don't want to get too much solar because the feed-in tariff is tiny, but if you're using power yourself during the day in summer with air-conditioning, doing laundry, charging an electric car, etc. then solar will save you a lot."
"Absolutely yes. We were in credit the first 6 months in our new place with solar, and even during the summer, running AC all the time our bill has been incredibly low."
I use most of my electricity at night. I don't have a battery. The last bill I got for the last quarter was over $400. With solar feed in it dropped to just over $300. I was using aircon a lot. Best I've got since I installed in 2019 was a bill of $8. FIT suck right now because more people are getting solar and the electricity companies are losing out. But still very much worth it. Use https://www.solarquotes.com.au/ Really good website and doesn't cost a thing other than providing a review post purchase. I went with Yuma Energy (middle of my 3 quotes) and had nothing but good things from them from install to 4 years later still keeping an eye on my system. Batteries are still not worth it personal preference.
Yes
When we had solar (we’re renting) in our previous place the electricity bills were about $100/qtr. in our new place we have no solar and the bills are around $400/qtr. absolutely worth it.
Just get someone reputable to install and quote. Many big companies sub contract the installation to small time electricians which is fine most of the time. My install has not gone well with major roof leaks still not fixed. There is not much support once they have your money.
Which major company and sub contractor did you use if you don't mind me asking
I think you have $ and cents mixed up. Should be $ 0.05 and $ 0.3?
"We have a 4 bedroom house with pool. 10kw of solar panels means we tend to yield 8.5kw max when sun is good. Total yield for a decent day is over 50kw. If you can get away with only running hot water system during the day and/or have a pool running most of the day, I think it’s worth it."
We have the same size system and run the ducted AC along with pool washing machine and dishwasher. On good days we pay zero $$$.
"48 panels, totalling 9.125kW, on a 10kW Aurora inverter, and we haven't had a power bill since turning it on 13 years ago. Family of 5 that runs air-conditioning from 1st October to 1st-15th April (just over 6 months) every year. Lounge air-conditioning runs 24 hours a day, it is never turned off during this period. I will add batteries and more panels (the inverter can handle 11.1kW) when the 44c tariff is withdrawn in 2028."
"I have solar and I don’t regret it but feel super ripped off by the tariffs, and I still have to pay just to be connected to the grid. My electricity bill is usually around $50 - $75 per month depending on night time usage of air con, but $40 of that is service fees to AGL so I’m not sure who these people are with hundreds in credit! To be fair I have the smallest possible system because I’m sharing a roof with five other units So YMMV"
"Ultimately, unless you’re changing energy companies regularly, you’ll end up getting paid 5c per kWh, which doesn’t amount to much off your bill. Try and use as much as you can during the day like running the dishwasher and hot water system on a timer. Even if you’re getting more than 5c per kWh, the return on investment takes a long time. And if you factor in the cost of getting them cleaned/checked every couple of years, takes even longer."
Our quarterly power bill just came in at $220 down 400 from last year.
Were there any government rebates not associated with solar though? My last bill had a government cost of living rebate.
It is IF you are not planning on moving house in the next 3-5 years. I’m not sure if it’s worth getting a battery still or not but last time I looked into that a few years ago it was not worth it since the return on investment for a battery system was 10 years which is the lifespan of the battery itself. Things may have improved since then but today it’s definitely worth getting solar panels and an inverter installed. Cram as many panels onto your relevant roof space as u can. Once installed you’ll need to change your habits a bit to run everything during the daytime and as little as possible by night to optimise your investment. Since we now get so little back for selling to the grid (circa 5c/kwh) I’d advocate improving your quality of life by running heating/cooling as much as possible by day to capture heat/cold in the house (depending on season) instead of giving the power at a steal to the retailer to sell to someone else at 5-7 times the price they paid you for it.
9kw system about 1.5 years old. Haven’t paid for electricity since I put it in. Saved $2700 so far. If this continues I’ll be on track to pay itself off in another 3-4 years.
"8 years of solar and going great. Our bills have been vastly reduced, we export about double the power we use. We are waiting for the price of batteries to go down and we'll upgrade and further reduce bills, probably to zero or earning money back. I also want to be self sufficient when there is a power outage, keep the fridge going, power for our tank water pressure pump, lights, internet (via Starlink)......"
Depending on state. There is a battery booster program with decent rebates. $3k approx helps a lot.
Cost me 12000 in 2009. Got a few grants and rebates so all up about 9000. 44c lifetime rebate. Everyone I know laughed at me and said waste of money. Haven’t had a bill in 15 years. With a pool. Who’s laughing now assholes??
"There are heaps of calculators out there to help you quantify the number of years to break even on the initial cost of the system. We spent a fair bit on the panels as well as batteries. Our neighnbour is like us - basically live in air conditioning 24/7 in summer. Her monthly electricity bill without solar is about $600-$700. Ours is about $250. I expect that once air conditioning season is finished, we probably wouldn't have much power bills to pay - at least that's what we are hoping! ;)"
"Our power bill for last quarter was $36, AC going all the time during summer too. The quarter before that we were in credit $18. Very worth it."
"Haven’t had a bill yet. Gas hot water and cooktop. We have high star appliances that heat their own water and that helps too. So does the grandfathered tariff we have until 2027, but we are careful with usage. We’ve gotten close to getting a bill a few times with a few of these heatwaves as my partner and I both work hybrid, so good so far though."
I slowly saved and put solar over half my roof. I barley have to think about power bills anymore.
Yes. I paid $7000 for our system (no battery) and our power bills have gone from 1500-2000/quarter down to <$200 each quarter since.
For sure. We pay almost nothing in power bills.
"We found it to be - electricity bills + solar panel loan payments are hundreds lower per quarter compared to prior to solar install. Use AC a lot more than prior as well. We wash clothes and use the dryer during the day, hot water system configured for a bit in the morning and main heating from noon to 6pm. Electric car is on the horizon this year I think."
"Look up the solar quotes website, lots of good info there."
"Depends on your circumstances. We have solar but no battery. I am retired, so we run the dishwasher, washing machine and clothes dryer (when we use it) during the sunny part of the day. Pool filter and hot water system and heated towel rails are on timers to run during the day. Run aircons mainly during the hot part of the day, but sometimes at night. Sell what we don’t use back, and buy electricity at night. The last two quarters have been in credit. Prior to that about $2 per day. 10 years ago before we had solar, we were paying about $12 per day."
"100% yes. It is a pretty simple calculation, and most solar mobs can provide somewhat realistic estimates of how much power you will generate. They often simplify it though. The ROI for solar for me was 2 years. I haven't ""paid for"" a energy bill since August."
"Hell yes - Solar is worth the investment. Your power bill will simply vanish, no doubt."
"My Power usage was always around $100 a month, got solar and it dropped to 0, now with the higher costs per kWh, the $1.4 a day charge for having power and the crippled feed in Tarif and ‘you have solar so here’s an extra fee’ my bills are back to $50-75 a month But I know they’d be more if I didn’t have it It helps long term as long as the power companies don’t overprice us into oblivion"
"As others have said, if you use a decent amount of power during the day it is totally worth it. Timer on your hot water can help, and if you WFH even part time, or have small kids at home with a stay at home parent, it is a no brainer, if you can afford the up front cost. The feed in tariffs are terrible, mine have gone down from 14c to 7c/kwh since I installed my system in 2020, you have to use the power you are generating for it to be worth it. My 7kwh system saves me ~$1000 per year."
My parents bill is very low but it depends on your use case. If you are home during the day and do all the heavy appliance tasks while the sun is out you will save a fortune. If you are not home during the sunny hours and do all your heavy electricity tasks at night it wont help at all unless you get a battery.
I have 14 x 490W solar panels on the roof. My bill dropped from $300 a month to $50 a month. Even if I run the aircon 24/7. I live alone.
"For our family of 3, 100% worth it, if we had batteries we would almost never need to buy power, Over summer our bills went from around $650 (last year before price increases) to $140, we are pretty conscious of using power intense things during daylight hours, but also have never ran the AC more over summer. We pretty much ran the AC all day for free when it was the hottest part of the year, at the rate we are going it should have paid for itself in around 4 years. I wish we did it sooner."
Yes. Mine will have paid for itself in 3/4 years
"yeap, its worth it, my folks got solar a few years ago and only took 2 years to pay it off and now they are in the plus with credit and they run a pool off it. i wish i could get it so i can run my aircon but i rent so no fucking chance in hell for me. stupid renters will be the only people to supply energy companies with actual money, while the rest of the country gets free power"
"It is, especially if you can get the qld government rebate for battery storage at the same time. https://www.energyandclimate.qld.gov.au/about/initiatives/battery-booster-program"
"There are lower interest rate (not LOW, just LOWER lol) loans available for solar installation - then your cost of power becomes the cost of finance. You are no longer at the mercy of the market. Depending on where you live, that may be a good option"
"Qld government at the moment is offering 3-4k discount off batteries, but you have to jump through some hoops to get it. But it takes the 10k cost down 7k which makes it a little more palatable. https://www.qld.gov.au/housing/home-modifications-energy-savings/battery-booster-program"
"We looked into the economics and it wasn't viable for our situation. We use 7kWh per day of electricity on average, gas cooking and instantaneous hot water (about $25/month in LPG). Rarely home during the day where the only real load is the fridge/freezer. The biggest thing we did to save energy was insulation."
"Depends on your usage and site, but almost certainly. Retail price increased about 20% last year and is predicted to do the same in the year ahead. I got solar and battery about 18 months ago, haven't had a bill since and was paid $1200 by ergon after 12 months for sale of excess power back to them. Ergon feed in tarrif is 13.4c/kwh, which is better than some others."
We went with Yuma Energy and it was so worth it about a year ago! They explained everything in detail about why solar would benefit us. One of their consultants even went through our quotes from other companies and helped us understand them more. We were skeptical about solar at first but they really broke everything down and made us feel super confident. Our bills have been basically nonexistent since.



Maybe. But here's one of the drawbacks... https://youtu.be/77rYL5OHFdE?si=eK5GnIzjsrrzI1oC
"Yes for us definatley , four adults constantly on computers or watching movies . Three of them do not know how to turn the lights of . Ihave been in credit since we installed solar."
Just wait until something fails out of warranty and any gains you have made will be spent on repairs plus more. Solar is still not economically viable long term. I have done the sums many times and the cheap crap they are installing is not worth it long term unless you plan on not replacing upon failure.
"You have to do some research and find the reputable components. I think the best indicator is the flashier the ad on tv, the more likely they are using crap and fly by night brands."
"The reality is systems double in efficiency and halve in cost every 5 years. Now you can get a 11.7kw system installed for 8k. Everyone uses the same gear (with exception to micro inverters). In 10 years you will want to replace the current systems anyway, and will definitely do it in 15."
"Every kilowatt you use from solar is a kilowatt you don't have to pay the power company for. We are a high energy use house (Pool, Pool Heater, Ducted aircon, big fuckoff 90cm oven, WFH, EV) It's much nicer to buy 10kwh day from the power company than 50kwh."
"Panels alone, no but whole system panels and battery and set up correctly yes"
