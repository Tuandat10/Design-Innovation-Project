‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried nothing and we‚Äôre all out of ideas‚Äù The Coalition is a blight on this country
That's not true. They did scrap the emission trading scheme..
Their plan for the climate is the same as the economy. Keep the train running full steam ahead. Even though we know the train is going to crash into a mountain if we don't slow down or switch tracks
Is anyone surprised?
"Dutton is THE WORST person to lead the coalition, leader by default is a joke. They need someone leading them and not just some old head entrenched, I'm centre right and I would never vote for the coalition. and the nationals, don't get me started, Like hick crack head alcoholics bitching that they want a bunch of stuff but ""not in my backyard"" . The government we have is good for now. The less of both evils."
"If at first you can't succeed, don't try again - Australian Liberals."
"""we lost the last election because everyone was sick of our lack of action on climate change. And to prove we listen we're doubling down"""
"While it doesn‚Äôt make it right, practically none of the countries that have signed on to Paris are actually meeting their targets."
"‚ÄúEveryone wants to achieve Net Zero‚Äù Qantas posts record profits. The two are incompatible. Only 10pc of people willingly pay more for their flights to offset their CO2 production meaning 90pc of people don‚Äôt. If you truly believe in global warming and net zero, then all flying must stop. There is no way to fly to LAX or Paris or London without producing CO2. There will never be an electric plane that can do this due to the energy density of jet fuel vs weight of batteries. People say they believe in climate change and net zero, but no one is willing to make personal sacrifices for it. The targets are a joke."
There's a lot of low hanging fruit before you get to not flying. Convincing people they can walk for ten minutes instead of driving for two minutes and spend eight minutes looking for a parking space would be a start.
This is absolutely the path to be on if he wants to lose the election. After the hottest summer on record he just sounds like an absolute F-ing moron with this take.
Elsewhere: Peter Dutton accused of trying to ‚Äòrip up‚Äô Australia‚Äôs commitment to Paris climate agreement Dutton to pull Australia out of Paris Agreement if elected
It's almost as if they didn't bother trying and now want to give up anyway.
How they were continuously re elected baffles me It will take decades to undo their damage ü§Ø
"Except that he‚Äôs correct. The 2030 target is 82% renewables generation in 2030, so 5.5 years away. In 2022 it was 32%. NSW is currently having to beg a coal power station to stay online until 2027. I don‚Äôt think we can do it if we wanted to and if we try we really will completely trash the economy. If anyone else thinks otherwise then would be good to see the basis of it. The government target is just not realistic."
"As opposed to Labor retaining the targets and simply not meeting them. I simply can not take any ""climate activist"" seriously that is not invested in the advancement and use of nuclear energy."
"Their nuclear power plant can't be built before 2040, so no real surprise they have to give up already."
"Getting rid of the Paris Agreement sounds pretty good, since that means no more additional taxes on just about bloody everything from food production to enegey production."
Good...it's all just silly carry on to appease the virtue signalling hysterics.
"Thank God common sense can prevail against the net zero crazies who have been calling for zero fossil fuels by 2030. Crazy thinking makes for crazy policies. Thank you, thank you."
Sounds good to me
"Well that's what you get when you vote for a minority government.
If you vote for the liberals the only way they can form government is with the nationals and the nationals don't want anything other than coal power.
Or as they put it: We need to meet the challenges of a changing climate in a sensible way that protects our natural environment and sustainability but doesn‚Äôt throw out our way of life, local jobs and industries."
It‚Äôs been long enough that no one can tell them apart
I'm so sick of ineffective politicians.
Good. It's a hoax
Give the CSIRO 2 billion dollars and let them actually figure it out with open source products.
"Governments and oppositions are incredibly lazy these days. Apparently they think all they need to do is issue a decree and the people/business will sort out the details. 43% emmissions reduction by 2030! Also if you wanna open a coal mine or import a RAM truck I know a guy. We're gonna build 1.2m homes! How? I dunno, you guys figure it out, and build them too. Do your fuckin jobs, you clowns. If we don't meet targets you've set, that means you haven't thought it out properly."
"Paul Keating said it best way back in the 90‚Äôs: ‚ÄúMaybe later, but not today.‚Äù That‚Äôs how the Federal Coalition works now. No ideas, but against those who have them."
It‚Äôs like the Trump Bully Boy tactics. It attracts a certain base that makes the feel comfortable.
Reddit is just one big lefty echo chamber
Well that‚Äôs a winning election ideas
The Liberal party seems to have become a parody of an evil political party without being self-aware enough to realise it.
"The problem with general public's perception of climate targets is that people don't understand the finer details as to why many of these targets can't be achieved. While renewables are considered to be the fastest way to achieve these targets, most people don't realise the following: the time it takes to plan and build transmission systems hasn't improved with the increase in renewable projects. There are completed renewable plants in Australia that were completed more than 2 years ago and are still waiting to be connected to high voltage distribution networks. This is probably one argument in favour of Nuclear, in that there would need to be little additional transmission to replace current coal plants. even if you can replace the electricity generated by coal with renewables, you still need to build 2.5 to 3 times as much electricity generation capacity to account for the shift from hydrocarbons as a fuel source to electricity. This, in turn, increases the requirement for additional transmission even more. renewables currently can't provide all of the Ancillary Services that Baseload plants already provide. You need hydroelectric storage or gas plants to meet that need. globally, there is likely not enough copper to meet the increased demand in the metal due to renewables. For example, a 100 MVA battery bank will typically use 21 transformers (20 x 5 MVA and 1 x 100 MVA) for distribution. A single unit of a coal fired power station would require half to three quarters the number of transformers. On top of this, the entire electricity network will require upgrades due to the increased demand, amongst other applications. In the last 15 years, the amount of new copper reserves that were discovered were about 5% of the total discovered since 1990, in spite of several times more capital investment. In addition, the total amount discovered over those 15 years was close to the total amount discovered in 1991 alone! Either you accept that some of the electricity capacity is going to need to be Nuclear to meet these targets, or no targets are going to be met."
"It's not just copper, it's basically 10 different minerals that have to increase by double or tripple digit percentages in the span of less than 10 years in order to build out the renewable energy we will consume in 20 years considering a new mine takes 10 years to fully develop and we have to build refining capacity to match."
"""Imagine my shock!!"""
"‚ÄòYou tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.‚Äô Homer Simpson. And now, the coalition."
Good
Great news Any alternative to the Climate Hysterics Climate Hysteria bullshit
Election winner Dutton is putting out there.
Then what the fuck is the point of nuclear?
"staple cheaper and longer lasting energy, not needing billions of water for transport of coal and for the station itself, not having to worry about natural disasters like hail taking out solar farms etc."
Meh
To achieve that you'd need to stop everyone from farting ever again
"I give them props for them saying it now, instead of when they‚Äôre potentially elected after lying and saying it would be done."
Weak as piss
Shockingly the liberals are backwards.
"Unachievable.... Yeah, I want to vote in people who are incapable of reaching targets. Look, we could get to zero net emissions if we threw enough money and policy at it. I'm not saying that would be a sensible thing to do. But it is technically possible. It is the governments role to get us to that goal in the least destructive manner. What they mean to say is we can't do it unless we do things we don't want to do, not because it is bad for the interests of our citizens, but because it is bad for the interests of their donors."
"No, you couldn't and keep any sort of QoL comparable to now. It is just nonsense. You want proof of just how bullshit the target is? What is the plan? How can you say that you will achieve a target like that, and at no stage give any suggestion how - and have a bunch of rusted on biased fools cheer you on. But of course, go ahead and make up shit like it is about donors. So go on then, tell us how we are going to achieve the pie in the sky made up figure without a single clue of how to do it?"
We‚Äôve done nothing and we‚Äôre all out of ideas.
That is literally Labor's plan though
Fucking annihilate these clowns at the voting booth.
wait ‚Ä¶ so they are saying their nuclear solution won‚Äôt work?
"I think people do not know the ramifications if the target is not met. The courts will intervene and will make ruling forcing the shutting down of things. I would laugh if they ordered the grounding of all planes in Australia to cut emissions. In Denmark the courts ordered speed limits on highways reduced, the ordered farmers to stop farming. Why do you think there were all those farmer protests in Denmark, leading to the police shooting at a 16 year old boy in a tractor. It is stupid for the government to enshrine these sorts of things in law. Things that are impossible at our level of technology to measure."
"The Coalition is focusing on gas and nuclear power, which the Australian Conservation Foundation describes as a ""fantasy which Australia does not need"". I‚Äôm wary about nuclear, but Is there a plausible alternative to provide zero-emissions baseload power? Or are we genuinely meant to put our faith that solar and wind will work every day and a shit tonne of batteries will power us thru the night? The latter feels like more of a fantasy IMO."
"Finally some common sense. Not all of us have endless money to spend on these pipe dreams. When China stops building coal fired power stations and emitting in one day what we do in a year, will be time to be serious"
"Enjoy those skyrocketing insurance bills, heatstroke every stummer and a billion climate refugees, mate! Short term thinking has fucked us all."
Great
"Unless we invest massively into hydro, solar and wind or nuclear I am not really sure that we can do anything that big in terms of reduction without tanking the economy at which point we will vote out whoever is in. We grew immigration by what - 700,000 in a couple of years - how do you reduce emissions while growing this quickly? What IS missing is any plan or idea because anything other than a slight bullshit level compromise won‚Äôt be accepted anyway."
"Australia makes up 1% of the world's pollution. Trying to cut it in half which would be insanely expensive and obviously hurt the poor the most, to change our world pollution to .5 is fucking insane. I'm all for lowering pollution at a sensible rate as technology improves, brute forcing it is just stupid and nothing but ideologically driven."
Good. The current plan was just to kick the can down the road while the gas and coal get sucked out of our country by the US
Just pull out of Paris alltogether
"This party stands for nothing but big business telling it what to do, if you vote Liberal, you‚Äôre a fool who‚Äôs been tricked into voting against your own interests."
The wank party
Isn‚Äôt it Labor that are ‚Äòhaving a wank‚Äô by pretending their current targets are achievable?
Why can't the UN just force sanctions on countries that refuse to meet targets? Frankly we deserve it.
"You‚Äôd think anyone serious about nuclear would use it to replace coal faster, but they‚Äôd rather use it to avoid renewables - part of why modelling of their plans gets higher emissions even when nuclear doesn‚Äôt emit GHG"
Good. Its ridiculous that we destroy ourselves closing down coal power plants while china open 40 new coal plants per week. 
Big win for Labor
And the likely rise of more teal independents! Let‚Äôs fucking go!
Good. The fuck I am going to curtail my lifestyle to appease some bloody environmentalists.
"What is the predicted effect of Australia meeting that target? I'd say it'd be near nothing even if we suddenly stopped emitting right now, especially compared to China who give 0 fks about reducing their emissions."
Good stuff.
Exactly
I'm ok with this from the coalition. This is them being them.
Yeah well its unachievable when you don't bother trying
We all have to face facts. It's not worth the cost to the ecomeony people invested in coal to save our own lives.
Emissions goals are crap if not all countries are involved
Can we just dump the coalition already
They just lost the next election.

Have voted lib a heap of times but would NEVER vote Dutton
Then enjoy the shit show going forward with paying more and more.
"even if its realistically unachievable, they shouldn't abandon the effort. strive to get as close as possible in minimizing pollutants/emissions."
I think we need to start refusing to elect boomers of any persuasion. Both parties have failed on climate change and they don't have enough skin in the game. They're not going to have to live through the consequences. Time for them to get out of the way if they can't make the necessary hard choices
So if Libs are offering a 30-something candidate in my electorate I should vote for them over Labor/Greens old candidate in my electorate and I'll get better decisions for the environment from the young Liberal candidate?
"Finally a party talking some basic common sense If you want to go back to the stone age and destroy peoples quality of life, never have another overseas trip, prep your wifes boyfriend and eat the bugs, emissions cuts are for you"
if you want to go back to the stone age and destroy peoples quality of life You people are literally going to be sending us back to the stone age.
Sure mate.
Yep its a common sense comback :D
