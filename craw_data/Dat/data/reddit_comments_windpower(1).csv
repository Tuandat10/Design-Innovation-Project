"For $40k a year, they can throw a turbine on my property."
"Nuclear plant would never actually get built, so really it's a choice between nothing being built and a wind farm being built."
Then they would definitely pick nothing because that’s the actual choice they want
"Saw an interview with a country fella who was complaining about the eyesore that wind farms are and how it would ruin the area. When the reported asked him how that was different to the massive, very visible, coal plant down the road he said “because that produces good reliable energy”. These arguments aren’t based on common sense or reality"
Also probably hasn't seen how beautiful wind farms are. Just look at Albany. It's amazing.
"They don't want a windfarm, because that's what skynews tells them."
When the windfarm went up in my parent's community there were people against it because 'they look weird'.
"""Why would the T.V. lie!?!"" - a real quote by my boomer father..."
"And last time around they did not want high speed NBN and voted for rusty copper wires and being stuck in the internet speed dark ages. They admire Joyce riding up the hill in a ute to get internet. While they continue to support politicians wanting to deliver 3rd world infrastructure standards to them. What more can you say, stupidity has no limits."
"I’m in a mining town, with some big wind/solar projects underway nearby. The locals are now blaming the children of the solar/wind workers for a series of break ins. It’s just untrue rubbish they pass around so they have an excuse to hate on renewables, which they perceive as a threat. People here will defend coal no matter how silly their arguments get. I’m not sure they’d even present nuclear as an option."
"Anyone not understanding this article, has not encountered the country folks & their back lash to the proposed Western Green Energy Hub..."
But wouldn't a nuclear reactor also require the transmission lines and associated compulsory acquisitions just like the wind turbines do?
Working in the renewables industry I am currently grappling with objections to a solar farm by neighbours who are furious that they weren't approached by the energy giant to have THEIR land bought and used for solar generation instead. They'll stop the entire enterprise out of jealousy and spite for not being approached first.
"""...& Their back lash to any change they can't directly personally profit off"""
"Nuclear, gas, coal or renewables. You still need Transmission Lines. Get them built before the lights go out."
I'm not sure why a usually clued in news organisation such as The Guardian is covering this as if nuclear is actually going to happen. They should be calling it out for what it is - the LNP throwing confusion in the mix because they want to encourage decision paralysis and prolong the life of the coal industry. They've had decades to build nuclear power stations and they did fuck all. In fact the ban was passed under Howard's watch.
Vapourware station
They wouldn’t. It’s just a way to avoid talking about renewables and keep the status quo.
They want a gas/coal plant several hundred kilometres away...
I want a wind farm :(
"This just in, people don't like change. More at 5."
"These same communities keep people like the beetrooter in Parliament, nuff said!"
"I've attended a talk by the liberal party ""think tank"" on nuclear, because I was at a renewable power conference and they somehow got on the program. I will say, their analysis is quite correct from a technical perspective except for politically, but I'll get back to that later. Its basically all them scamming us to convince a bunch of boomers that when there are power problems it was all Labors fault. Effectively, they point out that nuclear can be built cheapely and economically. The US model of building nuclear with a private industry is not viable. Only a government led organisation with special rules around project long term operation is workable. Let's look at that politically. A new government run large infrastructure entity is not acceptable to the Liberal party. Or they will sell it at a discount as soon as practical. The Labor party are more amenable in a general sense, but are very aware that the last time they did this, the liberals deliberately damaged the project on purpose to avoid giving the Labor party any wins and they hurt the country to do it. For a nuclear plant that's an extremely bad idea. I personally feel if the only way to build a nuclear plant is for both a state and a region (say everyone within 50km of the proposed site) have a plebiscite where they both must agree. Only on dual agreements are all environmental and planning lawsuits on procedural grounds bypassed, since bad faith lawsuits often caused large delays and delays drive around 30-40% of costs. But as I said, the Liberal party would deliberately hurt the project if it was a Labor job and they also would never start it themselves, since they want to privatize everything."
"What's the point though on nuclear, it costs more than double (latest CSIRO study was extremely generous to nuclear as well btw) and won't be built before the coal stations are closed risking blackouts etc. Do we want our economy to be uncompetitive?"
If the nuclear power plants are so safe then put them next to major population centres where the power and resources to maintain them are easier to access If they aren't completely safe and you're mitigating risk by putting them near rural communities then I understand why those communities don't want them near by
"Ok, but then the rural communities don't get to complain about job losses and dying country towns."
"As a non-LNP nuclear proponent, I support this. Wouldn’t even need to be in-in major population centres, just the industrial suburbs, because obviously. I would happily live fence to barbed wire fence with one."
"Past nuclear disasters were caused by old technology and outdated safety standards. Today's plants have automated shut down procedures in the event of failure. As such, yes, I would welcome a nuclear plant close to where I live. It's statistically much safer than living close to a coal plant."
"Remember when they used to build lookout decks and Information for tourist around wind farms. We loved them. Engineering feats! Now sky news has told us that they are bad. People eat it up. Doesn’t help sky news is free in rural Queensland. Used to have to pay for sky, so it must be good right!"
"Liberal politicians: ""We all back Mr Duttons nuclear policies"" Also Liberal politicians: ""We just don't want nuclear power stations built in our electorates"" Anyone seen hide or hair of Duttons nuclear policies? Thought they were supposed to be published before the Labor Budget."
"I am a big fan of the Guardian in general, one of the few sources injecting reality in this debate... But they also lowkey are falling into the same trap as others: Down in Wannon, an electorate that stretches from Anglesea to the South Australian border, the Liberal MP Dan Tehan said Anglesea wouldn’t be hosting nuclear, thanks very much. He said the “Eden project” was designed to rehabilitate the mine site there, which according to its website will “celebrate the local ecology and tell you the story of sustainability”. It's also a hard no cause that plant has been decommissioned for years, and has 150MW nameplate output aka would be a smol baby nuclear power plant aka not worth doing. The only cheap part would be the transmission lines... Which I am going to go ahead and bet is the cheapest part of a fucking nuclear power plant, before the reactor and the turbines and shit (the last two 100% need replacing or else this is legit ""grandfather nuclear power plant""). To chase nuclear there, would officially put Snowy 2.0 to shame as the worst LNP energy project ever attempted. Why is this a thing? I think Dutton brought up Nuclear down there once, and everyone put 2 and 2 together... Without doing a thimble of research into just how dumb the idea was."
I am surprised that this is even a question. Have any of you actually seen a nuclear power station in person and not in video or a book. They are huge and ugly. I worked in Australian power industry and visited a nuclear power station in UK. I visited because of my job but the are awful. Visited a coal fire power station and imagine something much bigger without the coal stockpile. Truly ugly and I helped build coal fire power station. I’m not saying wind-turbines look beautiful just way less ugly.
"Liberals probably want to build them on existing power stations, or in the cities.
Liberals the 'contrary' party: up is down, black is white, thoughtful is kneejerk."
Because they're quieter and take up less space..
Windfarms make sense off shore as it's less populated etc. Scotland has them. There was a suggestion that my local area get some and boy did Facebook kick off. Those community groups were big mad. They want the coal back
"Regional communities, at least where I've lived, don't want any development of any kind. And then they complain about the lack of infrastructure, investment, and people moving to the area. They're called NIMBYs, and they really shouldn't get to dictate the direction of a country."
Because AM radio has been telling them they want nuclear and that solar are what them greenies use and it doesn't work when the sun's not shining. Never mind that you need water for nuclear and that their rates and taxes don't even cover the budget of parks and rec.
The headline is perfectly consistent. Conservatives continuously vote against their best interests.
Jjjooooobbbbssssssssszzzzzzz

Found Peter Dutton’s account on Reddit.

There won't be any view on a dead planet.
"Nuclear needs to be near a significant water source, so it will be coastal… a rural dam that drips to 5% storage in a drought is useless… Still prettier than a coal pit."
lol. I love that. A secluded nuclear power station! What a concept. I suggest that if you travel overseas and visit one like I have. Huge.
