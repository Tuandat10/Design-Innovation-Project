"The whole EV subsidy thing lost me. We've been subsidising Toyota Hilux's and other ""trade"" vehicles for a very long time now, not to mention the fuel rebates (at a cost of about 8 billion per year) to multinational mining companies. Interest free loans for people to put solar panels on their roofs sounds like a pretty good use of taxpayer funds to me."
"The government's EV subsidy program is a complete waste of taxpayer funds that only benefits a small segment of the population. It is not fair or just to ask taxpayers to foot the bill for wealthy individuals who can afford to buy expensive electric vehicles. In contrast, the subsidies for trade vehicles and fuel rebates for mining companies are necessary to support key industries and ensure that they can operate efficiently and effectively. The interest-free loans for solar panels are also a good use of taxpayer funds, as they help to promote clean energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. We need to be responsible stewards of taxpayers' money and ensure that it is being used in a way that benefits all Australians, not just a privileged few."
I agree. Private solar vs utility solar are not quite interchangeable in energy terms; you need both so both are good to subsidize.
"Terrible take, I just used the nsw hot water heat pump scheme. $1200 out of pocket fir a mid tier (bottom tier was $33 out of pocket). Using my energy monitor app I’ve worked out I’ll save $900 a year in electricity for a payback of under 18 months. It’s a no brainer and saves the energy grid and saves me money"
"Hard-working taxpayers are funding all sorts of federal and state concessions for electric vehicles, solar panels and electrification of homes, while the less fortunate struggle to afford their energy bills. Fuck yeah, aggressively emotive language right off the bat (I'm dead certain a fair few taxpayers do not work hard, and some work very hard at not actually paying tax but let's go with it), and then being critical of subsidies for something of a net good (you know, the whole environment and what not) while also ignoring the chief cause of the massive energy bill problem (10 years of govt not actually doing planning or anything much, while coal and gas prices go up despite us being a chief exporter, and said coal and gas plants shutting down or being closed for maintenance). It marks a failure of the political system to sustainably impose a relatively low-cost, economy-wide and efficient carbon price, tax or levy. Gosh I wonder whose fault that is. Naturally, I took the taxpayer-backed deal to buy a new reverse cycle heater and air conditioner, even though I felt it was dudding other ACT ratepayers. I guess congratulations on not sticking to your morals and being upfront about your hypocrisy? Nationally, EVs have become one of the biggest tax breaks for the well-heeled. You mean the things that are so expensive here because there are very few options because other countries sell us their poor efficiency ICE vehicles because of our reputation/emission standards for being behind the ball on climate change? There's more too the article, but it's the same basic theme; Green energy is handouts to well-off people via subsidies, but let's ignore why Green energy solutions are so expensive and out of reach in the first place (and also the why of converting from the current options to Green energy), etc."
"This article is a classic case of the media directing outrage at the middle class when it should be directed at the truly wealthy. Yes, rebates and subsidies depend upon the buyer still being able to afford the product in some capacity, which means people who are well off are better able to take advantage. Most of these rebates and subsidies though at state level have income and home value tests and aren't available to multi millionaires. Lowering the cost of renewable energy for individuals is also a good way to encourage energy independence, where households are unaffected by global energy prices. Imagine a future where the cost of oil skyrockets but most Australian families are unaffected and our economy continues with limited impacts."
It is OK to subsidise rich wealthy people whose opinions we agree with.
"You've hit the nail on the head. Identity, not ideas, are primary."
I take exception to the comment that the federal government developing a road user charge would take too long or not occur at all. Do we forget how quickly the federal government replaced state based fuel excise charges?
"Publication: Australian Financial Review Author: John Kehoe The transition to cleaner energy is becoming a tax break and subsidy gravy train for higher income earners and the wealthy. Hard-working taxpayers are funding all sorts of federal and state concessions for electric vehicles, solar panels and electrification of homes, while the less fortunate struggle to afford their energy bills. The handouts are an extremely expensive way to reduce carbon emissions, as the Productivity Commission highlights. It marks a failure of the political system to sustainably impose a relatively low-cost, economy-wide and efficient carbon price, tax or levy. Instead, resorting to tax breaks and subsidies is very inequitable. People with above-average incomes and wealth who can afford electric vehicles, solar panels, batteries, new heating and cooling systems benefit disproportionately. People who can’t afford these clean-energy technologies will miss out. I recently replaced our family home’s old, ducted, gas-heating system after it blew up. The Australian Capital Territory offered me an extremely generous 10-year, interest free loan of $15,000 to replace the gas heater with an electric system. In today’s dollars the subsidy is worth at least $3300, assuming an average inflation rate of 2.5 per cent. In a high-inflation and rising-interest rate environment, the subsidy is likely worth a lot more than that, compared with a commercial interest rate. Naturally, I took the taxpayer-backed deal to buy a new reverse cycle heater and air conditioner, even though I felt it was dudding other ACT ratepayers. But it seems I’m not the only person financially benefiting from the scheme. The ACT government has hired clean energy financier Brighte to administer the sustainable household scheme. https://imgur.com/a/yvJLvkB Brighte is part-owned by billionaire software entrepreneur and clean energy advocate Mike Cannon-Brookes through his Grok Ventures. The ACT government in partnership with Brighte is offering similar generous deals for rooftop solar panels, household batteries and storage, air conditioners, hot water heat pumps, electric stove tops, electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging and ceiling insulation. It’s not surprising that the forecast loans under the scheme have swelled by 33 per cent to $200 million. The ACT, which easily has the nation’s highest median household income because of ubiquitous, well-paid public servants, has about double the number of electric vehicle sales per capita, the Australian Automobile Association says. Tax breaks for the wealthy Nationally, EVs have become one of the biggest tax breaks for the well-heeled. They benefit from the Commonwealth’s exemption from fringe benefits tax (FBT), cash subsidies from state governments and discounts on stamp duty and registration fees. Exempting low and zero-emission cars from FBT potentially saves buyers as much as $30,000, excluding other state government handouts. It’s a boon for the sales of Tesla founder Elon Musk, the world’s second-richest billionaire on the Forbes rich list. Yet, tax breaks for EVs are an extremely expensive and ineffective way to reduce carbon emissions. The Productivity Commission estimates the cost of carbon dioxide abatement for EVs from the FBT exemption at between $987 and $20,084 a tonne. The cost to taxpayers dwarfs the carbon price paid by heavy emitters of less than $40 a tonne via Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) and the $75 carbon price cap the government has imposed for the carbon safeguard mechanism. The commission notes that supply constraints and delivery delays are already leading to extended wait times for EVs in Australia. “With supply the principal constraint for EV uptake in Australia, policy efforts to increase the demand for EVs, such as tax concessions and rebates for EV purchases, run the risk of simply adding more people to the proverbial queue, subsidising people who are already in the queue, or in the case of tax concessions that are selectively available to some groups, simply pushing those selected groups to the front of the queue – all for no appreciable gain to the overall number of EVs on Australian roads, relative to what would have otherwise been the case,” the commission says. “Using the FBT [fringe benefits tax] system for alternative policy goals like attempting to drive EV uptake risks compromising the degree to which the FBT system protects the integrity of the personal income tax system, potentially reinforcing equity concerns in the process.” Meanwhile, the South Australian Labor government has scrapped a planned road-user charge for EVs, fulfilling a populist election commitment. Again, another tax break for well-heeled EV drivers, while battlers driving petrol-guzzlers pay fuel excise."
"Good Victorian policy Tax economists such as Ken Henry (a strong environmentalist) have for more than a decade advocated road-user charges for all vehicles, embedding the cost of road surface damage, noise, congestion and carbon emissions into the price. Much more sensibly in Victoria, electric vehicle drivers already pay 2.6¢ per kilometre and plug-in hybrid car drivers 2.1¢ per kilometre. But with the $12 billion federal fuel excise revenue in decline, the Commonwealth is inexplicably joining a High Court challenge against Victoria’s EV charge. Victoria is enacting good tax policy (a rare compliment from this writer for Dan Andrews’ government). Road user charges are a more economically growth friendly form of taxation than damaging state taxes such as stamp duties on property sales, insurance taxes and narrow payroll taxes. User charges on drivers could also reduce vertical fiscal imbalance between the federal and state governments. States currently account for about 22 per cent of the nation’s tax revenue but are responsible for about 40 per cent of spending and are highly dependent on financial transfers from the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is interfering by backing Victorian EV driver plaintiffs who argue the charge is an excise, which only the Commonwealth can levy. In theory, the Commonwealth wants to retain the right to impose a federal EV road user charge in the future. But Victoria, with other states such as NSW due to follow, is getting on with the job. It is better to implement the charge now because it will be much more politically difficult in future years. As French statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert famously said in the 1600s, “The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing”. The danger in deferring to the Commonwealth to implement a national road-user charge scheme, is that it will take too long – if it ever develops the political courage – and there will be too many EV drivers resisting by the time it gets its act together."
"Subsidies must always be backed by taxation. I see no problem taxing higher income earners more, then giving everyone subsidies on green alternatives, even if higher income earners are more likely to be making those purchases. As for EVs, subsidising them will eventually build a good second hand EV market (wealthy people are more likely to turn over a car). EVs have a much longer life than ICE vehicles (which become a maintenance burden)."
In this case the 'taxation' is in the form of higher energy prices to fund the subsidies and those who can least afford it are the ones who pay it. This has been know for years and duly ignored because it is a good thing to subsidise some rich people at the expense of the poor.
