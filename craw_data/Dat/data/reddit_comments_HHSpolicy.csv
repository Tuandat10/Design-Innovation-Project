Hydrogen works where batteries are not feasible. Shipping and long thin rail lines come to mind. Aviation will invariably take it on in some Form too.
I read some where that Hydrogen for aviation is a bad idea as it releases water vapour into the upper atmosphere which then acts as a super green house gas.
"There are 2 main elements to energy, electricity and other forms of energy, and each of those is split into domestic and commercial applications. Hydrogen is more associated with commercial applications and is less a renewable energy form, but a store of energy derived from renewable energy sources. But herein lies the dilemma in renewable energy in that its manufacture rate is limited and thus we have to choose whether more of it goes into domestic supply or commercial utilisation. The problem arises if more goes into commercial usage and less into domestic as domestic is largely fed by electricity and that can only be generated by renewable sources or fossil fuel power stations. If we close fossil fuel power stations down asynchronously with demand, there will be blackouts and with less renewable energy allocated to domestic demand, the possibility of blackouts increases; whilst commercial applications will simply continue to use fossil fuels if green hydrogen isn't available, which only impacts on emissions and not their ability to keep operating. Essentially, domestic and commercial demand are competing for a limited quantity of renewable energy production, when domestic demand potentially suffers more from loss of supply than commercial. Green Hydrogen development potentially siphons off more of that renewable demand, leaving less for domestic supply of electricity. The Australian government would do better to invest in more renewable energy on top of investment in green Hydrogen and the best way to do this would be to directly invest in an accelerated implementation of solar panels and batteries on domestic and commercial properties, that can best make use of the energy available and reduce losses by better co-locating generation and consumption, whilst also not requiring additional investment in transmission and distribution systems. It may not be practical to replace domestic gas consumption with hydrogen because of containment issues with existing infrastructure, however, perhaps government could consider development of renewable energy to be used to convert carbon emissions into ""natural"" gas to replace mined natural gas, thus leading to a net zero carbon cycle and not requiring replacement of existing gas energy infrastructure with its attendant energy consumption in the manufacture of replacement electrical infrastructure. It seems a waste to dispose of the energy embodied in existing gas infrastructure merely to replace it with electrical equipment (as it also does in the replacement of ICEV with EV). I think we have to be careful we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater in our eagerness to replace fossil fuel energy with renewable energy."
"Acknowledging that it is a huge infrastructure spend, we should be going straight to domestic electrification. As you note, it is unlikely we can use hydrogen directly for domestic heating and cooking without a similarly large investment in infrastructure, and blending a tiny fraction of hydrogen into our existing natural gas networks isn't going to make much of a difference. More crucially, the pathway Electrical generation → Hydrogen → Domestic heating is very inefficient when compared with using that electrical power directly for cooking or with heat pumps for heating. Hydrogen is not great for grid storage because again, it's really inefficient when compared with pumped hydro (if you have some handy mountains, which we do) or admittedly still immature options such as redox flow batteries. Using the hydrogen to make methane (or ammonia, or methanol, ...) is an option, but still terrible for grid storage and still inefficient for domestic heating. It's going to take a while before we have enough renewable power to be able to afford to waste it at large scale in inefficient pathways."
"however, perhaps government could consider development of renewable energy to be used to convert carbon emissions into ""natural"" gas to replace mined natural gas, thus leading to a net zero carbon cycle Do you mean extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it into CH4? Because my understanding, happy to be corrected though, was that methane naturally ""decomposes"" to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? If you want to extract carbon from the air and convert it to CH4, farming algae and then anaerobic digestion is probably the easiest way to do it"
"Exactly. Hydrogen isn't a fuel, it's a storage medium for energy from other means. And not a good one. It's difficult and expensive to generate, it's difficult and expensive to store and move. All this means that 60-90% of the original energy is lost, making it much more expensive than plain electric power, which only loses 20-30%. And for that reason it's only useful in applications where nothing else will do the job."
