"Power companies kept the profits (rather than investment into storage) from you sending kW to the grid for cheap so they could sell it full price. Now so many are doing it, you've made power plants uneconomical during the day and you have to pay them compensation for breaking their business model. Edit: The compensation is paid like this. Privatizing power is the worst that this country ever did."
Privatizing power is the worst that this country ever did. Fixed it for you.
It’s not power companies doing this - it’s the distribution networks which are regulated monopolies. They’re incurring a lot of expense dealing with the challenge of the high penetration of rooftop pv. So this is a way to find the upgrades and also incentivise people to move their exports to times when they’re actually needed and valuable. 
"Simply put, Australia has a massive energy surplus during the period a few hours either side of midday, due to the amount of solar we have. This sounds great at first, but actually has serious implications for grid stability if the frequency gets too high. The sun tax is a very blunt instrument trying to remedy this problem."
"So if I sign up to a plan that has free power between 10-2, what would stop me from buying a Tesla battery, charge it during the free period and use it to power my house during the peak times of 2-8pm. Would this be better than buying solar panels now?"
There’s a thread on the sub Aus finance of a guy doing this recently. As an electrician it def can work and hopefully more people do it
"“is there a way I can shut off my exports and still use solar” the expensive way is: add a battery to your system and you can fully island when you need to, as well as obviously store power for later use and/or selling into the grid in the evenings for a high price the somewhat less expensive way is: a smart inverter that can tune your exports to be more variable, not just on/off like older inverters do. I would expect that come a year or two after current pilots are done all new PV systems will need this as standard https://www.greentechmedia.com/amp/article/worlds-top-rooftop-solar-market-looks-to-cram-in-more-pv"
 
"Basically they spent 20 tears bullying people to get solar. Used tax payers money to incentive it. Knew this would happen but did nothing about it. Now it's impacting things, taxing the people that did the right thing to pay for their short sightedness. Then allow solar batteries to have high fees to make it not worth while while other countries have them far cheaper. So, those that did right pay more, again. Interesting seeing how some other countries are tackling this, forcing high power usage for industry/manufacturing during those times and shifting working days to allow for it. Quiet a simple, clever, not tax payer funded solution. But Australia doesn't really have that infrastructure or those industries any more too, so again, short sightedness."
"SolarQuotes is a great resource for information like this: https://www.solarquotes.com.au/blog/debunking-sun-tax-mb2941/ TL;DR If I'm reading that right the ""sun tax"" as you call it is taken out of the FiT. So 3.3c FiT, ""sun tax"" of 1.2c == 2.1c FiT. Not ""you pay us 1.2c"". They're just trying to make you more motivated to use your own generated power instead of flooding the grid with it for the sake of grid stability. Being able to curtail exports is inverter dependent. Generally it requires a consumption monitor as the inverter needs to react to your usage, i.e. if your house wants 1kw it limits the output from your PV to 1kw instead of say the 8kw it could currently pump out from the sun."
Why don't the power companies turn off accepting power from solar panels during 10am and 2pm?
Best bet is to buy a 2nd hand Hot water service or two and just head water during th day for 0 net gain to make sure you're not exporting power. Or a few cheapy space heaters.
Yeah but no feed in to offset usage and solar plans are different than non solar plans. So solar users will be def getting raw dogged in their investment
outdoor spa is better
TLDR: seems to complicated to me.
I had a system installed to prevent excess solar returning to the grid. (It consumes the excess) Was actually a requirement before I could get approval to install.
Others have answered already but basically it's this: You generate the most power around midday when the demand is at its lowest compared to supply available. Since they don't have a cheap effective way to store that energy they basically charge you money as an incentive for you to not send them energy then.
"Simple put: Before RET and most renewables power generatated was worth about 4c/kwhr. The governments subsidised solar and have extremely generous perks as high as 44c/kwhr without requiring batteries or any requirement for generation consistency. There is now a surplus of energy in the middle of the day when the sun shines. Not only must all the coal and gas generators spin down, but load must be turned on to burn the power away. The idea of the sun tax is really just to get owners to install gear that will turn off there panels when there is too much excess power."
This is why 100% renewable won’t scale in Australia. The amount of power during mid day when demand is low is actually detrimental to the grid while the power deficit during peak hours when little power is being generated and demand is through the roof just doesn’t cut it. People talk in abstract terms about energy storage but that doesn’t scale. The whole of the Snowy Mountain hydro battery supplies about 2% of the countries needs and the shortfall has to be found somewhere.
Have you heard of batteries. They’re no different to how water tanks work and they’re getting cheaper and better every year. Source - I’m an electrician and work with them regularly
Car batteries V2G fixes this. 20mil cars in oz. massive potential.
"With energy costs going up, and technology advancing, it looks like the endgame is most households and buildings will be self sufficient, therefore the death of many energy companies in the future.
It feels like the energy companies are in a massive last minute cash grab that will fast forward to that future. Everyone I know is wishing to be off the grid as much as possible. Only a small jump in energy storage technology will see a massive jump in people leaving the grid."
"If home, community and community VPP batteries become cheap enough, this will be very interesting to see. What is the tipping point price per kWh with the battery life I wonder? Does it just need to be cheaper than the grid pricing?"
The NEM is broken. The fact that producers sell electricity for spot price is an absolute joke.
Government is losing too much money from EV cars not paying fuel taxes so you have to get it from somewhere!!

Household solar is a net drain and disrupter on the grid. Its good for you and bad for everyone Feeding into the grid is a drain. Astounding.
"Except its not really my network. Im not a service provider. yet every customer is forced to maintain it. Thats what profits are for. Maintain and upgrade your own network. Its good for profits but bad for everyone else Ppl, offices, retail, factories etc use power between 10-2"
  
Except Im not rich. No EV here. 21 year old Toyota
