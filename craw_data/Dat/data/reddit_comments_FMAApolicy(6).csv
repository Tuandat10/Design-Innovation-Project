"Why do we enter into Free Trade Agreements and then undermine them by wasting taxpayer money on what is basically a tariff? This is bad policy on many levels. First, goverments are bad at picking commercial successes. Second, it creates another level of bureaucracy. Third, it is wide open to pork-barreling. Fourth, any time there is free government money all the dodgy operators come out. Fifth, our trading partners might consider it restraint of trade and embargo our more efficient industries' exports. Sixth, it decreases the industries' need to innovate. Finally, once it is set up it is very hard to back out of - take the Australian auto industry as an example. Bob Hawke devoted his career to winding back these type of policies. I am agog that forty years later, we are considering reinstating them."
"It’s refreshing to have a positive policy being put to the country, rather than lazy politics/policy like tax cuts, or constant bad news."
Totally right. Government actually has a fair amount of power that can be directed towards the good of society. We seem to have forgotten that.
"There is something commentators are failing to see about the Future Made in Australia, it’s an optimistic vision of the future. People want optimism and positivity. Since the GFC back in 2008 everything has been pessimistic, i.e. tomorrow will be worse than today, the future is bad etc. Everyone is sick of negativity. Albo is painting an optimistic vision people can be inspired by, one with an Australia that does more than dig things out of the ground. Leaders should create a vision to motivate and inspire people. This is what people respond to. We innately want leaders to lead and we respond when we see it. People want their lives to be better but more importantly want their kids and grandkids lives to be better. Commentators are so unaccustomed to seeing leadership from our leaders that they don’t realise it when they do."

"So pay more taxes, or divert taxes from something else to prop up Aussie-made stuff, like Europe does with farm subsidies making it harder for us. Why not just bring back tariffs if you believe in unfair competition. People can pay more for product whether they like it or not, and the government will make more money instead of spending it. Or just label the solar panels Australian Made and let people decide themselves if they want to pay more for them. There's plenty of stuff we're good at without propping it up."
"Labor's Future Made in Australia policy is good policy. Interestingly, I pitched a similar idea to the Liberal Party some time ago, that it could accept the reality of the energy transition rather than oppose it and look to commercialise it."
