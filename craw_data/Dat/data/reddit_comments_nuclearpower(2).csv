"It took 40 years for them to level some dirt and lay concrete for a runway in Western Sydney, they still haven't started building HSR after 4 decades, we can't even dig a tunnel for the hydro but yeah we're totally going to build 7 nuclear reactors. If there is anyone out there that thinks this isn't complete horse shit, I would like to offer to sell you a magic rock that keeps your house safe from bears."
Can I interest you in an overpriced copper wire NBN service?
I would like to buy your rock sir. I mean it must work since I don’t see any bears around.
30 of the 40 years were probably spent on cigarette breaks and coffee breaks
We're terrible at big infrastructure and see no reason why anything would be different for several nuke power plants.
"At this point, it's not that were against it as a power source, but rather against the bad faith proposals to go nuclear instead of using renewables, which is what a lot of the right wing is trying to do. Nuclear will take a long time to build and implement, and it's expensive and complicated to develop. We can do it, but it won't be ready any time soon. In the meantime, we have a number of different renewable energy resources that we currently use and continue to develop. If there was a plan to develop nuclear energy safely and effectively over the long-term, that didn't also involve a pause or reduction in the use and development or renewable energy sources, then I'd be mostly fine with it."
The best time to build a nuclear power station was 20 years ago
"Nuclear was a great option long ago. Renewables just don't make it really a viable option. They're cheaper, easier to put in, can easily be replaced and are improving all the time. Nuclear would've been great for us in the last century, but it's just not worth it nowadays."
"It’s twice as expensive as the alternatives we have right now, and it would take decades to implement. The LNP are only pushing it so they can fight Labor on something, and to keep coal in the energy market for another 20-30 years."
"It is being used as a wedge by the opposition leader, he is just using it to slow down the progress of renewable energy, in otherwords a diversion. I am almost certain that if Dutton wins the upcoming election, he will just go back to coal and gas, nuclear will just be shelved or something."
Too late and too expensive. Renewables are the way to go now.
Not to mention the immense opportunity cost. Every dollar that gets sunk into this obsolete fever dream is a dollar that won't be spent on renewables. Australia picked renewables. We need to stick to it.
Read this piece. I daresay that the CSIRO know far more than any politician https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-22/nuclear-power-double-the-cost-of-renewables/103868728 It's expensive and it will take forever.
so it will be nbn 2.0? we are best to look further ahead.
"Well you say that, but Nuclear Scientist Peter Dutton doesnt think the report is accurate. And that we really just need to do the research before we make a decision. AEMO? No, sorry they arent accurate either, we should trust the REAL expert in the field Peter Dutton"
If you are interested in getting to zero emissions within the time frame required to prevent greater damage to the climate - it isn’t a good idea. If you are wanting quick solutions to our aging energy infrastructure that we are already having issues with - it’s not a good idea. If you are aware of the impact to its production when the water it uses to cool it down is too warm (like what happens in summer) - it’s not a good idea. If you are wanting the cheapest most cost efficient option - it’s not a good option
"The other thing people seem to also forget is you need a reasonably size workforce with the appropriate skills to run such plants, and we simply do not have that or the means to create one, short of sending hundreds of people overseas to be trained there"
"It probably would've been a good idea 50 years ago, but we've got better options now."
"Airplanes are 100 times safer than cars...but that's because, unlike airplane crashes, car accidents don't end in a nosedive at 500km/h to snuff out 300 lives in a blink of an eye. Yes, each nuclear power generated kilowatt is cheaper and more dependable than anything else, but when things go wrong, they do so catastrophically. And Australia is not exactly renowned for the kind of technological expertise to make this work without budget blowouts or monumental stuff ups. Florence, the tunneling borer for the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project is still solidly stuck in hard rock, without any realistic prospects of successful progress recovery in the near future. If Australia can't do rock splitting well, how good will it be at atom splitting?"
Nuclear is a solution looking for a problem that has already been solved. It is also a very expensive solution that won't get delivered because no one wants to live near the things. If Mr Dutton is serious then he should propose building them in Dickson and other safe Liberal seats.
"Because it’s political bait, timed for the next election. I think we need to look at all energy sources for Australia, and I don’t really object to nuclear being in the mix."
"I'm for it but I don't like how the liberals have proposed it and gone about it. Not to mention if they do keep pushing it we will be at risk as it will be done cheaply poorly and have alot of cost blow-outs. Just look at how the NBN and Snowy 2 was/is being managed now they'll do the same with nuclear power. Not to mention we (tax payers) will front the bill and after its built it will probably be privatised again at our expense. If it was to be done properly, the Australian Defence Force should run it and it's to be never sold off (privatised) and the locations should be pushed further in land. A location for storing waste (old underground defuct metal mine) to be identified and managed."
The fact they are arguing it will be cheaper but have not announced even estimated costings blows my mind. 
Another good comparison is the Victorian desalination plant. Nuclear needs ALOT of water. There is a reason most are built on the coast or large rivers. Australia doesn't really have a lot of good wet inland area that isn't agriculture and it's better to use seawater than irrigation water. Also the more distance the electricity has to travel the greater the cost in distribution networks.
Estimated delivery time if started tomorrow is like 2050. The debate will take 5-10 years before starting. You are now talking 2055-60. If you look at the latest plants in the US they are delivered around 10 years late and they know what they are doing. We need a solution before 2070.
"Bad idea, very expensive, intractable waste, highly technical, difficult and expensive to maintain. There are cheaper option that have far less long term environmental issues."
"If anyone thinks that nuclear power is going to bring power prices down, dm me - I have a bridge in Sydney you may be interested in buying."
Fun fact: Nuclear waste is recyclable.
"I'm not anti-nuclear, I'm anti Liberals. They have cocked up everything else they've been in charge of, or made it so their beneficiaries reap all the rewards, why would nuclear be any different?"
"It’s mind-boggling expensive. Tax payers would foot the bill. Reactors built overseas are always delayed, over-shoot their budget or don’t get finished. We don’t have a nuclear industry to support it. Batteries plus renewables are cheaper everyday."
"Battery tech for energy requirements doesn't exist. As for cost, why are you putting a price on the climate?"
California is trying to get rid of nuclear because it's to expensive.
It's expensive. Cheaper alternatives.
"Because it's too dangerous and the waste is a gigantic, unsolvable problem. Nuclear waste is just as dangerous as any other part of the nuclear fission process. However: it cannot be destroyed it cannot be used for anything it cannot be safely stored All previous storage methods like dumping it in the ocean or in abandoned mines are having to be revised, and in some situations, like this documentary I saw, which was about an abandoned salt mine in Germany, I believe, they're having to spend time, money and resources pulling up the ""stored"" nuclear waste cause it's leaking into the ground. And trying to find some new way of dealing with it. Nuclear isn't worth the downsides. One Chernobyl should have been enough to tell us that. Anyone who says nuclear is safe and problem free is a fuckwit or a liar deliberately trying to mislead you with false information."
"Just saying, more people die from radiation related problems in coal mining than ever have in nuclear."
"In theory, I'm not against nuclear power at all. But there are a couple of reasons I don't support it as an option in the short term we need. That short term being defined by both needing to reduce carbon output and the end of life of existing coal & gas systems. Firstly there is no international capability to produce reactors in bulk or in any form of modular way. Every reactor is designed and built to custom spec. The net outcome of this is that individual power stations are expensive and slow to build. In comparison you can buy off the shelf coal furnaces, boilers and turbines and then just assemble them. If you look at reactors built recently in the western world the time scales of those builds are eye watering. The Vogtle power station is the latest reactor to come online in the US. This was an expansion of an existing plant, so much of the infrastructure was already in place, and yet it took 11 years from the start of construction to commissioning. The second is that we don't have the domestic skillset to build and operate the plants effectively. We have the capacity to learn those skills, but it is a workforce we don't have. This will add into the time to build, and the mistakes that will be made in the build that will need significant rectification. So if you said ""GO!"" right now, I genuinely believe we would be looking at 15 years before the first plant would be online. By which a vast number of our coal plants would have collapsed, and we would have had to build other solutions to keep things running anyway. So we may as well build renewable with hydro and battery storage now, because we can, and revisit nuclear in 15-20 years. Because the French are likely to have perfected a second wave of nuclear stations by that stage as they are about to have almost 50 nuclear plants come to end of life."
"Because TLDR if they were interested in helping Australian's, renewables are cheaper/faster/superior/better suited for Aus environment/landscape/infrastructure. However the main real reason is that the world doesn't have an answer yet to radioactive waste. We can put it in a concrete box and forget about it for 10,000 years but if the concrete box breaks or while waste is being transported to the facility, or any other unfortunate thing happens in a world beset by climate change powered disasters, we're going to have a bad time, and nobody wants that in their backyard. 'Putting it in a box for 10,000 years' is not an acceptable solution; it needs to be something we can deal with right now. If we could hypothetically convert nuclear waste into something totally harmless and not radioactive at all then the situation might change."
"There will be some against it because of the fear of nuclear with accidents and waste etc. Personally, for me, it's about the timing. Nuclear would have been great, 20+ years ago. Now, the LNP are basically pushing NBN v.2. 'Our option is cheaper, faster, better' But in reality will end up morr expensive, take longer, and by the time it's finally operational in 10-15 years time it will be obsolete and we'll be looking at ways to replace and upgrade it with the renewable tech wete pushing to invest in now anyway. And that's IF they actually do anything, and it's not just the pissing contest and posturing to stick with fossil fuels under the pretence of doing something that everyone kind of knows it is."
I'm not. Expense is the only down side.
Expense is the only down side. *points at brand new priority military targets*
I’m not completely against it but I think we should wait and see how the new natrium reactor in Wyoming does before we possibly go and spend a heap of money on what could soon be outdated technology. But then again that seems to be the Australian way.
Because it’s radioactive for the next gazillion years. Because the start up costs are enormous. Because the lead time to commission a reactor is too long and by then batteries will be a viable option for addressing the base load isssues
"Most well informed individuals are not, we’re just against it being used as an electoral bait. The coalition had nearly 2 decades in power where they could’ve lifted the ban and created a proper regulatory agency to oversee private initiatives. Did they? It’s never too late and going nuclear is probably the single most strategic step Australia needs to take in terms of self-reliance and energy safety. Having said that, don’t be fooled by disingenuous ‘projects’ that are little beyond a conceptual idea made solely for electoral purposes. The real obstacle for nuclear is (ironically enough) the greens, not labor."
"The ship has sailed. I am very pro-nuclear but it just doesn't fit for Australia in 2024. The time was when the rest of the word was getting in to it, the 60s to the 80s. Maybe even could have sold it up to the 2010s, but now the rise of renewables makes it a no brainer. My pro-nuclear passion is better put in to places that close down perfectly functional nuclear industries like Germany."
"Used to be a highly emotive issue without a lot of rationality. As a one-time supporter of nuclear, I'm becoming more skeptical as renewables come down in price."
"If the Liberal party were a liberal party they would remove legal barriers to nuclear, and then LET THE MARKET DECIDE. They would not use tax payer money to build and operate nuclear power plants that will take decades to go online and undermine all other investment in energy generation in the meantime. This isn’t about energy, it’s about power. They have zero interest in climate or energy, someone (probably Rupert) has just decided that this ‘policy’, with enough help from Murdochs minions, might just win over enough gullible voters to pick up a few seats in the next election. They will drop it like a radioactive spud after the election - especially if they win."
"This is what’s expected External consultant will be brought in to write up the proposal and review it, like PWC, EY, etc. cause gov doesn’t have any brains Takes 2 yrs writing just plan with 1000s of meetings Start fight with the state, local gov because NIMBY No right minded company will touch the project without a guarantee of elec price, so gov has to sign up with a dodgy company or do a back door deal under commercial confidence or nda. Public will only find the details 20yrs later with freedom of information request with heavily redacted paper. Operator can’t make money and gov can’t let them go bust, so elect price goes up. Waste disposal and maintenance oats sky rocket, elec price goes up. We love US so nuclear tech will be provided by US with inflated price, just like a submarine deal. We should consider nuclear, but not for a cheaper elect but for a diversified power source. If anything says we’re doing it for a cheap power it’s a stupid lie."
"The CSIRO believes that nuclear will cost 16 billion for Each reactor (tax payer funded) and take at least until 2040 to build. It is the most expensive form of power on the table. This proposal is not about securing a reliable energy future, it’s about destroying the renewable energy sector. They are not working for us, they’re working for the coal lobby, aka their donors."
I'm not. Bring it on! I live in the state with the largest dependence on renewables and we have the highest electricity prices in the developed world. Something isn't adding up.
I live in a state that is pretty much 100% renewable and our power is the cheapest .
You’re either talking about TAS or SA. The latter of which—the wholesale prices are some of the cheapest in the world. Everyone is getting screwed by their energy retailers.
"Timing. Initiated a decade or more ago, it could be providing relatively clean baseload capacity, and a good foundation to add renewable to (look at France and Germany). But now, with our power consumption straining the limits of what we have, it's ramp up is too long. For cost benefit, green energy and storage might be more expensive in the long run, but it has a much quicker timeline for ramp up (ie its already happening and adding to the network)."
"It’s expensive and when it goes bad, it goes really, really bad."
I have been favouring nuclear power for decades but it's time has now passed. It's the wrong answer at the wrong price. We don't need it or want it. Go away dutton. And while you're reading this peter please explain why you're proposing to drop the proposed emissions target. Is it a favour to someone who might be treasurer if Australia gets unlucky?
"I'm not against it but haven't looked into it enough to say I'm for it. However, this feels like one of the worst proposals in a long time, considering the scale of the proposal. The entire thing hinges them overturning laws both federally and at state level that declare nuclear power illegal. Coalition won't have the power to get that done and so the whole thing is unachievable. Therefore they've made a major platform that is already not that popular and also unachievable, which seems like a terrible mistake in appealing to voters as opposition."
It's a distraction. A ruse.
"It will come down to what is the cost per kWh, nuclear and renewable versus gas and renewables"
Nuclear is at least 2 to 3 times more expensive than those options.
That's an easy one. Nuclear is ALOT cheaper to run but more expensive to setup. Gas is cheaper to setup but ALOT more expensive to run.
I’m not… 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’d prefer to have batteries heavily subsidised to complement my existing solar… but anyway… both are better than burning coal…
If we wanted it we should’ve done it in the 50’s. Mr potato head is just getting paid a lot of money from the nuclear companies
*coal companies you mean. There are no nuclear companies in Aus
The Simpsons did it
Burn the coals
"Nuclear is fine. Nuclear as the option, right now, is not."
"There are so many clueless dreamers in here that think solar panels are going to power cities any time soon, it's actually hilarious. It's also hilarious that you think an equivalent output solar farm is any cheaper to build than a nuclear reactor, not to mention the absurd amount of space it would require, and the fact it would all need replacing every 20 years. (10 years for the batteries!) imagine ripping up a 1 GW solar farm every 20 years, oh and all the panels and batterys are all made from finite resources, how sustainable! You people literally live in dream land."
"I’m extremely pro-nuclear as an energy source. It’s the closest thing we have to magical unlimited power with no greenhouse emissions, and despite public misconceptions it’s also extremely safe (especially given we would have our pick of modern reactor designs). The problem is, the time for it was 40 years ago, not now. Everything I’ve read recently says that it’s simply no longer economically competitive with renewables + grid-level storage. So simply from that perspective I’m not sure it’s the way to go. Also building any infrastructure in this country is stupidly expensive, and if we’re talking about a type of infrastructure like this where it’s brand new for us and we have little local expertise, you can bet it’s going to be even more expensive."
It’s no longer the most cost effective option and Australia isn’t great at building infrastructure
"Because we’re trying to have a sensible conversation about it that is 20 years too late or 10 years too early. We’d be crazy to only just start planning & building a reactor using the technology that is commercially available today when there are pretty good signs that smaller, safer & less waste producing reactors are relatively near on the horizon."
"If there was a war on our turf I don't think anyone would feel safe if the nuclear plant was blown up. The fallout would be disastrous for our farms contaminating our food and water supply for decades. I hate coal too, but a coal plant could be bombed with no long lasting affect to the environment."
Too expensive to build. Too expensive to maintain. Too much lead time. (Too late) No existing industrial support. No existing infrastructure. No existing expertise. Cost per kW/h too high. (Higher power prices) Most importantly. There is no need to do it. It's a political stunt aimed at boomers and people who don't understand the technology and won't be around to inherit the cost.
I'm not against it. Maybe you need to actually poll the nation instead of assuming.
Have you not seen any of the documentaries on godzillas?
Godzilla is kinda badass
"The risk factor: when nuclear goes wrong, it is catastrophic. History has shown us this. A lot of our tourism is tied to our natural environment, so any risk factor to that is so unwise. And I kind of like Australia's environment? I'm gutted we've defaced so much of it with coal mines and development, I don't want to make it even worse. The cost: it will be insanely expensive to establish and the taxpayer will foot the bill; I think I also read that by the time it gets established, it will make power bills more expensive but I did just skim that article. I'm also side-eyeing the proposed locations and wondering who owns the land Dutton has named because the LNP loves to do business with their own people. Time: it will take over a decade to establish. That's going to do fuck-all for power bills right now except allow politicians to hand-wave away renewables because 'nuclear is coming'. We should be doubling down on renewables immediately. We have this enormous, gold-encrusted opportunity to become a world-wide leader in renewable energy technology and implementation, and we're watching fucking Voldemort demand nuclear power under the guise of 'helping Australian families' when his party has literally done nothing but drive power bills up, fuck housing, and dismantle Medicare for years."
We don’t need it. We’re not Europe
"There are a variety of reasons but there's one that pretty much makes it (and everything else I suppose) completely unviable: money. It would be such an unimaginable waste of money that even countries with nuclear industries would probably think it's a stupid waste of time for us to try.
Australia has the single most renewable energy resources on the planet with our solar and wind potential alone dwarfing everyone else. Renewables also get cheaper and better faster while being infinitely easier and faster to build.
By the time a nuclear reactor is finished here, renewables would dominate the grid to the point that the nuclear reactor would spend most of its time turned off as it'd actively cost money to sell the power. Any money spent on nuclear fission reactors would be infinitely better spent on researching and developing nuclear fusion instead.
.also, anyone that says things like ""the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine"" or whatever is speaking completely nonsense. Sunlight is relatively predictable, storage is getting better and power demand drops off dramatically while people sleep. As for wind, with our tens of thousands of KMs of coastline and loads of land, it is literally always blowing somewhere. Offshore wind in particular is pretty much always blowing. And, while the whole baseload power thing is increasingly becoming nonsense too, there are renewable sources of energy that are ""always on"" such as geothermal and tidal. At this point, the only reason to support nuclear fission here is ideological. In the interests of the economy, energy supply and actually cheap power, the only viable option for Australia is renewable energy for the foreseeable future. That is likely to change when nuclear fusion becomes commercially viable but until then, renewables it is. Note: I'm not against nuclear fission at all. There are a lot of countries it makes sense for. It just makes the least sense for Australia compared to every other country in the world. A lot of people just don't realise how truly blessed we are with renewable energy resources."
because investing in power generated from finite resources in 2024 makes no sense
It costs far more than renewables and does nothing to bring the cost of energy down. It also won’t start to operate for at least 15-20 years so we have to burn more coal and gas to make up the difference.
"Australia has a net zero emissions target for 2050, a nuclear power plant is not going to achieve net zero by 2050 if they start building it now, something like 100 years for nuclear power to have net zero embodied energy or something like that."
I imagine it’s harder to eliminate a countries power grid with mass renewables in play unlike 7 precision strikes on the nuclear sites. We’re far enough away from the other countries for that to be a realistic way of finishing us quickly.
"Maybe in the 80s but that ship has long since sailed, especially with all 30+ year build time even the benifits of producing our own uranium isn't enough to off set it. There's better things out there now. If we want to start desalinating our own water one day maybe, but otherwise it should be grid storage and renewable "
"Because there is still no way to manage the waste that is life threatening for more than 10,000 years. The country has to make a decision 30 years ago on what infrastructure and technology was going to be supported. They decided renewables and gas. Most of the states have done fantastically in financially incentivizing these to drive development, investment and economies of scale (in the case of end use solar PVs) It’s ridiculous to throw away all that and start again because the optics of renewables reminds people that cleaner energy is possible."
I’m assuming the main reason is that when it goes wrong it goes horribly wrong.
Chernobyl & Fukushima are 2 examples why.
The LNP had 10 years to implement Nuclear Power and didn't do it. If it was such a great idea why wasn't it implemented during their term... 🤔
My biggest concern is that ultimately this will be decided by the people who vote. The vast majority of these people have no scientific understanding of the subject and will vote for the party they've always voted for. A decision of this importance should be made by unbiased experts in the field.
"Nuclear is the filthiest energy source available. How much can we trust it not to meltdown like Chernobyl. Granted we are unlikely to suffer an earthquake or tsunami in Australia. How much do.you trust government to not give it away once built, or trust greedy corporations to operate safely. I don't. Nuclear power has some good points granted, but is it safe enough not to pollute with radiation for aeons.? And what do we do with the waste. Other countries have been trying to get Australia to take their waste for years. That pressure will increase once we have our own.dump. anyone trust a government to say no?"
Not against it. Just that it's a cynical distraction being pushed by the party that specialises in bad-faith policy and shilling for the IPA
Waste. Cost. Complexity.
Before we build any nuclear power plant solve the nuclear waste storage place first that seem to be harder to solve then to build one!
"Because we already have an enormous nuclear fusion powerplant. It's that yellow thing up in the sky. Combined with solar collectors and batteries, it's logically all we need. The sun requires no maintenance, no refuelling, no real estate, no spent fuel disposal, and no high-level security."
"Nuclear was an option decades ago, but I like the idea of utilising existing infrastructure where coal plants already exist with a nuclear replacement. I'm of the belief they want to delay the expiration of coal and gas for their lobby mates and nothing more. LNP are proposing something too late, and more expensive the same as their typical big ticket ideas. They don't have the ability to implement without States on board, and they don't have any idea on cost and are lying about time to implement. I don't trust any Government to keep nuclear waste from polluting our landscape or water sources. Why should we build expensive nuclear for 20 years' time instead of investing those funds into what's already working, is much cheaper and already here?"
Because it isn’t the best option
NPPs don't live in isolation. There is a full logistics chain from mine to plant that we don't even have right now. Not to mention the geopolitical tensions that come with the ability to refine in large quantities. It's a giant can of worms and it's entirely unnecessary as we can build renewables now so cheaply and cost effectively.
It’s the waste storage for me. Sweden is the only country that does it well. Also wind farm blades are toxic landfill.
"I’m just sharing my personal reasons why I am against nuclear power. The mining, refinement, and use of uranium produces extremely toxic waste. That waste needs to disposed of in a way that can guaranteed to remain safe for centuries. Realistically that waste will probably end up in either a rural backwater or Indigenous land, where complaints and problems will be ignored. Although relatively “safe” the consequences of an accident or terrorism are much greater than any other alternatives. It contributes to the risk of nuclear proliferation by conventional or unconventional means. Every nuclear power system in the world is backed by significant state subsidies and special legal dispensations. Provides another opportunity to introduce even more draconian police state laws to “protect” the uranium-nuclear industry. The construction (and decommissioning) of nuclear facilities is extremely long, we need faster alternatives. The cost of operating nuclear power is not cost effective compared to the alternatives. We have cheaper options. We will also need to invest and develop supporting industries, which will add to the costs and timescales above. The alternatives provide more options for community-control, flexibility, decentralisation, and independence. Nuclear feels unAustralian. We have a long proud history of rejecting the nuclear industry, this feels like another right-wing driven Americanisation or our national identity. I think the proposal is an entirely politically motivated and bad faith brain fart, which means it will likely turn into another NBN fiasco."
Chernobyl
"We're not against power produced by a nuclear reactor, we're against the politics, hopium and being constantly bullshitted to."
"It's too expensive and that's not even considering the cost of waste management. It is catastrophically dangerous if it fails Renewable technology outperforms it more safely and cheaply, especially with battery technology improving, and electrolysis of seawater to produce hydrogen from excess renewable energy will be a game changer for electricity, fuel burning industries and transport."
"Let's be very clear here. A nuclear power station's natural state is a massive fucking explosion that wipes out half the continent. It takes constant, round-the-clock monitoring, maintenance, and strict safety standards to prevent that natural state from occurring. Now, take those responsibilities and hand them to the LNP. The very first thing they will do is privatise the fuck out of it. Then there will be meetings to cut funding, costs and corners (in that order) to appease the board and shareholders. Then there will be a big fucking smoking hole near you, with a several hundred kilometer exclusion zone. Not even a catchy tourism slogan will get us out of that one."
"As usual if it's a really important political decision impacting our country's future like nuclear power.  The ""dick heads"" we elect are true to form & missed that boat it sailed decades ago."
It would have been worthwhile maybe 20-30 years ago. But now the cost to build and operate is not feasible. Any money these liberals want to pump into nuclear would be better spent on renewables. It honestly just sounds like something they thought sounds like a good idea to argue against Labor without any actual thought.
"It's more expensive than renewable. It produces radioactive waste that remains toxic for thousands of years. No matter how careful or competent the management, there is always the chance of a Chernobyl or a Fukushima. Since renewables are cheaper, safer and technology is improving all the time, it's a no-brainer to invest in more renewables. It's also pretty clear why Dutton and the Libs have suddenly decided that nuclear is the answer - and it's not remotely genuine. They know the cost will be prohibitive. And they know there is no way they can create the infrastructure of a nuclear-led grid before about 2045. It's simply a desperate bid to mess with our commitment to renewables and delay the de-commissioning of coal power stations in order to buy more time and profits for their mates (and major donors) in the mining industry. You'd have to be a complete moron to think they actually believed the pitch they're making."
"Nuclear power is financially very risky and environmentally very risky. IN different ways. Financially, it will cost a lot more money than we're told, that is almost certain. Environmentally, who knows? When they go bad, it is catastrophic, and Dutton wants to give us seven. On the finances, there is the construction risk: Australia has a bad track record at complex projects that we've never done before, mostly because they are complex projects we've never done before. We are too small to get any benefit from the learning experience either: I'm sure by the time we built the 6th Collins Class submarine we were getting the hang of it, but that's all we made. Nuclear plants cause huge financial problems even for those who have experience at building them, so it's double trouble. There is the traditional financial risk: the opportunity cost. Even if all goes well, they require operation of several decades to pay back the cost of construction and the absolutely staggering cost of decommissioning (because it is a very toxic environment). You get very committed when you go nuclear. But who knows what the future holds? This why business will not invest in this (unless the government takes most of the risk, by providing long term power prices that will probably end up massively more expensive than renewables). A lot of smart people are convinced that even with today's technology, we don't need nuclear. Renewables and storage are young technologies, there will likely be breakthroughs in the next 20 years, let alone the next 40. Nuclear is a big bet against renewables. Given how fast renewables have got cheaper and how fast batteries are getting cheaper, this is crazy bet. The business case for nuclear assumes today's cost picture for the cost of electricity it is competing with, but it is very hard to make credible predictions about the alternative costs so far in the future. It is a gamble. Heck, fusion is making progress. We're going to look pretty stupid with fission reactors at that point. And the environmental risk. They don't go wrong very often, but when they do, it's really bad. An accident like Fukushima would devastate the reputation of Australian agriculture for years. It would probably lead to a mass movement to close down the remaining reactors. In my opinion, there is a military advantage to the decentralised grid we get from renewables, too. It will be a hard grid to break. And if someone drops a bomb on a field full of solar panels, it doesn't cause mass deaths. And where will the waste go? We can't even agree on a place to keep low level waste. Are these risks worth it? No. We don't need nuclear power so why take all those risks? That's the thing. We don't need it. We might need to keep a few coal generators open a few years longer, and use more gas for ten years than some people would hope for. That does not mean we need nuclear, which won't be ready until 2040, for one of them.
Unless the plan is actually to stop the rollout of renewables and keep coal and gas going until then. That is the only way it makes sense, to artificially construct the need for nuclear. So there is deep suspicion about the motives. Incredibly bold call though. So much for the low profile pathway to government. The ALP will see which way the wind blows, but possible they might get a bit more politically bold too."
If this was a debate 40 years ago then we would have a conversation but being now bit late to benefit anyone
France has recently had to turn off a couple of reactors because of too much renewables.
We ain’t. Bring it on
"Because they are about 20years too late on it being a viable option, at this point it’s a waste of time and money just developed renewable"
Most of the comments on this thread come from young woke left wing nutters who have been brainwashed by like minded teachers and university academics.
Nuclear power is actually really clean energy. They use a fissile materials reaction to boil a fuck ton of water so the steam pushes a colossal turbine. That is what makes the power (Fun fact for those that don’t know already) It’s safe as long as the thing that fucked Chernobyl over doesn’t happen again I’d prefer renewables over nuclear with that risk
let build at your back yard.
Lack of education. Nuclear is far safer than coal.
Let create 7 accidents waiting to happen where the consequences can be totally fucked up. And let the government who can't even do NBN etc build them.
We have zero nuclear plant building knowledge in Oz. So we'd have to import that knowledge from overseas. Build time for these plants will take decades - what do we do in the meantime? Time and cost blowouts are inevitable. Other countries blowouts are in the tens of billions Small and medium plants are new tech - do we seriously expect the Aus gov to manage that appropriately? Fed libs need state gov ok to build nuclear plants. Most are against it.
"we can’t even be trusted to dispose of asbestos properly because it’s cheaper to dump it and make it someone else’s problem, or slip someone a few dollars to pretend they never saw it. The tradie attitude here is that PPE is for wimps. Who in their right mind would trust us to properly dispose of nuclear waste?"
Potential Kaiju attacks
This! The only reason you need. Have to invent the giant robots to fight them off first.
