"The problem with green hydrogen power plants is their lack of efficiency Many analysts believe that battery storage – charged by wind and solar – is a more efficient and cost effective way to meet short term dispatchable needs, and other technologies such as pumped hydro can solve the long term and seasonal problems. I agree. Using enormous amounts of renewable energy to extract hydrogen in order to burn it in a power plant and recover only a small portion of the original energy is grossly inefficient. Add to that the fact the cost of an electrolyzer plant, additional renewable energy generation, storage and hydrogen-ready power plant is likely far more than a grid-scale battery or even pumped hydro storage. And to top it off burning hydrogen also produces nitrogen oxide, a harmful air pollutant. This sounds like yet another hydrogen boondoggle pushed by the fossil fuel industry."
"In order to assess the potential for profit or loss you need to consider the economic efficiency not the energy efficiency. Two months worth of stored energy via grid scale batteries or pumped hydro would be an astronomical cost. Remember: economic efficiency, not energy efficiency. They aren't the same number."
"The energy efficiency of the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla (energy output versus energy input) is indeed quite low. Nevertheless the economic efficiency (value of energy output versus cost of energy input) is over 100%. So the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla will make money. The hydrogen power plant at Whyalla will be 100% funded by the taxpayers of South Australia, who happen to be the same people as the energy consumers of South Australia. So the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla will be run as a consumer's cooperative. It will have the goal of reducing energy prices for the energy consumers of South Australia rather than the goal of pecuniary profit for private investors. The hydrogen power plant at Whyalla has absolutely nothing to do with the fossil fuel industry."
"I agree. Using enormous amounts of renewable energy to extract hydrogen in order to burn it in a power plant and recover only a small portion of the original energy is grossly inefficient. I was in a discussion about that yesterday and my napkin math came out to electrolysis hydrogen > storage > generator vs current average flow battery i/o effeciency, flow battery wins by a massive margin, its efficiency is about double of what a hydrogen storage system would be. Hydrogen will end up being for places you can use a battery and probably nothing else. But if we're going to need it, we should be generating it in the cleanest ways we can."
Yeah sounds like green washing similar to the clean coal scam.
"Electricity-Hydrogen-Electricity is maybe 40% efficient, add in transport and it just gets worse. Ideally we need something small and scalable so homes and factories can use excess wind/solar to generate hydrogen, store it locally until winter for use. I guess the question is whether the excess wind/solar is better used in biomass production of synthetic hydrocarbons since this would have the side benefit of capturing atmospheric CO2 and allow the continued use of existing infrastructure and engines."
"There is no transport involved in the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla. The electrolysers the hydrogen storage and the dispatchable hydrogen power generators are all located at the same site. The energy efficiency of this plant, being the ratio of input energy versus output energy, is indeed low. Nevertheless the economic efficiency, being the ratio of the cost of the input energy versus the value of the output energy, is over 100%."
"why do people forget biogas, we already know how to produce it and is easily scalable. 75 euros per MWh..."
"Ok thanks for confirming my napkin math yesterday - that's about where I landed by figuring average electrolysis efficiency, compression, and then generator efficiency. Even on the low end of the scale flow batteries were around 80% so its not even close."
"By way of example at 3:00 pm AEST on 3rd Feb 2023 the power produced in South Australia from all sources was 2,031 MW, however the local demand was only 1667 MW at the time. Rooftop solar 66.5%, Wind 42.1% and Utility solar 4.3% of local demand, so total renewable energy production was 1942 MW representing 112.9% of local demand. Exports were -18.1% of local demand (the export link was saturated) and grid battery charging was -2.5% of local demand. The spot price for grid electricity at the time was -$115/MWh.
These figures illustrate the desperate need in South Australia to be able to absorb excess grid power at times of abundant renewable energy."
"From the article: Green hydrogen is a much hyped commodity. And the world is full of opinions and lists of what it will, and what it won’t do. And at the very bottom of one well-respected ladder of opportunities is using green hydrogen as a balancing power plant for a renewables grid. Yet that is exactly what the South Australian government has promised to do. It intends to build a 250MW hydrogen electrolyser – 10 times bigger than any other operating plant in the world – to feed into a 200MW hydrogen power plant, which would also be the biggest in the world. Some modelling for how the electrolyser and power plant might work has been provided by Frontier Economics. It is justified by South Australia’s desperate need for new load to soak up the excess power it produces, particularly from rooftop solar in the middle of the day, and its rapidly expanding portfolio of large scale wind and solar. It shows the hydrogen electrolyser (see graph above) will likely operate during the day-time hours when solar – both from large scale solar farms and particularly rooftop solar – is abundant. The power plant will be more flexible, producing electricity at peak times when the price is high. It will rarely operate when the electrolyser is working. “There is no opportunity to arbitrage spot prices if the electrolyser and hydrogen turbine operate at the same time,” Frontier says."
"And at the very bottom of one well-respected ladder of opportunities is using green hydrogen as a balancing power plant for a renewables grid. Note that ""balancing"" here means short term storage. It puts long term grid storage at a much more favorable level, near the top of the ladder. I like this ladder, it looks well done and conforms to my expectations :). It does not appear to have included ""grid backup"" though (that is, dealing with rare correlated and prolonged outages of wind and sun, which would require unaffordable amounts of wind/solar overprovisioning and/or batteries to overcome.) Desulfurization demand goes away when petroleum goes away."
