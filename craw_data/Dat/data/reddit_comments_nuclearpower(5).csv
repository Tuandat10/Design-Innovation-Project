"The GenCost reports need to be taken with a healthy dose of scepticism, more than anything else they are marketing documents for the government to sell renewables to the public. Here's a nuclear expert response to the report: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_J1gSeWomA"
Look like CSIRO have an serious anti-nuclear bias!
"I'm pro nuclear but I'm not crazy. Nuclear may be better in a region where renewable resources are inefficient (American Southeast and Northwest), and in a country that is great at large construction projects and/or has an easier regulatory environment (UAE, China, eastern Europe), but I am not surprised that Australia will lean towards renewables. I think people miss the nuance of regional energy resources and the importance of complimentary energy sources. A grid with 100% nuclear wouldn't be efficient, and in most places 100% renewables will not be efficient. They both have production profiles that are difficult to match to demand and create a need for peaking sources."
"A grid with 100% nuclear wouldn't be efficient Man, nobody on hearth ever pushed for this."
