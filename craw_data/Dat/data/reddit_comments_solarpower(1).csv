"Not exactly sure, but could be that it is so normalised here that there are some scale efficiencies (grid connection, importing and warehousing etc). There were originally good government subsidies, and there have been utility funded financing plans. Some door to door sales but wouldn't trust them myself. I know the scale thing seems odd as there are almost never scale efficiencies for Australia compared to the US but the vast majority of our people live in just five major cities. You probably aren't seeing costs for regional or rural connections"
"I live rurally, so it was more expensive than in one of the big cities. This was in mid-2020. Installation itself (12.25kW panels/2x5kW inverters) took a day, and was live on the grid that evening. SMA inverters and some Chinese brand panels through a large-ish installer (who are still around). Total cost was $17700 before rebates. I think, for once, that economies of scale are working in our favour. There’s not a house in our street without solar, and I think it’s more than 1/3ᴿᴰ of freestanding houses across the country that have it."
"Less. Its about $1 per watt (and that is $Aud) for a well designed system. Add in the REC's (renewable energy credits) and you are looking at even less - Had a mate get 6.6kw installed for $4500 (~$3000 USD, or less than 50c per watt). Panels are stupidly cheap too - for example - Jinko 440 Watt 108 Cell TIGER NEO Mono-Facial N-Type - $198 Aud each. And that is a single panel retail from tradezone with GST applied (ie. you could walk in off the street and buy it). Ex installer here too. Its a race to the bottom with a lot of the systems that are installed, quite a few stupid rules (the old rooftop isolators for example - caused quite a few fires). As long as you have the right meter installed (smart meter, bi-directional) - most people are pre-approved to connect 5kw per phase (10kw in some areas) and all it takes is an inspection and a quick meter reprogram (or they just inform the distributor) and bam its on - the most I have seen recently is a week from install to connection. Personally, I am running 13kw of panels, and 40kwh of lithium batteries. No concept of a power bill here, it keeps going into credit (even over winter) - all electric, 5 bedroom place with a pool, heat pump HWS and airconditioning."
"Solar is very widely advertised is Aus and is pretty common. I’d say 70% of people in my street have it. Depending on what state (NSW here) there are government subsidies, which might vary depending on what state you live in. I had a 10kw system installed for around $6900 after government subsidies. $10000ish before. 415w jinko solar Tiger N-Type panels and a goodwe inverter. You can finance the install and most installers offer it. It took 1 day to install and was up and running the same day. In saying that my house already had an upgraded meter box, which would have added more time if I needed to have that upgraded. No local government involvement. Iam not sure how much electricity costs in the US on average but In Aus we get bent over a barrel. My electricity bill was around $1000 a quarter. Average sized home 2 adults 2 children. Solar hot water and no pool. The power bill has dropped significantly in the summer months. I just wish batteries were more affordable."
"I heard a thing saying the finance costs for a solar system are less than the savings from that system. In other words, you could have $0, borrow the lot, and still be ahead."
"For residential grid connected solar installs, there is a government rebate on panels. This comes in the form of certificates that will be signed over to the installer and can be traded. I just checked and they are worth roughly $0.4 per watt, so a significant discount. I think that one of the advantages in Australia compared to USA is that we have a stronger Federal Government and less state independence. The solar programs, accreditation etc are run at a national level and that makes the process more uniform and streamlined. Of course individual states, the local electrical providers and the local government can put their requirements and approvals on top of it too, but the national programs are the foundation."
"I financed mine, $5000 for 6.6kw system. Government green loan @0.99%pa over 5 years. It will cost me only $127 in interest by the end of the term."
I upgraded my system to a 6.6KW system. Wanted to go 10KW but western power said no. After rebate it was like $6k. Company had 0% finance for 5 years. So I financed the lot. Power bill went from being $500-$600 a billing cycle to $92. Quite happy with that result.
"When solar technology got to the stage of marketability, the state governments made a conscious decision to promote it in order to create economies of scale - which succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Here in Western Australia, the government decided that because solar panels are visible, it becomes a perpetuating trend where people can be more sustainable and save themselves money long term. (There were a few options at the time in terms of sustainable projects and residential rooftop solar was picked as the one which would have the most enduring impact). The WA state government provided a pretty sizeable rebate on solar panels, and then also the feed-in tariff was huge. It was a massive cost to the government, but it was done deliberately to create a market for solar and drive down the prices over time. It was incredibly successful, and as the goal was met, the feed-in tariffs were reduced more and more. (WA electricity is state owned and highly subsidised so this didn’t involve commercial interests). I was working in electricity at the time and remember when one Minister was upset that it was so successful ($$$) and the other Minister was jubilant. It was hilarious. Being one of the sunniest places in the world, it totally makes sense. Our home panels paid for themselves in 2 years. It’s all free energy from here."
"In Australia, there is no need for a building permit when installing rooftop solar panels. Additionally, govt offers a substantial upfront rebate for solar installations, with the installer taking care of the paperwork. The quoted price for individuals includes this rebate, making it lower. In comparison, the United States faces higher average electricity prices than Australia. Consequently, companies in the U.S. enjoy a significantly higher profit margin compared to their Australian counterparts. This is because the consumer return on investment (ROI) remains favorable, allowing them to justify and afford more expensive installations."
"The federal government subsidises homeowners for their systems. It’s an unfair system; not everyone is privy to it, only homeowners are and only once. Those who don’t benefit subsidise it through taxation while not benefitting from the bill savings. Most renters aren’t privy to it and only one state so far has installed it on their public houses so many of the most disadvantaged don’t benefit from it either."
"Slightly incorrect. You can install a system on Monday, claim the subsidy. Rip it off on Tuesday, install a new system on Wednesday and claim subsidy again. And so on and so on."
"Yes people generally use payment plans to pay for their solar as it is still a pretty large investment. There was a decent feed in rate for electricity that kickstarted the solar industry. Solar companies were able to garnish that rate to help with finance. It's pretty low now but solar is cheaper. Electricity is more expensive and WFH was a thing so the convenience of running your air conditioner all day for no cost is amazing. I think people are too focused on the payoff time instead of the benefits. It's mostly phone call/cold call leads and offers on billboards. Cold callers get a list of numbers probably from an expression of interest website, get the clients details, salesman comes to home to pitch them the product. Had a friend do cold calling, $600 per lead that led to a sale, got a company phone to use while he was doin it. Although you're mostly on your own. Installs are usually half day affairs. They slap some aluminum brackets down and mount the panels. An electrician comes round later to set up the box."
No idea of price difference? We got i think an 8KW system for $11 000. I think in 2018? Installed & connected in 1 day. We didn't have to do anything. Installers did all that.
"Mainly red tape. USA installers have to get permits for each system and the council (or whatever your equivalent is) goes out and inspects it individually before connecting it to grid. Our regulations are much more streamlined. We also use Chinese imports, whereas USA have tariffs on those. We get government subsidies as well. I paid ~$6k (after the $2.5k subsidy) for 6.6kw panels + 5kw inverter. This was mid range (pricing wise). We’ve had solar for years in Australia so it’s not really something to “learn about”? You get quotes for installation, they sort out the paperwork in the background and install it. Mine took about 4 weeks between deposit paid and installation. Approval from the utility provider was obtained the day after installation."
"Not 100% sure why, but I had to give up commenting in the solar subreddit about it coz it made a lot of Americans frickin mad"
It’s better if you do comment so more people know the crazy differences in prices
America ban from selling Chinese panels
"There’s no ban on selling China panels in the US, they’re still being sold here. There’s tariffs on Chinese panels, and buying panels from Vietnam or Malaysia is just as cheap."
"I put in solar in late 2019, early 2020. 6.5kW for about $4.5K. Was not the cheapest, but far from the most expensive. Also have 3 phase power, which adds a little to the price."
Was that cost before subsidies and rebates?
"There are multiple government grants, subsidies & loans available which make it cheap, this has led to solar being very popular making it cheaper again. I did a 6.6kW system a few years back. Quote was $7710, however there were $3010 STC (small-scale technology certificate) fereral government credits and a $1888 state government grant. After all that the out of pocket cost was $924 (cash) + $1888 (interest free loan repaid over 4 years).
Original price $1.17/watt, cost to customer ~$0.42/watt. Inspection was about 2 weeks after install, $60 meter reconfigure cost and it was producing."
"Solar has been common in Australia since the '70s at least. Solarhart hot water systems started around the late '70s. I got solar on my shed roof about 12 years ago. Iirc it's a 16kva array and I paid $5K outright for it. There were government rebates to lower the cost. Just a few weeks ago I tried to find out how much a battery would cost. I found a website, made an appointment with a salesman. Eventually I managed to pin him down to:- a battery would cost about $11K to buy outright, at present there are government rebates to reduce that to about $6K. HOWEVER. This particular salesman insisted that before I could get the battery I would have to sign up for another 12 panels on the house roof, because he insisted the battery would have to be installed right beside the meter box, which is on the house (so far nobody agrees with him, btw). He finally caved and admitted the whole 12 panel array would be $22K outright including rebates. I have yet to shop around some more and see what other companies are offering. There are loans available, even interest free. All that I've seen use one's electricity retailer as a loan manager. One can pay them off with excess electricity fed back into the grid. Both federal and state governments have rebates on solar and battery installations.  Edit to say my solar took about a week to order and installation took 3 hours. Back then one had to wait for approval from the energy wholesaler which took a couple of days."
Government subsidies of about 50%
I don't know but I need new batteries on credit right now
"We bought from one of the largest energy retailers, Origin, a big company with a long history. Service was excellent. They gave three choices of panels, three inverter choices, a 25 year warranty on the panels, and interest free 36 monthly payments. 6kw system, $6000 in a rural area several years ago. They of course got the RECs. But it's already paid for itself."
My observations are that solar started as a good investment from FIT. Then power prices went up and it was self consumption and FIT. Now FIT has gone and it's only self consumption and battery charging. The payback ratios must have blown out to years
"We only deal with one utility power company here, so everything is geared towards going forwards ie community batteries micro and major major being installed…esp WA with it’s high hrs of sunshine per year."
"Ive had a few people come to the house over the years trying to sell solar, i also cant scroll on reddit or fb without seeing an ad. We financed our solar for 2 years interest free but i don’t remember the cost"
"With so many investment properties, why would anyone install solar on one of them? The tenant pays his bills."
"We paid 22,000 for a 13.2 kw system 2 weeks ago..440watt longi panels 10kwGE inverter,no battery.This system is on the high end we are high uses,$1200 a quarter plus or minus and payments are much lower than the bill would be,no brainer really,3 ways to monitor, GE has app,I have solar analytics and my power company monitor. 13 days has produced over 700kwh with overcast weather some days,we have 10kw limit on feed in.
