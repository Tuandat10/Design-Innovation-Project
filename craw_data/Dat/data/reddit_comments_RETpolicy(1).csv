"We need 40 turbines per month to pass, meaning that we will fail this exam for sure No like we can’t tax the coal/oil/gas like Norway and use all this tax for renewables, what are we waiting for"
"No Transition without Transmission. The bottle neck is the transmission network. Unless the Transmission projects on the East Coast get a boost of support it won’t matter what we have got to generate power. It won’t reach the consumer. WRL, G-Rez and most importantly VNI-West are all facing resistance from communities in their path. An equitable solution that satisfies rural concerns and need as well as including the community’s in the benefits of the projects is long overdue. Rewrite our Electricity Acts for the 21st Century and provide compensation that gives incentives to communities to be involved. The difference in compensation for those hosting the all important transmission lines and those hosting the wind towers and solar farms is massive. The transmission hosts need to be included in the bounty that will flow from these changes. Thank you for reading my comments."
"Anzac Day and it’s a celebration of Tim Tams, victa lawn mowers, hills hoists and someone will get technical and knowingly claim Wi-Fi to the list. But come every other day of the year and it’s why we can’t. Unions, labour rates, too small a population, easier to dig stuff up. The audacity of calling Brit’s whinging poms is quite ironic if it wasn't so catastrophic."
"""there's also the issue of where these turbines will be built"" in the notoriously small, density populated Australia without any coastline you mean?"
"Here's the wind farms https://reneweconomy.com.au/large-scale-wind-farm-map-of-australia/ https://reneweconomy.com.au/big-battery-storage-map-of-australia/ https://reneweconomy.com.au/large-scale-solar-farm-map-of-australia/ Look at private investment for renewables, like above, and then private investment for nuclear. Who is telling you people to advocate for nuclear so hard? It's the most unrealistic, stupid proposition for Australia."
"Imagine it's all bullshit, and create all this cheap power for nothing. I want my gas lead recovery now"
https://www.energymining.sa.gov.au/industry/modern-energy/hydrogen-in-south-australia Does hydrogen count as a gas lead recovery?
They're deliberately destroying the middle class. Flooding the country with new arrivals. Slowing down or halting the infrastructure needed to support them.
"This sub is Australian Facebook Boomers. ""MUUUGHHHH IMMMAAAGRATION"" IM NOT RACIST THO ""THESE DAMN LEFTEEES. REEEEEEE"" ""Peter Dutton is sensible and has good points about things... A DERP"" ""Rental issues are awful and its... LABOURS FAULT."" HOW dare they not have fixed over 12 consecutive years of policy that created this entire situation in less than a term ""I Know NOTHING ABOUT RENEWABLES BUT THEY'RE BAD"" What's the point of trying to cut emissions if we don't reach an arbitrary time line. It's fucking embarrassing to even sub lurk and study information passing here."
I'm so excited that we're going to get all this cheap energy. Lets just hope that the private energy companies don't just use the lower unit costs to simply increase their profits?

"At any point in the day Australia now generates 90 - 120% of it's total energy requirements from renewable sources. Complete bullshit. Look at this website and tell me you don't actually believe that.

The big steelworks factory here in Newcastle is closing down Seems like a strange decision considering this is their goal
Cassanova Bowen is deluded. Renewables are expensive and without massive taxpayer subsidy the private sector isn't interested. China is the only place that makes money from renewables.
Problem is he’s deluding plenty of other people as well.
"Blackout Bowen will bankrupt Australia. The truth of the cost come out last week and it’s in the trillions. The government in conjunction with the private sector are unable to afford this cost so guess who will pick up the tab. What sort of dickhead would shut down our only reliable power source with nothing ready to replace it. Coal fired power is the best, cheapest, reliable and greener than renewables. Before you say thats not true do a little research on what goes into making solar panels, wind turbines, their breakdown rate and how they’re not financially viable to and are unable to recycle them. They contain some of the most deadly chemicals know to man but ssshhhhhh that’s ignored and not understood."
Renewables + Nuclear?
Will not be online by 2030 so irrelevant.
"We should be building nuclear too. Renewables can do most of the work, but they can't get us to 100."

"We need Angus Taylor in the job, nothing screams good at basic math like that cardboard cutout of a human."
Bowen has never met a portfolio he could manage competently
I question whether this is even feasible. So if we didn’t build 40 last month then that’s 80 next month. Two every weekday. It just doesn’t make sense.
