I'm new to the area and deeply regret joining all the local community groups on Facebook as they're absolute cesspits of people sprouting cooker nonsense and NIMBY crap about the wind farms. I don't even understand what they're saying about the turbines 'ruining the pristine coastline'...there's constant streams of giant coal (?) ships going far closer to shore than the turbines will be.
it will merely ruin their pristine nostalgia
Don’t pay too much attention to them. We’ve always had a few cookers around generally but as soon as the wind farm stuff started being talked about a suspiciously large number of community groups with vague names and intentions started popping up that were all mysteriously anti wind farm and spouting the same messages. This is the nature of coordinated anti-renewable campaigning these days. If you took a real poll of everyone across the Illawarra in person you’d find the vast majority are for it. (Edit for damn typos)
It has apparently been downsized and moved from 10 to 20 km offshore. It will be practically invisible and over horizon at sea level.
Tell that to the cookers
Am I the only one who thinks wind farms are cool looking?
I enjoy seeing them driving to or past Canberra.
"Such a relief that commonsense has prevailed on this one. While anti-OSW folks whip themselves up into a fear-fuelled fever dream, it’s a relief to know we’re pushing ahead with the transition to renewable energy. Yes, we need to do more and faster, but it’s a start. "
"I feel more stupid after reading some of those comments. It's always the same arguments. The negative side will always claim it's scientifically bad and there is ""heaps"" of research but can't or won't link any citations then attack someone who is for the positive, demand citations and reduce the argument down to name calling. It's sad that there are people out there who take what they hear from news or read on Facebook as gospel and can't engage in critical thinking."
"What I do not get is that if you’re arguing for views and marine life - they both benefit from it. The ships destined for Botany will no longer be able to park here. That is better views, less pollution, less noise and better for marine life."
Finally I find people who are for it although I do believe we are the silent majority in this case. I don't understand any of their issues
"Considering they are now wanting to start charging those with solar that feed back into the grid, Im all for the windturbines, but it should be backed with a large battery storage facility. It makes no sense that those that adopted solar will have to start paying to feed it to the grid, rather then the other way around. Its not like it stopped us paying for power at all, it just brought my bill down to like $200 instead of $1000 i was paying."
What? Are you serious? I was just thinking about getting solar. Who is advocating for this? And hiw can they justify it withvour reusable energy targets?
The actual poll for the mercury is on their site behind a paywall. The results are already going to be goosed.
"I would be surprised if it happens as there is no way it can be cheaper/cost effective than having an on-shore wind turbine, do they forget we have alot of free land here in Australia?"
Onshore has more nimbys Offshore is more exxy but would also save billions in avoiding batteries as it has a higher capacity factor. And its near consumers saving billions in transmission too
"The point of offshore is the reliable source of wind power, if you watched 4Corners on the ABC on Monday 10/6 you'd see that it doesn't matter where, offshore or land based there will be opposition."

"Yeah id like to improve the gong what’s wrong with that? I grew up here, nice beaches and nature, close to Sydney. Cons are more expensive housing than Melbourne, high emissions, terrible public transport, car dependency and costs here. What would you like to see improved"
"People like you are why the Illawarra is gradually becoming a feral backwater. All the well adjusted locals I know support changes which will objectively improve all our lives. And yes, I'm also a local."
