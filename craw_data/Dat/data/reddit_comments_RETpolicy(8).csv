"Makes one proud to be a South Australian, not saying - doing"
Isn't SA's target now 75%?
"Shame on WA. Huge areas of land, lots of sun, lots of wind, lots of coastline. No emissions or renewable targets."
"NSW is interesting. No target, yet sitting at 17%?"
And where does ACT plan to get 78% remaining renewable energy by 2020? Change what weâ€™re importing off the grid?
"Does it matter if you have a renewables target before 2050 of you have a net zero by 2050? As long as you're meeting targets on the road to net zero, the amount of renewables is superfluous. Plus if the entire east coast and SA is net zero... Who gives a shit about WA and Darwin?"
