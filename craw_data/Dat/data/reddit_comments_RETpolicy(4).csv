The forecasts that Australia will undershoot the goal come as resistance grows to a number of major high-voltage power lines that backers say are essential to connecting ever greater amounts of wind and solar generation. Resistance is the last thing you want when building high-voltage power lines!
"Ohm, yeah I guess I agree with that"
And with Murdoch media beating the drum and stirring up residents and farmers about these transmission lines every day you can see how the flat earth worshippers are trying to set the agenda. They are really doing everything to sabotage any alternative energy agenda here in Australia by stirring up stupid people.
"Opponents of planned transmission lines in Victoria have stepped up their attacks on the proposals, which they claim would cause needless social and environmental damage while saddling consumers with billions in extra costs. NIMBYism is going to do us in."
Stupid fucking boomers trying to make one last ditch effort to fuck up the country a bit more before they get into nursing homes
We be fucked...
"We have the ability to push new projects through quickly, but it will mean fast-tracking the environmental impact studies, public consultation periods, government oversight, and probably overruling community concerns. Probably hiring more bureaucrats to help as well. One result of that is that there‚Äôs likely to be some projects going ahead that shouldn‚Äôt have gone ahead. That‚Äôs fine, we can do that (and have done that many times in the past), but that‚Äôs the trade off we‚Äôre talking about."
"Despite UNESCO's ruling, Labor's climate policies will still see the death of the reef. The only way our government can take the necessary action to fight the climate crisis (to the extent a country like Australia can) is to declare a emergency and use emergency powers."
"We have run out of time to avoid a non-radicle future. We really have only two choices now, neither leading to a nice place. We don‚Äôt change anything, on going lies, rhetoric and delay as temperatures exceed dangerous for all limits. Ignoring the need for international equity. Pass on a huge burden to all humans. Renege on the Glasgow and Paris commitments. Looking at more than 3C of warming, virtually sterilising Australia and most of the world. This option lets us continue with todays politics and maintain the current economic market model. This will lead to eco extremism to ramp up, sabotage and terrorism will take place as people take matters into their own heads and hands. A deep, rapid and organised decarbonisation of society. Policy will look different place to place, but policy will be overarching, controlling, and vastly unpopular. Yet, we will be taking international equity and development seriously. Perhaps limit warming to 2C (still apocalyptic conditions). But we may start the road to a real zero future (pie in the sky stuff here). To achieve this we would need a massive ramp up of leadership (FDResk fireside speeches). Reshape mainstream economics so human capital is not viewed and being uncoupled from the natural world and with equity at its core. Ultimately rethinking what constitutes growth, progress and development. Really either option is not pleasant. In a society that failed to wear masks during a pandemic I‚Äôm far from optimistic at our chances. The time for technological solutions has passed. The northern hemisphere is already at 1.4c. This is having massive cascading impacts already (go read some food security papers in India/China for this year). We apparently have 9 years left in the global carbon budget (seems like a massive over estimate now). How is the global south meant to develop to a point where they can share the quality of life we enjoy in Australia with that little of the budget left? The restructuring of our energy mix, let alone overhauling the National car fleet will throw us well over the carbon budget (this is just for one small nation). To put this change in perspective, Emissions from today will be causing climate damages and warming for the next 300 years at least. Yes, driving your car today will be warming the planet for at least 300 years into the future. No amount of carbon credits is going to make up for that. The only option left is the social change. Yet, I worry people will never accept option two and the sacrifices this option entails. Would you be ok if Australia ceased exporting fossil fuels and took a massive hit to our GDP? Because that‚Äôs the level of change required now. Again we couldn‚Äôt all pull our heads together and wear masks. Or agree on how much to pay teachers, or to allow one and another to marry who they please, or allow First Nations individuals to be properly represented in our ‚Äúfunctional democracy‚Äù. I worry for the future, I worry deeply about the coming summers. We deserve what ever comes our way. Happy Sunday!"
"We both knows it‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. The political system won‚Äôt allow it. We can‚Äôt even agree it build more homes, how could we agree to ‚Äúless stuff for us‚Äù, which what would have to happen to halt the climate future. Bike lanes being controversial is proof there is no hope. So give up, it‚Äôs better for your mental health."
"""problems"" Translation: ""Gubbiment being in bed with and happily sucking the cock of big business."""
have a read of the article. the problem is community groups and farmers etc opposing the transmission lines being built. nothing to do with big business.
We are a democracy. We absolutely get the government we deserve. Which doesn't speak well of us frankly.
developing countries doing way better to meeting its target. its just fucking pathetic were doing.
All good. Just set a 2050 target instead. The politics of making promises you won't be around to deliver on
"The bit where the government dreamed up a suddenly eighty percent target for 2030 is the unhinged bit. Not very long ago at all we had a 50% target in Queensland, with not very much action behind it, a 50% target in Victoria, with a bit of state government PPA and rooftop solar action behind it, nothing in NSW, too much renewable in SA for stability and a fever dream of a new HVDC interconnector in Tasmania. Things are changing and there's been some progress but to jump to 80%-like-right-now-folks does nothing more than illustrate the utter paucity of our political class's grasp on reality. It's like that dude that jumped off the cruise ship expecting it to turn around and pick him up: not going to happen. We built our coal-fired power system on top of coal fields, but that ain't where the sun shines and the wind blows. Some people who didn't have to look at power lines are going to have to look at power lines."
Dad reckons powerlines are a reminder of man's ability to generate electricity.
"It's ok we'll get Singapore build massive solar plants on our land, by taking loans and giving money to Singapore and accepting any cost of unforseen risk. Then connect a giant power line to Singapore. Then when we need the power we'll buy from Singapore at global market rate."
What‚Äôs the biggest road blocks are you folks facing with renewables? üá®üá¶ü§ì
Mainly nimbys and required upgrades of transmission infrastructure
"Yes, that was assured in 2014 with Tony Abort. He did it for the women. Bahahaaa"
Is anyone actually surprised?
"When has Australia ever done anything competently? There was never any intention to do this, it was just to ease pressure from other countries who actually care about the environment."
If only the government took the climate target that it set itself seriously.
Yeah Global Net Zero 2050 ain't happening.
"I hate the idea of geosolar engineering but I don't think we are going to have a choice. This is fucked. Involuntarily aquirmemt is a horrible option but it is less bad than climate change. I know politics is bad at choosing a lesser evil and instead doing nothing in hope of a perfect solution but they need to sort this. It really becomes a global, and thus national, security issue and should be treated as such."
"Renewable energy policy that mostly relies on Chinese-import solar PV is just not sustainable. Some people will pretend that Australia is self-sufficient by pointing out that Australia has some Solar Panel manufacturers, but they often forget almost all materials of Solar PV are made in China. Worse yet, the crisis is looming ahead as the Chinese gov't will stop subsidising their Solar PV industryand will force their Solar PV to raise costs to re-coup the cost of investment."
The modern solar panel was invented by an Australian in Australia. If it wasn't for successive short-sighted governments we'd be a major exporter of solar PV.
"Whats hilarious is people point at other power technologies as having high sovereign risk to them, or having highly neo-liberal funding models. Intentionally neglecting how modern solar panels came about and where they get manufactured, really cool pinnacle human technology that we've only had scale viable models of being produced in the last 10-15 years."
Australia is sending itself broke. While China is building 92 coal powered power plants this year alone. We are the dumbest country.
No mention of Snowy Mountains 2.0. Is it still well behind projected finishing time?
"Firstly, connect eastern and western grids by expanding high voltage infrastructure. Secondly, government investment in large scale storage"
"Nope, WA will remain independent"
They built this on hopes and dreams not facts.
U eill hazard a guess that there is Not enough lucrative gruberment money coming in to make it happen..
"And there is a question of recycling of Solar PV panels at the end of their life-cycle. It is not only a messy process that produces a lot of toxins, but the recycling of Solar PV is financially not feasible at the moment."

"""once their grid penetration hits their capacity factor"" Those are two entirely different concepts, I have no idea what on earth you're talking about. Read AEMO's GenCost 2023, they include the costs of transmission and energy storage needed to firm renewables. Since you say renewables are comedically expensive, what do you think their levelized cost of electricity is in $/MWh?"
"I'm sorry - but explain to be about how a 15-18Billion dollar nuclear plant that will take 10-15 years to build makes sense? And don't talk about SMRs - that shit isn't anything but a ""design"" right now. The nuclear debate is dumb once you take the culture wars out of the spent fuel. It simply doesn't make sense from a dollars and time perspective."
