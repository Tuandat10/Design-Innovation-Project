"Dad installed a 6kW system at his place with a 9kWh battery... cost was $18k installed. His bills went from $800 a quarter to $26. The more I've learned about solar, the more I've realised it depends greatly on when you're consuming the most juice. If you're at home and can run the dishwasher, washing machine and have a hot shower while the sun's still out. You'll speed up the payback period with a battery if you're consuming a fair chunk of electricity during evening peak hours, but it remains a huge expense on top of just getting a solar array installed."
Saving $774 / quarter means $3 096/year paying off an $18000 install will take 6 years. we've assumed summer performance though in winter - I can't produce much solar during june-july-august and end up needing to import a fair bit. That's pretty good. Did you get any subsidies on the battery? Batteries alone usually sell for about $15k for a 10kwh where I am.
"Yep, we’re similar, though with a 9kWh system… WFH family, run the house off the solar during the day & charge the battery - which depending on what we need to to at night (e.g. if it’s really hot and we’re running aircon, it’ll drop faster, a couple of lights and tv, much slower) will last us anything from maybe midnight to 5am. Similar reduction in bills. We’ve also got an emergency reserve on our battery that can only be accessed in the event of power failure - just runs one circuit to keep the freezer going, plus a small fridge for essential, temp dependent medical supplies and power point for charging phones/power bank and other medical stuff. We’ve only had ours just over 12 months - put it in more for environmental reasons than financial, and because we get regular blackouts (more suicidal possum related than weather) - but it’s proven pretty worthwhile so far."
"I have a battery and my bills were about $300 a quarter in SA for about 750kwh. (we have high rates) I got an EV car, switched to a plan that has much cheaper off peak rates but higher peak rates. My last monthly bill was $40 and I used 550kwh. I charge the battery off solar and the grid during off peak rates to cover the peak rates. This is what most people don't do with a battery so the ROI is much higher"
"IMO, no, not yet I have a 10Kw system setup (13Kw panels with 10Kw inverter) its a pretty big house with lots of people, up in north Queensland, big aircons pumping hard, but dont have to worry about heaters in the winters Typical summer power bill is $100 per month, and i am expecting it to be $0 over winter months It doesnt produce enough to be self sufficient, if i did have a battery system, would definitely need a bigger system or an alternative power source to get through cloud days or weeks Doesnt leave much $$ for a battery system to be able to pay for itself in any good timeframe"
If you're in Melbourne right now. Worth every cent.
"Yep my parents are in North Central Victoria and they got through a 30h blackout period with zero issues due to their battery. They're retired so they don't save a huge amount of money with the battery as most of their use is during the day, but it kept them safe and connected while the whole town was out. It also gave their friends and neighbours a safe place to stay too. "
"No. Lets simplify the calculation. Say you installed a 10kwh battery. You pay 30c/kwh. In a perfect world you would store 10kwh each day, then use exactly 10kwh over night. So the maximum you could save is $3/day. However, I believe it's recommended to regularily use a max of 80%, so that turns into $2.4/day. I believe a 10kwh battery can cost around $16k installed. In perfect conditions it will take 18 years to pay back ($16k / $874 saved per year). With the $4k solar incentive that reduces to 13 years. Happy to be proven wrong though. I installed a 22.4 kw solar system for $13.4k that generates alot of power (100kwh/day on average). The payback period on that is looking to be 3 years (because i use alot of power during the day). So if you in my position a huge array makes far more economic sense. I think some of the shorter quoted X year battery payback relies heavily on the solar panels doing their thing, saving $$$ during the day."
"It's borderline. Straight payback is approx. 7-10 years, with battery life also around 10 years. However, if you factor in electricity price increases and the possibility of joining community battery projects to sell back to the grid at spot rates (like Tesla's Virtual Power Plant which also extends warranty to 15 years) then you are likely ahead over paying electricity bills, and with shorter payback. If you are in an area with access to a 0% interest green loan, and you can handle a 5-8 year payback, it works now."
"Solar on its own will pay for itself several times over, a battery will not."
"Yes if you have a foolproof 10 year warranty. Yes if the above and you can make use of TOU plans. Yes if you use lots of electricity. No if you just want to use power when is convenient. No if you buy a very expensive battery (but often the cheapies mean you can’t achieve point 1). For once in my life I had good timing in early 2020 and bought a 10kwh battery for about 5k. Through some changes in my electricity usage in the early evenings, and going on a TOU plan, it has been a financial win. Even more so after moving to Amber and charging the battery when it’s a negative price (ie on sunny, warm, and windy days they pay you to use electricity), and selling solar and stored battery power when the FIT is high. Plus a more common thing is to charge from the grid when the price is low and save it for when the price is high - as well as charging via solar."
"For every kWh of battery you install, you save about 17c worth of power when you cycle it. If the battery lasts 3000 cycles, that's $504 in savings. If the battery lasts 5000 cycles then you're saving $840. Most of the battery systems in Australia cost over $1200 per kWh installed, so they will never pay themselves back. There are some battery brands that have a retail price that is within payback. Pylontech US3000c 3.55kW batteries are about $550/kWh in bulk and are rated to 6000 cycles. Each kW installed should generate about $1008 in savings, if they last as long as they say. That also doesn't include installation costs. If you can get the batteries at a wholesale price and can install them for cheap, then it's definitely financially worthwhile."
Probably not for most. Solar is massively worthwhile - I have negative bills throughout the year now. In the dead of winter I have a small charge but the big credits from peak months more than cover it.
"For many, yes but a change in their plans and power usage is needed To make it worth it, you really have to take advantage of cheap times of power. A time of use plan saves you more than a flat rate E.g here in SA I am on a plan that's 54c peak rate, 33c shoulder and 8c off peak I charge my battery off the grid overnight to get me through the 3 hours it's 54c in the morning, before solar kicks in Then solar charges the battery during the day. If it's cloudy or raining and solar isn't covering our usage plus the battery, I'll charge off the grid during the 33c period (or the free period between 11 and 2pm)to cover the 54c between 3pm and midnight. I have basically zero usage during the peak times and my average kWh rate is 11c"
Not sure which energy retailer you are using but those prices are terrible.
"i think if you have the ability to maximise wholesale prices with Amber electric, then yes... Obviously there will be times that wholesale prices will kick you in the ass with extremely high prices - so you will need to have a large enough capacity to self sustain"
It depends. Don't listen to people who say they got a solar & battery system and having great returns. They'd be getting even better returns without the battery and battery ROI should be treated separately. https://www.solarquotes.com.au/battery-storage/payback/
"Last time I did a rough calculation, it still isn't worth it."
"A solar system with a battery needs to be larger than a solar system without one - as effectively you need to generate extra energy to store, to power the house at night. So, on top of the cost of batteries your solar system needs to be scaled up by at least %50. Too many people (my neighbour included) forget this, and have found the battery of limited utility, particularly in Winter. I have 2 Tesla Powerwall2's and they're AWESOME. We lost power for 14 hours in the Tuesday storms, but we were able to run the smaller aircon as needed, ran lighting, refrigeration, and even watched streaming TV (FTTP - never went out). Our summer electricity bills are negative, or only slightly positive (~$20), and we still shave 1/2 off our Winter bills. But the whole 12kW 2xbattery system cost about $40k, and there's no way the batteries will ever pay for themselves in dollar terms. But last Tuesday they sure did!!"
I'm about due a review of this. I commute in an EV so it's at work while the solar's doing its work and my wife's WFH for three days a week. Needing the AC through this Brisbane summer's been fairly costly (the Qld Govt rebates have been well timed!) but I'll have to sit down and run some numbers. Power costs are likely to drop over the coming 18 months with wholesale costs considerably reduced and retailers' 12 month contracts unwinding.
"Can't you charge at work? If there is no outlet at work, put a proposition into management to install charging station. Then they can bullshit how the company is green and saving the planet blah blah. They can take photos and put it on their website. Win win!! Even just a normal 10 amp outlet charging your car 8 hours a day 5 days a week is good. Slow charge is better."
If you're going to stay in your house for 10+ years and if you're a higher than average energy consumer then you can make the numbers work. Look into spot rates from people like Amber. There were stories on the Amber FB user group of people earning $500 in a few hours when the Victorian coal generators were offline earlier in the week. With spot rates and optimisation you can import on negative prices and export into price spikes to get ROI ata faster rate. That's not to say that it's a smart investment though. You're going to sink $15k+ into an asset that will hopefully cut your energy bill to nothing so your break even point is likely close to a decade away. Compared to just putting that 15k into a HISA at 5% you would have 24k in 10 years. IMO it depends quite heavily on how big an energy user you are. Big users have much more to gain.
"In my mind the key is power cost from grid during non solar generating times vs feed in. If grid cost is high and feed in is low, then it gets better and better to store in battery. Some places this difference is bigger, and the way things are going the difference is probably going to continue getting bigger. Doing calculations now on 10 year pay back might not show value, but what happens if you assume feed in continues to fall and gets to 1c, and grid increases to like 50c?"

I have a battery and solar and purposefully y chose a plan with a very low off peak rate and a very high peak rate. 8c off peak, 54c peak Moved all my high draw stuff to overnight if I can and I charge my car then too. Top up my battery @ 8c so I am not paying 54c in the morning before solar kicks in"
"Contemplated it but not worth it currently. With solar my bills have gone from $600 to $100 per quarter and the $100 is the ripoff daily supply charge ($1.19 per day with Energy Australia.). They do pay me 15c per kWh feed in tariff though. With a battery I'd still be paying the same bill unless I cut off from the grid which is not a good idea, as nice as that sounds. I know someone with an EV and solar, they don't even charge the car on solar as they have a deal with free power between midnight and 0300 so they charge the car then (set up with a timer)."
"For almost everybody, no."
"Another perspective. Think of it as an investment on your house. If you ever sell it with them on, this does increase resale values. A kitchen or bathroom renovation, a pool or even a decent landscaping will cost the same amount and you don't question the return on investment. The generally last the same amount of time too."
Wait till EVs come with V2H capability. EV doubles up as home battery for WFH folks
"QLD state government just announced $3,000-$4000 rebates on 6kwh battery systems. If I'm paying 26c/kwh and 5c/kwh feed-in, does any battery system make sense? Could I get a battery system that averages <21c/kwh just in wear & tear?"
The one benefit of a battery is when the grid goes down you don’t. All the sweet solar you can actually use in the middle of the day.
"It depends, I guess. If you're forced to use substantial amounts of power overnight, for whatever reason, then yes. I don't have a battery and I'm hardly paying for power."
