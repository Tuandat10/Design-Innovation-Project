"Ausgrid, which has about 280,000 customers in New South Wales with rooftop solar panels, has introduced a two-way tariff system to incentivise solar panel owners to export their power into the grid in the evening, when it is most needed. That 'evening peak' is between 1600 and 2100. What the fuck are solar systems exporting during that period? You'd need a battery system in order to do that, and if you're doing that, the proposed export rates are so low that there's almost no incentive to do so. You'd be better off exporting nothing and keeping it all for yourself. That's ignoring the cost of the battery which are still expensive. I agree that the overinflated export prices that some people enjoyed were a joke, but there shouldn't be anything charged to people exporting to the grid when a lot of those plans have higher base supply charges anyway. I've had home solar to offset my energy usage (mostly air conditioning, night shift worker), with exporting being a nice little bonus but not the primary reason. If it's that much of a burden, don't offer an export payment."
"I am part of the trial, which ends on the 1st of July. The trial boosted FiT times are 2pm to 8pm, and it gives a bonus 25c per kWh on top of existing FiT. I have a battery and pay wholesale prices, so am often getting around 80c per kWh (ignoring spikes, where I get $3 per kWh and over) from dumping my battery into the grid in the evening. The new version is heavily nerfed and overall not worth opting into."
It's more expensive to install a system with a power meter so it can limit exports - my dodgy installer didn't put one in 3 years ago because I didn't realise it wasn't included.
The problem is supply exceeding demand. So companies encourage you to reduce supply. The best solution is for households to combine battery storage with solar panels. Every change re solar panels seems to be pushing adoption of batteries
"The best solution is for households to combine battery storage with solar panels. If only that solution was even remotely financially viable. The batteries don't save you enough money in their warranty period to pay for themselves, let alone any profit."
"exactly, supply and demand 101. the fact that solar is cheap and plentiful should be hailed as a good thing. but when the layman sees that it being cheap and plentyful means the value of electricity they are trying to sell during the day is 0 or negative then all of a sudden its a bad thing. batteries arent yet financially viable, but having appliances that can turn on during the day is an easy way the layman can save with solar"
Let them get away with it and the price they charge will go up and up. The 1.2c charge per kWH is just to normalise charging you.
"I mean, if you told me 5 years ago that my solar investment would be generating 0 dollars or in fact costing me money to feed it back into the grid. I probably wouldn’t have bothered to get the system installed. Most roi calculators are based on the information people currently have on hand. So it’s a bit rich to do a full 180 on it. Completely understand why network operators are doing it, but a long notice period for people to adjust their systems or usage would be a bare minimum that they could do."
People did tell you 5 years ago that FIT would trend towards zero as solar expanded. There were already days of negative prices for commercial solar farms years before that.
"Our electricity prices have doubled from the same time last year, This is nothing more than more cooperate greed and price gouging. Like it says in the article ""I’m not going to be generating much power after 6 or 7pm in summer, and not much after 5pm in winter"" This is all about making more money for the energy company. This is something the government need to step in and stop. Prices cant just keep going up indefinitely people cant afford to live, and now there finding away to charge customers more who have solar. They not trying to do anything but line there pockets. This is what happens when you privities its all about profit and nothing else."
"Unpopular opinion, but you absolutely should be charged for exporting at peak ""solar generation"" times. Home solar systems need to have the correct metering so exports can be restricted. During summer days in Australia the wholesale energy price can reach -$0.20 per kWh. Not a typo - NEGATIVE twenty cents. As in, wholesale providers will be paid to consume energy, and charged for exporting it. Too much energy being pumped into the grid causes problems with electrical infrastructure. "
Sounds like the providers would profit from building some batteries huh?
"That is their problem. If they no longer wish to do it, they can sell their investment back to the people."
"Exactly - the energy market isn't a profit measure, it's an engineering measure to make sure supply and demand are matched and shit doesn't explode. Excess power is toxic and so damn straight you should be charged to have the grid take it away. Or you can do the thing they want you to do and stop exporting!"
I don't know the exact numbers but if they're paying you like 2c for your power and selling it to other people at 20 or 30c how the F do they have the gall to charge you for doing that? Like they're not making enough already? And don't forget elec prices jumped up around 40% the start of last financial year.
There's a lot of extra work the resellers factor in when exporting solar. Things like being slimy cunts and carrying the 1. Sometimes they have to update their webpage so that it shows the most recent news from 2003. It all adds up.
"The distributors role is running the poles and wires, they aren’t the ones charging you money for your usage, you fundamentally misunderstand the situation"
"SA has had a month of calm, mild, sunny weather. Interestingly, it has also been a very expensive month for electricity wholesale costs. Solar is not providing enough power to make things properly cheap. Solar is about 90% the output of peak summer time, but power consumption/demand is probably only at about 60-70%, due to there being less need to heat/cool homes and businesses. So I don’t completely buy the ‘there’s too much domestic solar in the grid’ line any more. It seems wind is what the grid needs to be sustainable and at times over-supplied."
Don't we export like 2/3rds of our total production? This entire industry is a god damn scam.
so power companies admit they have surplus supply during the day? why are the rates going up then? or is this just in time to capture the energy rebate?
"Calm down everyone, this is for wholesale pricing, some retailers will pass on the costs whilst some will absorb it no different to how everyone retailer has different feed in tariffs. “A spokesperson for Ausgrid said a typical solar customer should see an increased cost of 13 cents a week or $6.60 a year.” Can we actually read the article first ?"
Why the fuck wont this country invest in storage solutions like molten sands and other technologies like that. we have so much excess no and no one is bothering to try and store it. batteries wont be enough.
This is just greed. Let's charge people who invested in solar to bring down their power bills as they aren't paying us enough. Why don't they instead pay us to use electricity when supply is exceeding demand. I'm sure EV owners would love to pop the car on charge during the day which could increase demand significantly. 
"if you're with retailers like Amber you do get paid, but on the flip side you can get slugged +$10/kw if price spikes"
There are retailers that will work exactly like this. But expect to pay through the nose when demand is exceeding supply.
