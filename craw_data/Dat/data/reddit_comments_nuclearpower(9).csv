"I am, in general, pro-nuclear, and globally it should be part of the solution going forward. But Hinkley Point C, in the UK, started construction in 2017, it's not expected to finish until 2029 at the earliest and will cost, if nothing else goes wrong, $80 billion Australian, and they have plenty of experience with this. It is just preposterously impractical for us to be going down this road any time soon. I've seen claims about the UAE being able to stand up a reactor comparatively quickly and cheaply but, y'know, we don't exactly have a large underclass of actual slaves to deploy down here to drive costs down."
"Barakah was about $30-$34 Billion AUD for 5,600MW of capacity and was largely on time and budget, maybe 10% over budget not bad as they managed to get it done before COVID slapped all other projects to hell. But also, yes, as you noted worker deaths and workers being paid were of no great concern for the UAE."
"Who does he imagine will provide the capital to build them? Won't be Federal government because the ALP opposes this policy and the LNP don't do infrastructure investment. Won't be business or super funds because the payback period is too long. Maybe the State governments? Actually, I have a sneaking suspicion he doesn't intend to do anything about this in his first or second terms as PM, it's just a talking point to win some votes."
Labor and greens would block lifting the nuclear ban anyway. So it’s never going to happen and he has an easy out. In the end the Libs won’t have to do anything and can blame labor for the failure. Pure political posturing
The Federal government can easily fund building nuclear power plants. Whether it should is another question. But if the Federal government can fund a 40+Bn per year NDIS it can fund 10Bn a year on building nuclear power. The current Federal government budget is ~600Bn a year.
"A few thoughts: One of the biggest threats to this proposal is the cost trajectory of renewables and storage continuing to lower while the commercial realities of government funded large scale infra have not improved with cost blowouts of 100-200% remaining common. The other challenge is that while the government may choose to fund this, for the proposal to remain on track you would need back to back LNP governments with state backing all the way to 2040, which is simply not realistic. Government would need to tap debt capital markets to raise the funds but the major banks, super funds and insurers will need big pricing incentives to account for the governance issues this brings if they can even stomach it at all. That would blow costs right out. More realistic is the release of this proposal purely as a wedge issue with the coalition likely to stay in the wilderness or perhaps a minority government for the foreseeable future and unable to drive this forward."
Who's going to insure it? The build the financing and the running of.
"I didn't want to state this in the opening comment as I am speculating, which given Dutton only talks about having two plants up and running by 2035/2037 it looks to me like the intention may just be to acquire the sites that are planned for closure soon like Muja and Callide B to keep them running indefinitely whilst trying to build actual reactors at the closed sites like Port Augusta and Liddell. I also don't want to go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole, I would like to see if this can be made to work. I can't make nuclear power economical in any way shape or form that doesn't involve stupid levels of corner cutting or technology that has just been round the corner for more than 70 years."
"Those plants need to close. The current state and federal governments want to keep the thermal plants running for longer, but the older ones are literally falling apart with tube damage both in and outside the boiler. More aggressive load ramping has accelerated the wear. Going forward plants will probably be brought online/offline to match demand - further causing issues with the boiler and turbine. There comes a point where the operators won't continue to operate their units because the risk of a catastrophic steam leak or other failure becomes too high. If you're running a plant that's expected to close in 3 years, you'll allow it to limp along until that date (maintenance costs are still high as things are failing). Then imagine the government tells you to run for another 4 years - you have to recalculate the odds of plant failing in the period beyond the planned lifetime and fund additional maintenance or upgrades to continue going."
How has nuclear power been just around the corner for 70 years ? It has been delivering low C02 emission electricity for decades. France's electricity production is 53 gms or C02 for every killowatt and the place is 93% low carbon electricity. From : https://app.electricitymaps.com/map - yearly average. What country has similar low emission electricity from renewables unless they have heaps of hydro or geothermal ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_renewable_electricity_production Also - for cost comparison. Germany has spent an estimated EUR 696 bn on the Energiewende. Their emissions are 400 g / kilowatt and 63% renewable : ( from electricity maps - yearly average ) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14786451.2024.2355642
"Given the way things are built here to such stringent standards, not sure if we could ever build them. The following I found in online articles. 'The recent history of nuclear power construction in the U.S. provides a useful point of comparison. Only a single nuclear power plant has been completed in the U.S. in the last 30 years: the two-unit Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Tennessee, which required 23 years for one reactor to be operational and 33 years for the other. What’s more, the two most recent nuclear projects under construction — the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant and the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station — received approval in 2012 from the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), and are both over budget and far from completing construction. For instance, a revised cost forecast for the Vogtle plant projects a total project cost of $25 billion, which is a 75 percent increase over its original $14.3 billion estimate.' Solar vs. Nuclear: Comparing Carbon-Free Power Sources | EnergySage and this 'However, the cost of nuclear power itself doesn’t need to be as high as it is in the United States. Japanese nuclear power plants only take an average of three to four years to build, from pouring concrete foundation to grid connection. French power plants mostly took between five and eight years to build. American plants used to be built at a similar pace, before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began to regulate the most minute aspects of construction. Contemporary American nuclear plants commonly take over a decade to build (assuming the construction plan is not simply abandoned). The NRC has a 32-step construction licensing process, and many of those steps require approval from other regulatory agencies that impose their own multi-step approval processes.'

"Vogtle 3 is finished and Vogtle 4 is almost completed as well, both massively over budget. It's the same in Finland with Olkiluoto 3, late and well over budget."
"Do we even want to is the real question. According to the CSIRO report: Between $73 and $128/MWh for renewables. vs Between $141 to $233/MWh for regular nuclear and $230 to $382/MWh for small modular reactors. The sensible thing seems to be to go down the renewables path to me. Spend half the amount, get results starting now (not in 15+ years) and take advantage of technology advancements as we go too. We're a country absolutely bathing in renewable energy and we should take advantage of it."
It's worth asking the question: even when we are sure the answer is absolutely not worth it.
"Yep the explanation is the same as usual: the P in LNP stands for puppet and someone has their arm firmly up Dutt’s back passage making his lips move in predictably pointless ways. They know it is a dumb idea better than most, because they’ve had to dress it up to seem realistic to dopey voters. But it’s purely wedge politics, and a poor example."
It's either flat out idiocy or criminal corruption leading the country in a wild goose chase. Nothing else makes sense.
Peter mutton. Enough said.
