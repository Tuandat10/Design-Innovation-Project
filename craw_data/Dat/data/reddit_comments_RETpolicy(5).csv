Nice! I'm wondering if there are stats out there to see if the number of fossil fuel vehicles and homes using fossil fuel heating/cooking have been going down.
"Vehicles in Australia have been sluggish so far in shifting to electric. Optimistically the rapid rise may have started about 3 years ago but we're still talking only tens of thousands of new EVs a year for the moment. About half of South Australian households use gas for hot water, very few use it for heating, can't find figures for cooking. Most gas in South Australia is currently for electricity generation so if that goes it'll massively drop overall gas use in the state."
"Most homes have solar on their own roofs... EV's are just starting there, but low rates from surplus solar should speed EV adoption.."
"Is this 100% renewable electricity or energy? Cause' a lot of transportation, industry, heating, & feedstock are dependent on fossil fuels. I doubt Australia can reach a complete energy transition so quickly."
"It's electricity. SA is most of the way there on that front, electricity consumption there was about 72% renewable generation and 12% imports in 2023, and 75% of generation in the state was renewables (all solar and wind, no hydro). The imports were probably about one third renewable on average, just going by the mix in the rest of the national grid."
"Definitely electricity- it’s the first step. Once you’re at a 100% renewables grid, one of the hallmarks of a stable system will be frequent large surpluses of electricity, as you build the system around having enough during low wind/sun period, and the rest of the time will see major excess generation. Capitalism will see those surpluses and ask “how can we make some cash with this?” followed by rapid innovation into ways to use that surplus as an essentially free input into what had been fossil fuel driven processes."
"Electricity, I'm sure."
👏👏👏👏👏
"Great progress. Next step would be to get to ""true"" 100 pct, where they phase out electricity imports and gas use entirely through renewable overbuilding & batteries."
"I think that's largely up to the people responsible for NSW, Queensland and Victoria's ongoing transitions. Not really the responsibility of South Australia. They will only overbuild to the extent they can usefully export it."
"BOOM!!! “There is no doubt we will get to net 100 per cent renewables before 2030,” energy minister Tom Koutsantonis said a statement. “So we are doubling down on our ambition. We want to get there even sooner. “The global price shocks of 2022 proved that we must strengthen our own supply and resilience to external pressures.“"
