"We choose to do this and the other thing, not because it is easy but because it is hard. Coward"
"Just fundamentally... Electric fuel infrastructure - easy Liquid fuel infrastructure -hard Gas fuel infrastructure -very hard Same reason almost all houses are connected to an electrical grid, most houses are connected to a water grid, and some houses are connected to a natural gas grid. It's just the nature of those substances. It's way easier to keep electrons in a wire, than to keep a gas in a metal tube."
Because it only exists to enable more fossil fuels burning It doesn't work. It doesn't even really exist. It's a lightshow to distract people.
"Why Almost Nobody Is Buying Audi. The vast majority of projects don't have a single customer stepping up to buy the vehicle. OK, the title mixes up the Audi factory with the Audi vehicle. Why. All porduced Hydrogen is easily sold and in China there are constant complaints that not enough is being produced."
"The main argument for H2 is that it can be produced at low cost when renewable assets (wind & solar) are overproducing. The electrolyzers would be a perfect electricity sink. Since many industrial processes (fertilizer is a large consumer) require H2 and take it from natural gas now, renewable H2 production would reduce the carbon footprint of the fertilizer industry dramatically. So much for the theory. The reality is that the electrolyzers built now, need to run 100% of the time to become 'profitable', which is still at way higher prices than natural-gas based H2. With this application, H2 production will be consuming much needed electricity for heat pumps, electric cars and other assets much needed to replace fossil-fuel based solutions. It's competition you just don't want. Also, the overproduction by renewable assets is so interesting (free power!) that many other industries have set up power sinks like e-boilers to consume this overproduction. So the base case is unrealistic and current set-up unprofitable. H2 is needed, for sure. But it won't be viable unless: electrolyzers get way cheaper overproduction is much more common (which means there's much more renewable production) Imo, we should put this tech on hold for ten years or so (longer outside of EU) until the point that we have 60-80% renewable power. It's currently hurting the transition more than helping it."
"I thought the main argument for H2 was the decarbonization of historically hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as steelmaking. Electricity won’t be able to fill every niche."
"The main argument for H2 is that it can be produced at low cost when renewable assets (wind & solar) are overproducing. The electrolyzers would be a perfect electricity sink. An as you correctly stated the 'main argument' is bogus. It will never be cost effective to build expensive electrolyzer, pipeline and storage systems that sit idle most of the time and depend on intermittent, sporadic and unpredictable bursts of ""free"" energy that can be curtailed at any time as the grid is upgraded. That argument is more of an excuse to get uninformed people to look past the obvious economic problems with green hydrogen. And the promises of widespread adoption in transportation, energy production and heating are also largely bogus. Not surprisingly the fossil fuel industry is behind most of the hydrogen hype and is seemingly the main beneficiary of all the public money being spent chasing this folly."
"Yes, the idea of running a business on 'free power' from variable renewable sources is a flawed one. 'Free power' will just go away once the storage industry (thermal or batteries) catches up. They will make a business buying power (or heat/cold) when it's cheap and selling it when its needed. This in turn will lead to power plants no longer having any kind of curtailment year round. Industries that only run intermittently aren't profitable vs. the ones that go 24/7 - even when they get their power for free (maybe bitcoin mining?)"
"Pushed by the gov, paid by the gov, purchased by the gov, until the gov run out of money and it’s back to square one. That’s my observation with h2 in the last 10 years. At this time I am more inclined to say ammonia holds more promise than hydrogen, especially when combined with a smr to produce it locally."
I agree but... guess what you need to make green ammonia?
Props to Michael Liebreich who has been calling out the hydrogen delusions for many years.
"I went down this rabbit hole recently. Arguably at small scale trying to find a fuel cell large enough to augment my home inverter, and keep a larger amount of stored energy over days, and not a day like my lithium battery. What I found at least at small scale was: The really efficient (95%) electrolysers like Hysata are not available to average consumers yet. I could not find anyone that could even cost a decent fuel cell for me. They are rare at the smaller scale. There are really promising methods for storing hydrogen in fixed applications like metal hydrides, which are heavy, but really efficient, safe, and low pressure with low explosive risk. These are not readily available for consumers though, and very expensive still. Fuel cells still have a way to go in efficiency (<50%) but my use case didn't really care (using my excess solar capacity that would go to waste). My hope was to be able to store a week worth of energy at a fraction of the cost (the fuel cell stays the same size, and you just add tanks). Didn't pan out though, and I think we are a way off still before it becomes more popular. The question is whether it will always be behind battery tech tho? Sodium ion batteries... flow batteries... all of these technologies may actually mature and bring cost down quicker than fuel cells, especially because they are very low complexity (no pipes or compressors). Pity as I would be really keen on having a battery for a 24-48 hr storage, then hydrogen or some other form of cheaper storage even at lower kW for medium term storage (I.e. collect on sunny days and dispatch in rainy days)"
It’s a scam to begin with.
"I think it needs to be larger scale. Significantly excess green energy converted to H2, and then when the renewable isn't available for whatever reason it gets turned back into electricity for the grid until the renewables return in enough to refill the H2. Could also potentially use the excess H2 in cars if there was a way to store and ship it so it can be sold at places similar to gas stations, but kinda like propane tanks? Pop and swap H2 cells. Would have to be a massive project, and would naturally be full of cost delays, overruns, etc etc. probably not feasible without a way to cut through all the red tape of government"
"Marine shipping is going to be a customer (but large or small? time will tell) for ammonia. They maybe could use liquid H2 but ammonia is easier. Concrete, that is Portland Cement, may find a green version, signs are hopeful. Steel and hot industrial processes- burn H2 for heat : requires pipeline or rail cars, and a new source of green H2. use electricity for heat: big grid connection; electric steel mills are a mature tech. The green H2 is probably made from green electricity, so may as well use the electricity directly. H2 is a difficult gas, and tends to leak. Electrical resistance and arc heating is not the most elegant solution, but it is the quickest way to the goal, and looks more straightforward than H2."
"I’ve been saying every chance I get for two years: green Hydrogen is a scam. It’s inefficient to create, inefficient to store, inefficient to transport, not even all that great when it comes time to burn it. But (and here’s the scammy part), if you can establish a customer base, and a transport infrastructure for hydrogen (using “green” subsidies from the government), all of a sudden, big oil will step in and says ‘hey - we can supply cheaper brown hydrogen for your needs’ using the same (already paid for) infrastructure."
H2 as a storage gas sucks. It’s not energy dense at all and leaks easy.
Tbh green hydrogen is great but the real issue is the cost of energy. Without super cheap energy green hydrogen will be too expensive to become popular. The green transition will hopefully help with this but only if governments push power companys to actually build generation.
"It makes zero sense to use green hydrogen to generate electricity. It takes far more electricity to produce it than it would ever return. And it's not just the cost of electricity that makes it uneconomical to produce. Electrolyzer plants, pipelines, storage, etc are expensive too."
"Just my two cents, all “green” combustible energy sources are a hard sell right now. Our society has revolved around combustion for over 100 years now and there’s an underlying theme that society wants to pursue non-combustible options."
"This green hydrogen project, which is due to commence construction shortly, has signed two customers already: South Australian government signs hydrogen deal with Whyalla steelworks. One of the customers is the plant itself, the other is the Whyalla steelworks just down the road. The green hydrogen is to be made using excess renewable energy from the overbuild (overcapacity) of the local renewable energy grid. This excess energy is available perhaps 40% of the time at give-away prices."
"So…one customer probably. Whyalla Steelworks is owned by GFG, infamous the world over for having no money, and being in default to govts. "
"If cracked methane or ammonia is cheaper, why would I want to go with the more expensive option? Can somebody explain to me why hydrogen is viable?"
"I think the main selling point is that, when burned, the byproduct is water and they thus think it's the cleanest fuel out there. Most supporters of hydrogen don't look beyond that it seems. It's terribly inefficient to make hydrogen through electrolysis, wasting the majority of the energy. Any other use of that energy is much better. For example, why run a car on hydrogen and loose 70% of the energy, when that same energy can be charging an EV and only loose <20%. Also, there's just isn't enough green hydrogen made, less than 1% is green. The majority is created during reforming of fossil fuels. Which sounds like a good thing, because of it being a byproduct, but it's still requires compression and other things. That means it's, at the very best, twice as inefficient than direct charging. Also, it's not renewable being a byproduct of fossil fuels, because fossil fuels aren't."
Exactly. I don’t understand why people don’t understand this.
"Every technology goes through a hype phase. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle Fuel cells had theirs. Hydrogen is in a hype phase because the Senate Energy Committee funded it, along with carbon capture. Leibrich, founder of a new energy financing consultancy, bought by Bloomberg to become Bloomberg NEF is promoting hydrogen. It is too early to tell how effective green hydrogen will be and for what purposes."
"one banana, two banana......."
"Leibrich literally invented the ""hydrogen ladder"" which is notable for calling out the majority of current hydrogen use cases as pure bullshit. I don't think you can put this hype cycle on him."
"Leibrich, founder of a new energy financing consultancy, bought by Bloomberg to become Bloomberg NEF is promoting hydrogen. Lol, wut? Michael Liebreich has been spending years saying how stupid most of the hydrogen plans are."
Federal government will have to be the major off-taker for at least a decade for the industry to scale. ITCs and subsidies are not enough to get the American utilities or C&Is to take on the risk.
"The federal government is already paying producers to make it. I don't anticipate that paying them again to buy the product, for which there is no commercial market, will ever fly."
"Green hydrogen isnt mass produced yet (although China may be doing it). Most stuff is in the scaling stage such as hysr, or pilot program stages with green ammonia for farms etc A lot of projects are waiting EU or other funding. Article appears to be misleading or confusing “green/blue/grey/black hydrogen” as “green hydrogen” Also fuel cells are still being tuned such as teco 2030 for maritime industry. Stuff takes time to test, pilot, scale, mass production, regularions etc"

I have a couple of beans to sell you too
