"Here’s the product of years of wind/solar/storage build in South Australia. Note wind abandons the grid regularly. Storage completely inadequate. Not fully decarbonized by a long shot. https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=30m&view=discrete-time In the same time this was built out the UAE built the Barakah nuclear power station. The output of half of that plant could fully decarbonize South Australia’s grid, and they’d be exporting tons of zero carbon energy to the rest of Australia on top of that. So no, nuclear isn’t “too slow.” :)"
"Now that you say it, I investigated and Barakah was built in 12 years and probably provides ~44 TWh/year (assuming 90% cf). That's more than all solar combined in Australia in 2023 according to Electricity maps lol (solar was 42.1 TWh). Obviously they could've made their grid cleaner more quickly had they began nuclear in the past, but does it make sense to start now, considering nuclear is banned and all? Or are they too far gone the renewable route that changing course might be worse? https://app.electricitymaps.com/zone/AU"
Not building nuclear in Australia guarantees fossil fuels will be apart of their energy grid indefinitely. That’s why the gas companies are pushing hard for this plan. They will make billions.
"Also, the methane leakage is a killer for expected greenhouse gas reductions when using gas for backup."
"In 2007, the Australian Labour Party ran campaign ads that said, not only ""nuclear will destroy the coal industry"", but ""the solution to climate change is to burn more coal"". https://imgur.com/gallery/nuclear-power-will-kill-coal-industry-4XSo739 The Royal Commission a few years back concluded that establishing a nuclear power industry would not be economically viable under existing electricity market rules. Of course, those rules are can be changed!"
Not if Australia wants reliable power that is in human control. Australia also has the world's largest reserves of uranium yet refuses to use it. Wind droughts are inevitable.
"Unfortunately, and stupidly, there is still a complete ban on everything nuclear in Australia (except uranium mining). So that would have to be overturned by the Federal government first, and there is zero chance of that...especially as the LNP (opposition party) is now making a big deal of nuclear (and fk the LNP. They were, until recently, in power for 10 years and did fk all about nuclear so they are using it as a wedge issue)."
"If I recall correctly, for 3 days last week there was a complete wind drought on the Eastern coast of Australia so at night time there was of course zero solar but zero wind as well. All power was from fossil fuels except for a little hydro. Firming is definitely either incredibly large scale battery or nuclear if fossil fuels are to be avoided. There is a grow positive sentiment for nuclear in Australia partly driven by https://www.nuclearforaustralia.com/"
I do wish that they'd mention how often the renewables will not be producing that 90%.
"Regrettably we in Australia will have to find out the hard way. But the way really weird situation is that we have anti-nuclear policies for power generation, but we are building nuclear powered submarines! try and get your mind around that conundrum! Australia: the most anti-nuclear, nuclear submarine defended country in the world !!!!"
"I find the claim extremely dubious that in 10 years Australia is going to effectively rebuild their entire energy production infrastructure (especially because I'm pretty sure those projection are already off, and I think it's probably in the publishers interest to make bold claims like that) but regardless, a nuclear plant generally takes less than 9 years to build, and what about the other 10%? beside nuclear compliments other renewables well in that: other renewables are to sporadic, but nuclear is too predictable for changing energy needs throughout a day. Nuclear ought to be used to meet the lows of energy demand, to reduce dependance on highly toxic lithium ion batteries."
"Wow, that's a great piece of propaganda. The first problem is the assumption that we ( Australia ) will be 90% renewables by 2033. I call bullshit. Utter bullshit. The capacity factors for renewables are around 40%. That fact is just swept away like it matters not at all. Yet it is the crux of the matter. We. Do. Not. Have. Cheap. Grid. Scale. Storage. This means that 60% will be filled by something. It will be either gas, coal, or nuclear. It won't be batteries. It won't be hydro ( How is Snowy 2.0 going again?) We have a choice between heavy CO2 emitters and nuclear. That's it. We should stop pretending that we can shove coal off the grid with wishful thinking."
"Yeah lol I thought the same, no way they could get 90% nevermind 100% only with solar + wind + batteries for a country that has no small electricity demand (around 230 TWh for 2023). I found hard to believe what was said in the video and that's why I made the post."
So how will nuclear make money in the middle of the day when electricity prices are so low? Cycle your nuclear plant up and down?
"...sorry, what's the existential crisis we're facing? Is it carbon emissions or running out of money? Either way, nuclear power would be better in the long term. Firstly for a stable, consistent, and controllable supply of clean energy, rather than being at the mercy of the weather, see the charts in other comments on this thread about what the weather's been delivering lately. And on price, a set number of big plants that only need replacing every half feckin' century will be cheaper long term than an endless number of wind turbines, solar panels and batteries that still don't fully replace fossil fuels."
Is it expensive to curtail solar power?
"Cycle your nuclear plant up and down? France does it to a limited extent, but only for intermediate demand, not peak demand."
