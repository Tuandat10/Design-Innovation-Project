"Watch the grifters and rent seekers slither out from cracks in the ground to gobble up more of that sweet tax payers money. We all know this is nothing but billion dollar taxpayer funded labor reelection campaign. There is no way using current technology Australia could manufacture a solar panel and magically it would somehow be cheaper then what they do in China where all the toxic waste can get dumped in a river and the employees can get paid next to nothing while they get next to no entitlements and work in a workplace not encumbered by such things as safety laws. This weekend is a classic example example of why Australia can not compete. Four public holidays in a row. A huge burden on businesses as some employees will also ""pull a sickie"" to add a few more days to their holiday as they know they are untouchable."
"by grifters you mean NDIS companies and Childcare centres. Childcare used to be run out of converted houses and people's backyards, now we have 3 in my area that could be confused with HQ's for corporate giants. Custom-built monstrosities to take in as many kids as possible to suck up more money than jobseeker costs taxpayers."
"White elephant incoming! The hubris of the Australian Government to think we can compete in such a commoditised market when half the Chinese manufacturers can't even stay in business and make a profit. This will be a total waste of tax payer money, but I'm sure they know that and it's all optics."
There is a market for stuff not made in china.
"Well, digging coal out of the ground is a waste of taxpayer money with the number of tax exemption the coal industry gets. So, hunter might as well waste our money on our stuff."
"Could be a seperate topic but funny how there is a monster uptake in solar panels but energy prices still seem to go up, and energy companies basically pay you nothing now to give them energy to make profit on. Nah nah totally normal"
This! They could have chosen to do something to push up the rebates (amounts users get for sending power to the grid) but instead we get this policy which is light on details and experts already predict will achieve very little because it won’t compete in terms of price with the Chinese made panels
"Well, for those who buy solar panels, the prices go down...a lot. Those who don't buy panels face increased prices. Similarly, if you buy a battery and store the energy you generate during the day, you save the full price of power at night. If you try to sell power during the day, when everyone else is generating you aren't going to get a good price. Pretty much classic market behaviour right there."
"I think most are missing the point here, and tbh, I think this is a great move. This isn’t about competing with China on cheap panels. If you zoom out and read the writing on the wall, it’s to counter an energy security issue should China, one day decide not to supply solar panels to us. Dependence on China for our energy is a huge conundrum especially at a time where; it’s apparent that China is in the midst of a military buildup to be able to take on the US, the production of chips is required to be a global super power and tensions over Taiwan are boiling over. We have already seen China flex on us over Bali and wheat exports. It’s clear now that our government has finally woken up to risks associated with Chinese dependence and the coercive power it affords china. Over time, advances in automation and robotics will make Australian panels competitive. In the short term, it is a means of securing energy generation at a time that coal fired power plants are closing down one by one and our demand for power is increasing."
"Odd to the comments bagging this out, any investment into solar tech is a good idea and to have our own industry as well is even better. Now if only they invested in more renewable tech."
"Sometimes I’m amazed at the defeatism in the Australian psyche. It’s all flag waving on Anzac Day but when it comes to actually making something we’re all, too small a population, unions will make it too expensive, we don’t have the technology. Labour rates are not the killer they once were. Robots in manufacturing mean many factories employ far fewer people and it’s more about markets and resources, both of which in this case are local. China cannot do anything we can’t do, there is no secret ingredient."
"Good start. How about they also invest in Australian made double glazing units rather than relying on imports - that would reduce energy costs significantly over time,"
Australian made solar panels is such a no brainer. We have all the resources and capability to build them and at a higher quality than Chinese made. The cost of building them has plummeted while demand is increasing. Australia is also a prime country for solar energy and would also benefit exporting overseas. I'm shocked its taken so long to invest harder into them.
While I’m supportive of Australian made and renewables to a point I would have preferred at least some of the funding to go to storage. Too much solar is actually a bad thing if there’s no use for the electricity solar produces.
I actually think there's more potential for Australia to develop different types of battery than to compete with China producing solar panels. Probably won't compete with them producing lithium based batteries either but there's lots of battery chemistries out there.
"Lol, the ALP can't win! At least they are doing something - it should reduce panel pricing at the very least"
"Only 1??? It’s a good start but bloody hell; compare how much we give to fossil fuels in subsidies and it doesn’t look great; 2022-23 we gave them $11 billion. Im sure we put a small figure into other renewables too, but it won’t hit $11b. Puts it into perspective. Should be the other way around really; subsidise good sources we want and leave the bad ones to die in the free market their supporters on the right like to moan about incessantly"
"Jolly good show! Do this, batteries and prefabricated housing and we can get on a good footing for what is going to be a tough 50 years."
"A good move. Panels are an essential item we can't live without. We absolutely need them and overly complex chains are not sustainable in the long term - they are already under incredible strain and beginning to fall apart, quite sperate from the whole China thing. And it's only going to get worse. We need be self reliant on stuff like this."
"Impeccable timing once again on display by the leadership of this country. Seeing as modern PV solar panels were invented in Australia in the 80’s, we are about 40 years too late on this one. This isn’t a dig at Albo but the dysfunction of the Australian government. We also don’t have a semiconductor manufacturing industry in this country. I don’t have much confidence that an undeveloped economy like ours can go from mining and realestate to produce competitive, high quality semiconductors. I would think we would need billions in investment to create a whole new industry over decades that can support manufacturing of solar panels and the likes."
The blame for the delay lies solely on John Howard and his government. They pushed out the PV industry that could have made Australia a world leader.
"We also don’t have a semiconductor manufacturing industry in this country.  It's interesting to compare what Australia has achieved spending money propping up the mining industry, while Taiwan instead decided to set up TSMC and has such a monopoly on the market that it's an effective insurance policy to prevent China from invading."
This is a good policy I am in favour of. The status quo leaves us at an utter reliance on Chinese supply chains for solar power (and broader energy security) along with ethical concerns about Uyghur slave labour. Hopefully this venture succeeds.
"Claims ""slave labour"" and then shows a photo of people in a classroom. The media, ladies and gentlemen."
China has allready 'solved' this problem. We are decades behind. Why compete in a race to the bottom on profitability on a product that has already been made cheap as chips? We should be subsidising something that china hasn't already mastered.
"Well it’s entirely fair that you say that, because the government is not being straight up about what this really is. It’s about jobs in the Hunter sure, but it is also a hedge against the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait. A conflict which would be to no one’s real benefit, as it would disrupt a large proportion of global trade, and an even larger proportion of Australia’s. And the free flow of China’s PV exports would be in amongst all that. (Some analysts at Bloomberg put the global cost in the ballpark of $10 trillion, way beyond the Iraq war or even COVID.) So yeah Australia is just one of many countries including India, the US and half of ASEAN who have developed a pretty sudden interest in their solar supply chains right now. Because reasons."
"How about not being reliant on China and having the expertise on shore to create jobs, etc?"
I’m skeptical how feasible domestic solar panel production is here if German production is not competitive. But if there’s a good actual business case for it then I suppose I support this.
How much more energy is captured from an Australian solar system(annually) in comparison with an equivalent one in Germany/Europe? Is that why the European solar manufacturers went bust? I’ve heard 6-12 times less energy than Australia solar system.
"cool, they will look great on the carboard I'll be living in because you have done next to nothing about the housing problem."
The cardboard will be stronger after installation
You are not the only one scratching your head when it comes to albos priorities and seeming lack of action on housing
Could just buy 1 billion in cheap Chinese solar panels. We can't compete with them on wages so seems doomed to fail?
"“The Prime Minister's office said in a statement that ""ARENA will look at the entire supply chain"" in the solar manufacturing space, and how the government can provide grants to boost domestic solar-technology innovation.” So it seems more a fund to support innovation in the area rather than large scale manufacturing to compete with China."
We can use technology to diminish that Chinese competitive advantage by utilising automation and robotics. Having stuff built in Australia is important and we should seek to increase sovereign manufacturing wherever we can.
"SURE, Lets rely on chinese quality control for large infrastructure projects."
Don't you want independence from a foreign power and having the expertise on the technology on shore? You want to be completely dependent on China?
"oh awesome, so am i supposed to buy these in the hope of getting a house to buy one day? seems a bit backward"
So the other ~10 million dwellings miss out because of you? Do people here EVER think about the broader picture?
Put one on your hat.
There is more to life than home ownership  The government can do multiple things simultaneously housing is not really the federal government’s problem so yell at your state and local government and stop voting for neoliberals
They also use panels in large scale solar projects that involve no house at all!
"He's all over the place. Increasing pollution by cars, investing in solar. You are trying to please everyone Albo. Lets see if it works."
How's he increasing pollution from cars? I thought they were trying to increase the pollution standards?
"It's how governments works. You can't make everyone happy and most importantly it's best to not piss off too many people. Also it's not increasing pollution by cars, it's just less restrictive standards than it could be. There are still restrictions."
 
"and the recycling will be done by Landfill unlimited. Terrible isn't it? We should totally switch to full coal, it had no environmental impact hey"
"I wonder which is worse, energy that literally belches dangerous waste into the air we breathe constantly, or the one that maybe can't be totally recycled after a decade or two when the generator needs replacing with an even better one. Fucking fossil fuel stooges."
