"two hours after this announcement and Australia’s Leading News Source,News Corp.hasn’t even reported the story.They may have an agenda do you think?"
There thinking how to put a negative spin on it but are struggling cause it's Australian jobs
"Exactly how Fox roll in the states - you don't just harvest misinformation/propaganda, you make sure your audience doesn't hear any news that doesn't follow the conservative narrative. In this case they've been howling for weeks about how there's no energy security in renewables because China makes all the panels. It's straight up brainwashing something needs to be done about these cunts"
"Not only is it good policy, it's politically astute. The Coaltion can't run their standard ""well who is going to pay for it!"" attacks whenever the government announces big-spending policies beause they're also desperately trying to flog nuclear which is considerably more expensive and has bigger questions to answer. It also puts the opposition in a position where their policy appears even less attractive to voters because there's another solution already happening that doesn't involve nuclear waste. The only criticism is that it took this long for the Albanese Government to make this kind of investment, although again, entering the final trimester of their term it was probably done intentionally (along with Stage 3 tax cuts) to carry some headwind into an election."
"King move by Albo politically, if Dutto and Libs talk shit on it, there against Australian manufacturing and jobs."
Can he do the same for lithium the lithium battery industry driven by subsidies for every household to install a batter. Much like the early solar rebate and assistance for installation. I don't expect to see this policy anytime soon!
Hope they snag suncable as a customer to boost their economy of scale
I kinda wish that instead of having solar panels on my roof and having to maintain them I could just buy solar panels and have them at a solar farm somewhere.
"Wow, look at how this sub is suddenly pro corporate welfare and subsidies!"
Every major manufacturing country subsidises their manufacturing sector.
"1 in 3 houses will never have solar though, because they are rentals. So really over half of available houses have solar already. In theory its a good program, but without a way to push for rentals to take up solar, solar just ends up being stimulus for the rich. Im still for it in general, but solar is starting to cap out a bit."
"Panels have a life span, they will need to be replaced, there will be a constant requirement for these products going forward. Houses aren't the only consumer of solar panels either. Commercial and utility scale usage exists and could be even more attractive to manufacturers."
"Not sure why this is being downvoted - though i wouldn't say 'never'. it's called the rental split-incentive. landlords would have to stump up a lot in upfront capital costs, but only the tenants would receive an advantage on their energy bills. It does increase the property value but it's often not enough of an incentive."
This might push me over the line tho.
Or apartments ..
Some rentals have solar
About fucking time
"Libs will now stfu about nuclear, and we get people doing more jobs for an environmentally-positive action."
