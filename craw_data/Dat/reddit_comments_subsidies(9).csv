We pay billions to subsidise Australiaís fossil fuel industry. This makes absolutely no economic sense

"If fossil fuel excise tax was instead called fossil fuel road tax, would this article change? I think all or most countries do not charge road tax to users that operate away from public roads. Farm, marine, forestry and mining are all examples. The reason I mention this is that I believe proponents of removing fossil fuel subsidies lose a lot of potential support by characterising exemption from road tax for non-public-road users as a subsidy"
"Name one country which has in place a road tax, explicitly named a road tax, in lieu of fossil fuel taxes, that also exempts vehicles which transit exclusively on private roads... Did i just describe vehicle registration fees?"
"I think all or most countries do not charge road tax to users that operate away from public roads. Farm, marine, forestry and mining are all examples They all tax fuel tho. Well most of 'em. So yeah that kind of shoots your argument dead"
"Exactly. Fuel is taxed GST like everything else, and off-road use is not exempt. But on top of GST, fuel is also taxed a per litre excise. Unlike other energy sources, fuel is taxed extra. You could just as easily say that solar panels and wind power, and EVs are being subsidised by fuel because they are never charged an excise on the killowatts of power that they use in the first place. EVs will inevitably proliferate, and that will lead to a huge shortfall in government revenue. Likewise, there'll be another huge shortfall in government revenue if coal and gas exports stop."
All this recent waffle about not going ahead with the stage 3 tax cuts is annoying. This article points the finger at the real issue. Big companies sucking money out of the government & then not paying tax. Imagine if multinationals paid their fair share of tax? How much extra money would there be for hospitals & the education system?
"A flow on effect of all the privatization BOTH parties indulged in in the past 30-40 years. There is a way to reverse it, NATIONALISATION. But that terrifies some people."
"Question, is there a precedent of multinationals paying tax we could look to elsewhere? How does it work? Clearly we can‚Äôt have say, 150 countries all taxing the same global profit margin 30% or whatever."
Is this just another calculation on the amount of diesel fuel rebate they get? If so WGAF?
"Read the article mate, a decent list of examples that aren't fuel is provided: Building the Kurri Kurri Gas-fired power station ($200 million). Concessional finance for Olive Downs coal mine ($175 million). Road construction for fracking in the Northern Territory ($173 million). Capital investment in Hunter Valley coal railway network ($161 million). $50 million to upgrade rail lines given ‚Äúinterest in developing substantial coal deposits in the Northern Galilee Basin‚Äù. $50 million for the Meandu coal mine that feeds state-owned coal-fired power stations. $72.5 million allocated to upgrading Callide and Kogan Creek coal-fired power stations. $2.8 billion committed to gas purchases for loss-making Power and Water Corporation. $720 million committed to gas transport. A $400 million ship lift partly to service the oil and gas industry. $571 million has been allocated to building or upgrading gas and coal-fired power stations, with $59.5 million to be spent in 2021-22. Another $500,000 to Chevron‚Äôs Gorgon CCS project, which has already received $60 million from the Federal Government and has never operated to approval requirements. State-owned port authorities allocated $31 million in 2021-22 and $179 million in capital works that at least partly benefit the oil and gas sector. Brown coal to hydrogen project received $13 million in state funding in 2021-22, part of $100 million committed from Victorian and Federal Governments. $66 million for the program that oversees the CarbonNet CCS project, still not operational 12 years after its establishment. $26 million for abandoned mine rehabilitation including coal mines in the Lower Hunter. The Coal Innovation Fund spent $9.9 million in 2021-22 and has a balance of $70 million. $19 million in the 2021-22 budget to upgrade an oil jetty largely used by Santos, part of a total estimated cost of * $57 million."
"The fuel tax exemption is a bit of a nothing burger IMO, because I would expect that to be maintained when the miners pivot to looking for lithium and rare-earths for batteries and other forms of renewable storage. But subsidies for new gas or coal exploration? Nah. Australia should save its money and invest it in education and research instead."
"Subsidising profitable companies doesn't make economic sense. (This includes farming btw) These companies kick back a bit of those subsidies to political decision makers, in the form of political donations. It's institutionalised corruption."
"Another way to put it: wealthy fossil fuel moguls get $22,000 of public money per minute for some reason. Seems less than ideal to pay that much to support a global extinction event"
Any subsidy offered to fossil fuel companies should be paid back in full to the Government out of their profits for that Financial Year.
"The reason, fundamentally, why subsidising energy is a good idea tm is because it benefits the economy. Trouble is, times have changed. Fossil fuels are not the future. Fossil fuels have externalised costs (aka the Anthropocene Extinction Event). The original intent of this government spending - regardless of semantics or mechanism - is still valid. Just not optimally constructed. Can you imagine what shifting this expenditure towards renewable energy would do? Energy prices will fall as we move away from fossil fuels. They are artificially low already and still struggling to compete against renewables, especially at scale. Key moment for me is that remote mining operations don't use diesel any more. Electric trucks are the norm. PV is the norm. Because it is much cheaper."
"This is one of the poorer articles I've read from The Conversation; their quality has slipped badly. As another commenter said, it calls the diesel excise rebate a subsidy. It links to a paywalled AFR article from '11; which was about FOI requests revealing Treasury had identified 17 fossil fuel subsidies the Federal Government failed to mention to the G20 as they had agreed to; but does not quote the article nor link to the revealed documents themselves. This is supposed to be academic journalism, an opinion piece in this case but that's no excuse for nebulous, goodthinkful word salad such as this: The arguments for keeping Australia‚Äôs perverse subsidies are as numerous as they are bizarre. One argument is that subsidies will help people manage rising energy costs. But direct cash payments to low income earners would be a far cheaper and more equitable solution. Subsidies lock in the status quo, while cash supports help smooth the transition away from climate-wrecking industries. Can we action a triple bottom line affirmation of our foundational governance values... I mean hallelujah, amen and enter it into the minutes."
"Calling the Fuel Tax Credit system a 'Fossil Fuel subsidy' is dishonest and poor journalism to try and trick naive readers who don't know better. The system is designed to refund tax that is used to maintain roads to businesses that operate machinery that doesn't use roads, for example farmers. There is also no viable alternative to using petrol/diesel for most of these activities, if you want food on your plate farmers need to use diesel."
"These companies don't pay the fuel exercise because they don't use public roads, at least that's the argument. Probably a stretch to call it a subsidy."
"""By far the largest of the federal subsidy is the $8 billion Fuel Tax Credit Scheme."" This is a rebate not a subsidy, Australia is not special about not expecting off road vehicles to pay fuel excise we just do it differently, countries in Europe for example put dye in their fuel and that untaxed dyed fuel is used in tractors and boats etc. Edit, I spelt dye like an idiot."
"Australia spends billions each year giving subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, despite our climate change commitments. The Australia Institute estimates that in the 2021-22 budget period, Australian federal and state governments‚Äô total fossil fuel subsidies cost A$11.6 billion. That‚Äôs up $1.3 billion on the previous year. Subsidies play an important role in economies like Australia. By pushing the prices of things down below the cost of producing them, subsidies make everything from schools and hospitals to the ABC and childcare much cheaper and more widely available than they would otherwise be. But it makes absolutely no economic sense to provide subsidies to things that a government is, or should be, trying to discourage."
The author of that article seems to think not paying tax that no one else pays is a subsidy. These sorts of articles never seem to say how much money out of general revenue the government actually gives to these companies. Is it none?

"100% It is an activist opinion piece, citing Al Gore as a reference? There is a big bit to any credibility right there."
