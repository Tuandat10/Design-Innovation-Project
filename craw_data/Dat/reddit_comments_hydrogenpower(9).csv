"I hear about hydrogen for storing excess energy being used a lot now, so why wasn't this done a lot earlier? Surely the technology was already known for a while"

comment
It's still not practical and most of the hydrogen produced is still through the steam reformation of oil and so it's really just more fossil fuel green washing
"Its been known for a while but then the world suddenly figured out how to extract oil at a far cheaper price and since then Oil has become the status quo. Solar, Wind including Hydrogen aren't new to us."
"The green hydrogen energy development and generations processes use a lot of military weaponization processes and materials, so it has historically scared and turned a lot of people off despite being relatively safe and sustainable if we just committed to it. It's one of those super rare times when the devil you know isn't actually the lesser of two evils, it just emits and broadcasts louder which...makes a lot of sense with why we use it if you really think about it."
"Known for a LONG time, but only now are fossil fuels seeing their demise. It will be a long time getting the best storage since Chevron, Exxon, Toyota and until recently GM have powerful lobbies."
"Because it made no economic sense as there are much better alternatives. It is being used more now because government threw crazy high subsidies at it, that and some states are redirecting their fund to it (alongside ccs) at the request of the fossil fuel industry"
"Hydrogen is the hail Mary answer for preserving the fossil fuel sector's hegemony on international energy trade. It's a terrible first choice for most applications otherwise, and its main value is to draw large amounts of public money so that governments and oil companies can pretend to be green, while confusing the public into delaying their first BEV purchase. It's also a way to keep selling natural gas."
You aren’t going to make steel with wind power directly.  The energy needed is perfect for hydrogen.  And hydrogen leaders are currently NOT in the carbon space.  Look at the amount of chemicals companies that have no oil upstream footprint that are leading in green hydrogen.  You are correct that carbon energy companies are going to muddle the waters with blue hydrogen push though.
You hear about it because lobby groups love it (its costly and inefficient and cannot be produced by the average person...read: it's a tax money sink they can tap into). However no one is currently actually doing mass energy storage with hydrogen.
"Nobody likes waste. Waste is inherently less efficient, yes? If the wind blows or the sun shines when the demand isn't there you just naturally want to save up that potential power for another time. But the wind will blow again, the sun will shine again tomorrow. The cost and features of any storage have to be complementary to the cycles of wind and sun and cost less than just buying more of that where that will fill the gap because wind and solar generation are cheap and storage generally isn't. Natural gas companies want to make hydrogen a thing because they want to sell their natural gas as hydrogen. So they propose a bunch of things that literally make no sense like building a national hydrogen pipeline infrastructure to deliver hydrogen to hydrogen powered devices as a temporary stopgap between the carbon past and the clean future. But there is no gap. The clean future is here. We don't need the hydrogen powered devices and certainly not a trillion dollars worth of leaky explosive hydrogen pipes running under our cities and through our bridges and tunnels. It's just stupid. But money makes people do stupid things."
Exactly. Hydrogen is a really bad option for many many reasons. Better to send electrons though wires than send explosive low density gas. One thing ppl don’t know is a car with hydrogen will naturally evaporate in days of sitting there. Engineering explained did a good video on why hydrogen is so bad.
"It's not really a technical challenge. It's just economics. Electrolysis, large-scale storage, and fuel cells are all still relatively expensive. With very high capital costs. USDOE estimates hydrogen is only cost competitive for grid storage applications greater than 100MW and 10+ hrs of storage. Storage at that scale isn't really done yet. https://www.energy.gov/eere/analysis/2022-grid-energy-storage-technology-cost-and-performance-assessment"
"That's not the purpose. There are far more effective and cheaper storage options, like water gravity storage and salt batteries. Hydrogen LEAKS. The molecules are so small that any vessel would leak. It is an effective transmission of excess power to liquid energy carriers used in airplanes and ships. As long as the people handling are professionals, it should work fine. It is unsuitable for general use, because hydrogen LEAKS, making it potentially very dangerous. People will die, if laypeople start using it daily. The main purpose, though, is green steel production and other chemical and heavy industry applications."
"OP u/Aquatic-Enigma, Hydrogen storage is extremely inefficient. In this new age of efficiency competition for basically anything, no one wants to go backwards! Hydrogen storage has a parasitic relationship to energy we have already made. For example, hydrogen NEEDS energy in order to produce hydrogen. Once that energy is made, hydrogen needs a huge amount of that energy and then less than half of it coverts into usable energy. You need specialized equipment to make hydrogen. It is expensive. You have to be trained on how to operate it. You need a large facility. You need special permits to produce it. You need special permits to store it. You special equipment to store it. It must be stored at very cold temperatures. This costs money and energy. It must be stored in specialized equipment. Over time, the actual hydrogen itself breaks down the equipment. This is called EMBRITTLEMENT. Up to this point in the process, you have lost almost 30% of all the hydrogen you have just made. Hydrogen is really small. So it escapes into our environment, even with our best-known equipment ever made. Let’s say you have a buyer… you need a special license to sell it. Expensive!! The buyer will be charged for you to deliver it to them. (This is passed on to whomever they sell it to) And whoever buys it, needs specialized equipment to keep it cold and to not let it escape. Hydrogen is single-use. It isn’t renewable. Bottom line: hydrogen is inefficient, it relies on energy already made, it is extremely costly just to make, it is expensive to transport, it is extremely expensive to keep stored, it is single-use. And what are you going to use it for?? Homeowners can buy solar panels, an inverter, and a storage battery and literally sell their excess back to the grid. Never another energy bill ever again."
Its not done today either; much less earlier! You only hear about it now because the fossil fuel industries need hydrogen's inefficiency to keep electricity and methane demand artificially high so their existing assets don't strand.
"Hydrogen storage is about 30% efficient, pumped hydroelectric is 60-80% design dependent, batteries are 80% and upward, heat batteries are 95% and upwards. Hydrogen storage is only scalable down to maybe a car, to store enough to get through winter from my excess solar generation I’d need another house worth of volume to store it. Rechargeable batteries can scale from a AAA upwards. Where hydrogen production and storage from renewables makes sense is for chemical processing plants that need hydrogen and have access to water and excess tidal or wind energy and other elements they use."
Hydrogen is exciting for the O&G industry because it allows them to pretend that they're going green. What they really want to do is preserve the centralized production and distribution networks they have spent 150 years making us dependent on
"Up till quite recently the challenge was to get a clean energy source that would be cheaper than fossil fuels, the attention went towards that. It's only as renewable energy has grown that the question of balancing and thus of storage has gained prominence. Hydrogen is the 'cheap box that's expensive to fill' of grid storage technologies. You use it to fill out the final edge case as renewable energy penetration on the grid progresses towards being concerned with the 'rare event requiring deep reserves'. The requirement to fill this edge case comes after the other options along the continuum of grid storage technologies towards 'expensive box that's cheap to fill' are used (batteries are a good example here). Ultimately most of the energy that ever gets moved in and out of storage goes in the small, expensive box. Most of the energy that's ever stored at one time is in the big cheap box. Grid storage with Green Hydrogen with today's economics seems to become a practical concern at around 70% penetration of variable Renewable energy. Most of the world just isn't there yet. Experiments in places like South Australia will help to demonstrate that yes, variable renewable energy can contra the naysayers keep the lights on economically when the 'sun isn't shining or the wind doesn't blow' & more than their local effect should help remove roadblocks of FUD to renewable rollouts elsewhere."
It's nor really beeing done at scale even now. At least if you compare it to how much batteries are deployed today.
Why store hydrogen when you're still allowed to burn natural gas?
"There rarely is excess energy to begin with. It's unlikely we'll have a lot of excess in the near future, for multiple reasons: Utility companies want to reduce excess because it's profit loss. As a national strategy, it is better to try to use energy when generated, instead of using storage. Trading excess between nations (to be used immediately) is more sensible than storage. Another reason hydrogen for energy-purposes might be rare is that it's more attractive for decarbonizing industrial processes (steel, fertilizer, etc). Hydrogen for energy only makes sense in rare cases, like off-grid locations/military bases. Even then, it will probably not be based on excess energy."
"Excess energy in Australia is a real thing today with rooftop and grid scale PV. Not likely to go away, the question is will it be stored or put to use (timed demand). Batteries storage looks to be the likely answer. I really can't see hydrogen being any more than a niche player given the round trip losses and storage issues."
"Trading excess between nations (to be used immediately) is more sensible than storage. Sometimes. Long distance HVDC projects are also expensive, so it's a cost balancing act. As/if production and storage costs drop, local storage could be more attractive. "
"Hydrogen is difficult to store. Especially in large quantities. The molecules are small enough to slip past the walls of most containers and it is light enough to disappear high into the atmosphere. The less pressure it is under the easier it is to store, this is why hydrogen balloons work but hydrogen busses have issues. Hydrogen is also flammable."
Hydrogen is actually much cheaper to store for long periods than energy in batteries.
Why do you say hydrogen buses have issues?
The OP is probably reading about the feasibility of hydrogen storage. I have not heard about it being used a lot.
"It's been used some, mostly to buffer production between SMR hydrogen plants and ammonia plants. But it's not been used for general storage of hydrogen for grid storage, since there's little point of doing that while we're still burning fossil fuels. It is likely to be very useful for the last stretch of decarbonizing the grid, the part where batteries or renewable overproduction becomes very expensive."
"We didn't need storage until intermittent energy like solar and wind began to lead new generation coming online. Solar farms are the cheapest form of electricity. Now that we need to cut carbon emissions, they will be predominant, and to fill gaps we need storage."
"Storage is one answer, and batteries are coming to be ideal for that. But in the transition period if you need to run generators you already bought to fill schedule gaps that might see us through. Nobody wants to build a new one for a few hours a week though. That's never going to pay off."
"I don't think this is really being done to any great extent today. There's a lot of hype about someday doing it, but it's all predicated on there being lots of excess renewable electricity being made at times and in places where it can't just be put in the grid. I don't think that is very common, and where it is, hydrogen has to compete with batteries which are more efficient and getting cheaper all the time."
"To answer ops question, there hasn't been much ""excess"" energy available on the grid untill recently. Mid 2010s is the first time I remember seeing it in the news where places like Cali or Australia had too much pv available over the course of a day. Basically the whole grid system and energy distribution is going through a reimagination right now. Instead of burning fossil fuels or running a dam or nuclear turbine at rates humans regulate, we now are capturing solar and wind power at rates and times we can't regulate, so the new question is what do we do with that excess now. ""Excess"" hydro power was indeed used for hydrogen and ammonia production from the 1920s to about the 70s. It got replaced by smr when methane became more widely available. Examples are Rjukan in Norway and the Aswan damn. https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4079/3/2/11"
"Hydrogen is a decent option as a form of long term energy storage for backup power production, and it has many uses in industry for processing energy or as a chemical ingredient. However, excess energy on the grid is unlikely to be the optimal source of power to produce hydrogen since production infrastructure will need a very predictable and cheap input source of power, and competing with batteries to procure a portion of the daily grid surplus is unlikely to be reliable and would probably lead to the infrastructure often being left idle. Thus, I think Hydrogen production will need to be paired with dedicated clean power facilities, allowing very predictable energy levels for appropriate size scaling of facilities."
"Hydrogen is a decent option as a form of long term energy storage for backup power production oh, what makes you think that? Because everything I know abut hydrogen make me think it a fucking terrible option for any kind of energy storage."
"Here is a lil short about Hydrogen from Nate Hagen's podcast, The Great Simplification..  Check out the whole podcast episode for an interesting discussion on Hydrogen."
The Ira gave tax credits for making green hydrogen.
"Green hydrogen is considered “green” even if it is a BLEND. What constitutes a blend? Everything. You can make 99.99999999% dirty hydrogen and mix it with 1 vapor of “green” hydrogen and you have a qualified green hydrogen blend. This was passed by paying a lot of expensive oil and gas lobbyists to convince Joe Manchin to define it this exact way. But but but… why is that important? Because effectively, oil and gas can ramp up dirty hydrogen production and it still qualifies them for billions of subsidies. Yes, your actual tax dollars are going to contribute to dirty hydrogen production that actively kills the planet. Look it up yourself."
"Because hydrogen was expensive, however it cost is going down as China is starting to mass produce it. In China, it is cost on par with diesel and after natural gas price. I mean carbon tax is adding cost to fossil fuel, hydrogen push will be further. It is good news for rails, heavy trucks and power station. My country is building one hydrogen power station."
"Hydrogen is EXTREMELY corrosive. It's literally acid. pH is chemist short hand for potential for hydrogen. Containers strong enough to safely hold pressurized hydrogen are metal. But, that gets corroded in no time. We still don't have a cost effective solution."
"Hydrogen in its molecular form is not ionized. pH is all about H+-ions, which H2 doesn't form. H2 is not acidic, is not corrosive. H2 is a bitch to store, that much is true, but that's mostly because it leaks from even the tiniest gaps, even completely leaking through some solid materials. You also want to use either extremely cold temperatures or very high pressures to achieve reasonable storage densities. Then there's what you probaly misinterpreted as corrosion: Hydrogen embrittlement. When diffusing through some materials, hydrogen will embed in their structure, making them more brittle. This doesn't affect all materials, only some metals, like steel and titanium. Stainless steel, copper and aluminium are much less affected by this. Composite materials, afaik, are not at all affected by this. The real answer is, we figured storage out a while ago, plus you don't even need to store it, as chemical industry will take the stuff off your hands anyway. What's changing is we're for the first time now seeing an actual economical use case for grid-scale storage, as many countries are reaching the point of 100% renewables at least temporarily. This means there's now free (or basically free) energy available sometimes, which means now is the first time you really want to even have storage capacity available. Previously it would've just sat around collecting dust."
