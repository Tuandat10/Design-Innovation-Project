Home owners push for battery subsidy as solar power benefits become 'increasingly marginal'

comment
"Benefits of solar are mostly in reduced consumption, not in buybacks."
Yep reading the article there are ways he can advantage of his solar during the day. Run as much as possible during the day. Delay washer. Run hot water system if you or electric hot water. Delay dishwasher. If you have a pool delay the pump till the day time. Have your a/c on timer so it turns on while the sun is still out before you get home so the house is at the desired temperature when you walk in instead of walking in and turning it on and smashing your power consumption as your ac is fighting to get house at the desired temperature. All of these things will save you money on your power bill and you will payback your solar system faster I feel like he has installed it thinking he will get zero power bill which won’t happen.
"It’s been this way for like ten years. The FiT doesn’t do anything for anyone. Use your power, don’t sell it."
We need to make it an incentive for landlords as well. I'd guess most renters don't have solar and are paying for electricity themselves and have no agency to have solar installed.
Exactly this - upper middle class is paying nothing for electricity and the cost of maintaining the electricity grid we all depend on is shifted to people who rent or who otherwise can't afford solar. It's just more upper middle class welfare.
"The article focusses a little heavily on the personal grievance of one user so that he comes across as a bit selfish, or entitled. That's a shame... there's a possible solution staring everyone in the face here if the government are prepared to step in and get proactive. If they were to fund, whether in full or as a partial share, the use of household batteries in a linked grid set up using smart tech to manage the load and distribution you could end up with a series of micro grids across the suburbs with neighbourhoods generating and distributing their own power."
"Electrical Engineer working in this space. The problem with linked household batteries is that they introduce far more inefficiencies, complications and are just generally worse in all aspects compared to a localised community battery with damn few comparable benefits, hence why much of the movement is going in that direction. "
They are rolling out community batteries for this purpose around Victoria and parts of NSW already. https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/grants/neighbourhood-batteries https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/big-batteries-to-shore-up-power-in-20-victorian-tourist-towns-20240312-p5fbv4.html
I work in retail energy. People export minimal solar and still only have a hard on for a high feed in tariff. It's basic maths and I still don't understand how people with the money to pay for a solar installation can work out that the benefits are in what you use from you solar instead of from the grid. Having zero savings off the reference rate and a 20cFIT means nothing if you only export 110 kwh in a bill cycle.
I have a theory for this. Few years back there were a ton of jobs for selling solar panels.  People were sold lies by inexperienced or unscrupulous salespeople that just saw commissions. They convinced people that weren't interested in researching the best applications and as a result have unrealistic expectations about how their investment will pay off and accordingly did not adjust usage habits to optimise the time needed to see returns 
"Phenomenal. Guy gets subsidised solar panels, complains about not getting enough value, asks for more subsidies. What a prick."
"Like I said upthread, if the mining companies were paying royalties on the same scale as they do in Norway, there'd be plenty of money to subsidise batteries for everyone. If you object to your taxes being used for subsidies, then I suggest you look at just how much little the mining companies are paying, compared to places like Norway."
More subsidies for homeowners
A small subsidy would get the ball rolling and help the grid during peak hours. Seems like a better long term option than temporary cash handouts for your energy bill.
"Many years ago, early 1990s, there were subsidies for grid-connected solar panels, inverters, etc. There was also a separate fund for subsidies for off-grid systems - panels, inverters, and batteries. Those subsidies ranged from 30% to 50% of the price of the system. The funds came from royalties during the mining resources boom. You'd usually pay the balance to the installer and they'd bill the program for the rest. Now, you don't get a subsidy, you get Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), that you can sell to big polluters to get some of your money back, but it's not a lot, less than 20%. If the govt would review royalties on our mineral resources - including gas - there'd be plenty of money available to subsidise home batteries. And if those batteries were configured properly as per the article, there'd be a lot less worry about overloading the grid, and a lot less bill stress for consumers."
"Suburb scale community batteries. Preferably sodium or sand. With every house in the suburb feeding into it, it would be achievable in every suburb in Aus."
"All of these household subsides should be scrapped, with the money going into grid-scale renewables projects instead. We would get better economics of scale, and the money wouldn't be going to the wealthiest households as it is now."

"IMO getting as many people onto batteries as possible has massive advantages and run on effects. Helps with grid stability, encourages the purchase of EVs and helps the country with its emission KPIs"
It’ll be better to have grid scale and neighbourhood batteries than household batteries. That money spent then benefits everyone instead of the few haves.
"There are enormous benefits of siting batteries on the demand side of the grid. Wind and solar generation are rapidly getting cheaper, but they are causing grid costs to rise faster. Overall, electricity is getting a bit more expensive. If we don't change how grids are run, this will continue. The government should setup a battery virtual power plant distributed in the homes of people with solar. Similar to this company: https://www.volts.wtf/p/a-clever-new-way-to-distribute-storage The homeowners pay $2000 to install a 20-30 kWh battery. The virtual powerplant (acting as the electricity retailer) can store, then sell electricity when wholesale prices are high. The homeowner gets lower grid import costs (for the little they still need to import). The virtual power plant makes enough to pay back borrowing costs over 15 years. And everyone else benefits from lower electricity prices - less new generation and powerlines are needed to be built, less grid upgrade costs. We have so much rooftop generation being wasted now. With LFP and sodium ion battery prices about to massively reduce in price for at least a decade, this scheme is a no brainer. It should be government owned to take advantage of their low borrowing costs."
"It's not wrong though. They charge through the teeth for peak usage, when you cannot avoid power usage (dinner, showers, lights, heat etc). People complain about how much excess solar is pumped into the grid during the day, but that wouldn't happen if it was going to a battery. And in the news they're saying we will have a shortage of electricity, hence the need for gas... In Vic there's an 8k interest free loan to help with the initial purchase of a battery... but your automatically signed up to the VPP, so they can take power from your battery whenever they want. This means that the consumer, whilst still paying for electricity service, and paying off the battery and solar, is paying for the infrastructure with no compensation for their outlay, and rising bill prices despite them taking pressure off the grid, and providing power to the grid when required."
"The mistake most people make is getting too small a system. The standard is a little 6kw system which generally wont give a typical house of 4 much benefit in export, and will only benefit day time usage (not ideal if everyone's at work/school all day). There is a relatively small increase in cost to go to a 10kW+ system which will produce meaningful export, and there are decent FIT deals (8-12c uncapped) out there if you hunt around for them. I literally haven't seen an electricity bill since I put solar on, including running ducted aircon for months, charging a car, etc. In my case, adding nearly 60% to the size of the system cost an extra 35%, and dramatically improved the payback/ROI of the system. I think most people just go for the cheap option without thinking of the benefits."
"Not sure about other states, but in WA there were limits on the size of solar if connected to the grid for exporting. There are ways to get a bigger system, but it meant that the average person would go for the default, grid connected option to receive the FIT."
The mistake most people make is getting too small a system. The standard is a little 6kw system which generally wont give a typical house of 4 much benefit in export The state won't let me put much more than this on the roof mate.
And renters in apartments are fucked even more. We can't even get evs because charging is expensive using public chargers
"""Entitled pricks want handout"" fixed it. The nerve in the middle of a cost of living crisis to think your batter should be the priority. What about increasing the food and rent subsidy? I.e the dole. (I work full time)"
"It is disappointing now, when it started 60c was pretty good. I agree its marginal at best now."
Non-home owners push for home subsidy as renting benefits become 'increasingly marginal'.
An ev with vehicle to grid is another option. Vehicle batteries are much bigger than household batteries plus you get a bonus car thrown in. 
"Depending on when you shower and if your hot water is electric you can essentially treat it as a battery. Turn it off in the evening, should stay hot enough for a couple of showers even in the morning, then flick it on in the morning before you head out and the solar heats it up all day"
"No. I don't want public funds providing middle class welfare to people who can afford batteries but want the government to give them a discount. Instead, I want those funds going into investment in publically-owned grid scale batteries and pumped Hydro so we all benefit."
"Sitting at my work desk, I have a UPS sitting next to my computer. What if instead of one large individual battery they design smaller batteries that work just for individual circuits. Say one smaller batter for the hot water system circuit, one for the fridge circuit and one for the stove circuit. I'm sure they are the most power hungry in any household. If you have kids that suck up power like there is no tomorrow, putting in a small battery that charges during the day, that they use overnight to charge/power all their gadgets would help over a year."
"Remember the difference between power and energy, Power is the rate at which you use energy. A battery and it's inverter needs to be very powerful to drive a stove. I can imagine a stove or oven asking for 3kw or easily 5kw. A fridge has lower power requirements. 0.7kw would be a big fridge. The battery and inverter covering the stove would shrug that off so it would be wasteful to buy a separate system."
My dodo's FiT is 3.3 cents per kw now. What a joke. I signed up not long after two weeks and they changed the rate to 3.3 cents.
"Get subsidies to get solar, save fuckloads on electricity bills, then complain and want more handouts because the advantages of solar are smaller than before. It’s classic Australian middle class hand out mentality"
