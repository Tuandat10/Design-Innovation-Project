Can we actually go 100% renewable energy?
"I actually support renewable energy and even some form of a carbon price to reduce emissions. However Iím unsold that we can go 100% renewable. Im saying this because when Iíve asked for examples of countries that have I get given Norway and Costa Rica which are so geographically different and more smaller. I know solar and wind are cheaper but my concern is how it will work in off-peak hours. Is our batteries up to scratch to store it for long periods of time at scale as a substitute for coal and gas plants? It would have given me comfort it at least a major country like Korea, France, Germany etc had gone 100% renewable.

I also remember here in NSW poles and wires (transmission lines) are a massive part of our bill and afaik we need to build out a lot more to transition. If it is a lot more expensive id at least like to know. Id be happy to pay a carbon price to make it happen and am sure the long term benefits could outweigh the short term costs but think transparency is needed to build public support and certainty. Im just worried we have no readymade replacements for our retiring coal plants either in the form of renewable or fossil fuel."

"As an engineer working in power generation, transmission and distribution, the short answer is it's possible in the future but improbable with today's technologies. You need a grid with high inertia and sufficient spinning reserve, and transmission infrastructure that is highly automated and faults can be located at pinpoint accuracy, just to name a couple of things needed for safe, reliable and economical electric power."
"People tend to forget that you can't just build the grid capacity on renewables and call it good! I'm a mechanical engineer and worked with someone like yourself who has moved back into grid operations and he used to get so fucked off with people arguing for 100% renewables. The big one was what you've mentioned, synchronous vs asynchronous power generation and power reserves of some sort for when a large chunk of generating capacity has been reduced i.e a massive weather incident where there's no wind or sun!"
And the only stable source with 0 emissions is nuclear. So I don‚Äôt get why people are flipping their lids and losing their minds about things like construction time‚Ä¶
What kind of impact does so many private solar systems have on the grid?
"Lol. ""Transmission lines are the biggest cost"". No. Governments giving away our resources for free, not securing a baseline for Australians and not taxing energy companies is why we pay so much. These things should be countering the costs of infrastructure ."
Queensland has the highest coal royalty tax in the world..... that's the only thing keeping us afloat.
"IMO 100% very unlikely with current technology. The first stage of transition is relatively cheap. Solar & wind. The later stages with addition of adequate energy storage, maybe geothermal or wave/tidal generation will get progressively more expensive. I don‚Äôt know at what point (say 90%?), but the costs would get very, very high. Having electric supply that is guaranteed under all conditions would mean over engineering at great expense. A week of poor weather for wind & solar, multi year drought that reduces hydro storage etc. I don‚Äôt see how it would be possible to go 100% renewables without having extremely expensive battery storage on standby for these infrequent but highly likely to occur events. Think about it on a micro scale. House with solar & battery. Ok for 90% of the time. Cost say $20k without subsidies. Remove the grid and you have to add x number (say 2 additional) of batteries. One of which you only use once a week. The other once a year. Cost of system is now double the original to be self sufficient for that last 10%."
98% is easy. But I consider that job done. More important priorities to chase than chasing that last 2% of burning stuff.
"The one thing you can count on no matter what, is the price will always go up"
"No because batteries have to play a part for any fully renewable plan to work, when the maths are done for how big that battery storage needs to be, even just for households the amount needed is too large with current technology and households are a drop in the ocean compared to what else is needed"
"Yes. I work in finance and have been in energy and renewables for 20 odd years. 100% renewables grids will provide enough generation to well over compensate for capacity factor, have chemical and hydro based energy storage and in the Australian context will use hydrogen forming capacity. There are enough potential and viable pumped hydro sites along the NEM/East coast alone to provide capacity for ~5+ times our national energy demand. We will be a net energy exporter."
"Sorry, but this is complete fantasy. I‚Äôve also worked in this industry for 20+ years and not in finance, as a sparky and now an energy technical support sme. We delivery grid scale integrated energy solutions including BESS. Do the numbers for renewables work? Yes. In so far as we can theoretically produce the current power we are using. However, to do it we need to take what is a centralised one way grid design and turn it into a decentralised network with shit everywhere. We‚Äôve started doing this and it is a total clusterfuck already. There‚Äôs a reason the power engineers of the last century went with centralised power supply and didn‚Äôt instead build suburban generators, which would have made transmission far easier. The reason is simple. You need 100,000 electricians and mechanics instead of 50 who work at the large plant. On top of that, you need the best ones because power generation is just a tad more complicated than a Hyundai Tucson or installing a double GPO. Guess what we have fuck all of in Australia? Electricians and mechanics. We don‚Äôt need finance, or IT, or HR, or even engineers. We need technicians with practical skills to maintain this shit show of a grid. Next we need storage, and so much of it you can‚Äôt even fathom. Because solar and wind are unreliable. They do not produce power when we want it, they produce it when the weather suits. We can not accept unreliable power. Even hydro, the most reliable of green energy, relies on the weather and in a world where we can no longer rely on what the weather will do, is going 100% renewable smart? We have two viable storage options, BESS and water. For water, see the previous point. It has to be fresh and we need a shit load of it. If we had a shit load of viable pumped water sites in Australia we‚Äôd have the hydro plants already. This point is just complete horseshit. BESS isn‚Äôt the solution, I work on these things everyday. They need to be air conditioned, they‚Äôre incredibly dangerous and so they shut down to protect themselves regularly. Then you need to send a tech. Go back to the previous point about decentralised power and the maintenance needed. We are sending sparkies all over the country already to keep these things going. I can promise you we‚Äôve produced more CO2 maintaining BESS than they will ever save us. A 40‚Äô container can store about 8MW/h. It‚Äôs drained in about 30min. Even if we have 500MW/h stored,the amount you‚Äôd need to run a medium town like Cairns for the night, what do we do when its overcast the next day and we can‚Äôt charge our batteries? This isn‚Äôt a numbers decision, it‚Äôs a practical decision and the CSIRO never came to us to ask our opinion or costs I can tell you. No one in the industry is seriously considering 100% renewables because it would produce an unreliable shit storm where every house ends up running a little generator to cover the hours/days/weeks where the mains power is down. If you go 100% renewables you will get renewables and gas/coal. If we don‚Äôt start building some nuclear plants now, you can forget 2050 targets. While Dutton is a flog he‚Äôs bang on with this one. You simply can not tolerate an unreliable grid and to get reliability you need base load steam plants. So just choose your heat source, oil, coal, gas, or nuclear? If you care about the environment there‚Äôs only one choice."
"That‚Äôs the problem, you work in finance and not engineering."
"Look Up, this bright fusion reactor will outlast humanity !"
"Yep - and everything else is just a second hand effect of it. Wind is from heating of the sun. Tides are an effect of a spinning earth around a spinning sun, so it's angular momentum imparted from that orbit. Gas and fossil fuels are the sum totally of millions of years of sun's energy and geologic forces smooshing together plants and animals and baking them into an enegry rock/paste. We're going to have to get to a point where we can use that energy without a millennia long production process."
"Yes, easily. Talk to any of the countries going 100% and everyone one of them will say Australia has it the best and easiest to go 100% renewable. Battery tech will take 20 years to truly phase everything else out. Maybe less if we are lucky. But it'll come in the form of iron-sodium based batteries (probably, maybe something different) which are so insanely cheap and also not nearly as hard on the environment as lithium based products. Which is why, we need to spend 20 years phasing into mass solar, wind and hydro projects to be over-sized, and set up in a way to guarantee full batteries on the worst days to cover all down time. How do we know it's possible? I guarantee it is. But how can I say that? I have installed 2 batteries and 15kw of solar on my house. Year round I use more power than before installing the system. I averaged around $500 per bill for the household before. However now I am in growing credit to the utility despite paying connection fees. The system has cost under $30k, that means pay-back period is under 10 years.... However the life expectancy is more like 20. So if renewable is twice as cost effective for me to buy than use the utilities, then it's only MORE cost effective for them to do it. On top of that, this tech only gets cheaper. These $10k batteries were $20k a year ago. Imagine when they are $1k."
I understand how its cost effective at an individual level but could we rely on batteries at grid scale. If an individual household costs $30k and yes of course its getting cheaper I can only imagine how expensive it would be to cover roofs in an entire state. As well as the transmission infra to go with it. My only knowledge of batteries is based on Tesla‚Äôs battery in South Australia which had little output compared to costs. But that was in 2017/18 I believe and know the situation could have changed dramatically since then.
There's a huge difference between having a single house run at net zero and having a whole county run with zero non renewables
You are dreaming‚Ä¶ unless you think the nation has to deindustrialise‚Ä¶It‚Äôs not possible or proven in a modern economy
"Probably 95% Duklnkelflaute periods (no wind or sun) are the remaining say 5% In the long run, energy stores will cover those (not necessarily batteries but including batteries) but that's still a way off. Decades not centuries."
 
What happens when we‚Äôre in a drought and the water is at low levels?
"Yes, the countries that are able to get close to or be 100% renewable easily have advantages, an abundance of geothermal (Iceland) or Hydroelectric (Norway). South Australia for instance will soon be able to claim to be 'net 100% renewable' which will involve selling power to other sates when there is an excess but importing power from western states when needed. The claim is basically 'we produce more than 100% of our power usage even though some of our used power comes from non renewable sources'. I think thats a bit of a cop out as far as 100% goes because it only works when other states play ball as far as filling in power when needed. Tasmania for isntance has a goal of 200% renewables but this still doesn't mean all the power used in Tasmania will be from renewable sources. So X% renewable is a bit of a lie but net zero emissions is a possibility that we should probably be moving towards rather than 100% renewable. Especially since as always the devil is in the details 100% renewable could be twice the price of 95% renewable for instance. Finally whilst I may end up looking like a moron and eating my words but I think the storage technology will come. We can convert excess electrity to hydrogen for instance (and even synthetic hydrocarbons) neither of which is particularly efficient - about 40% round trip for hydrgoen. However considering the size of Australia we have the ability to have a significant amount of 'spare' electricity and the energy loss compared to batteries may not be that terrible. Honestly for the first time in history we are looking at having excess electricity and need to find something to do with it, and all of the things that are energy inefficiant may prove to be viable with absurdly cheap renewable energy. The US navy is working on converting nuclear power to jet fuel (useful for carrier groups), a UK company called ZERO is building a demonstration plant to make fuel using water and atmospheric CO2. So yeah, the future is looking bright for renewables even if the immediate path for Australia is simply 80-90% renewable it lays the groundwork for a possible future of 100% renewable and even exporting power. I'm aware of pilot projects to generate hydrogen with electrolysis, bond it with nitrogen to form ammonia which is more energy dense than hydrogen and already shipped around the world in decent quantities. It can then be stripped of it's hydrogen to be used as energy at the destination."
"South Australia for instance will soon be able to claim to be 'net 100% renewable' Despite the claims renewables are far cheaper, the states with the most renewables (TAS, SA, ACT) have amongst the highest electricity bills. They often blame gas/coal still being in use setting the highest cost provider which dictates electricity prices to the consumer. However, some argue why other states that use gas/coal but have less renewables aren't as affected. I think SA will be the benchmark once they go 100% renewables. If electricity prices don't drop sharply for the consumer then it's going to create a lot of negative press for the benefits of renewables and ammunition for the Coalition. Especially for their push towards nuclear power."
"SA is still heavily reliant on gas; over the last 3 mths it provided 45% of its power. Source. Not to mention the security of importing Victorian coal-fired power when they need it. I want us to be as damn close to 100% renewables as anyone, but I don‚Äôt believe for a heartbeat that we don‚Äôt need a controlled power capability for when the uncontrolled power (sun, wind, hydro) has an off day or week."
"The US navy is working on converting nuclear power to jet fuel (useful for carrier groups Can you post a link on this? I think you have misunderstood, the UK navy is instead making renewables from the nuclear reactor‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt believe any navy would consider swapping their nuclear reactor ships for a jet turbine engine"
norway exports the most profits from LPG.
No.
Short answer; no
"France 70% Nuclear, 3.8% coal. Germany 60% renewables, 25% coal, relies on other countries for electrical generation on overcast/low wind days. Its a struggle Many people say battery tech will improve in the future, but currently, it's betting on something we don't have, anywhere, at all. It is not possible to run 100% renewables right now due to the intermittent nature of it as well as the difficulty in storing energy. It doesn't like to be stored Nuclear is a proven, reliable source of energy, and I don't understand how it has become so political, people are commenting that its some far-right policy, it's getting insane."
"Dutton's nuclear plan would be capable of providing only 16% of our electricity needs by 2050. The remaining 84% would still need to be provided by renewables to reach net zero as they've promised (for now). It's being pitched as nuclear vs renewables, but in reality both are still a majority renewables grid."
"We have solutions for storing energy; some are more mature than others. Hydroelectric storage is great if you have the geography for it. Redox flow batteries would comprise the other large scale alternative that's still very efficient. Nuclear in Australia is a far-right policy because it has been adopted by the far-right ‚Äî and it certainly appears that the reason they have adopted it so is to disrupt a renewable energy transition. Fission power is fantastic, but in Australia at least, it is has been verified multiple times to be by far the most expensive alternative to fossil fuels. It would have been a different story had we adopted it last century and built up the industry and expertise."
I can't believe how many people are falling for Duttons lies.
"Nuclear is a proven Proven to have a long history of high risk construction and absolutely massive cost blowouts. Flamanville 3? Olkiluoto 3? But maaaate, Australia will be different! Sure. If you‚Äôre a Northern European country or a dense Asian country trying to reduce your emissions then nuclear is indeed a fine way to do that. But if you‚Äôre a large country like Australia with plenty of renewable resources then nuclear is just throwing money away."
A working fusion reactor would be the ultimate solution. Why is there not a global campaign to encourage people to study Nuclear Physics in order to solve this problem? The benefits of a successful technology far outweigh that of any form of political activism.
We have one. In the sky. Nice safe distance away.
"A working fusion reactor. You mean, like, the sun?"
Is Tasmania 100% renewable?
No.
      
"In the short term, no. But the biggest issue around the debate is ""Perfect being the enemy of good."" The naysayers seem to believe that if any proposed measure is not 100% effective on day one, it's a failure. EVs don't have enough charging locations EVs don't have the range. The sun doesn't shine 100% of the time. The wind doesn't blow all of the time. Wind turbines kill birds. Climate change scares the kiddies If we applied the same criteria of efficiency and practacality to motor vehicles at the beginning we would still be dependent on horses. But it's all incremental and just like petrol cars, planes, mobile phones, computers etc and every other large and complex thing we have done it will get better, cheaper and more efficient over time. Not having done anything is not a valid excuse for never doing anything."
"Every percentage point beyond 50% is exponentially more expensive. We could get to 70 or even 80% relatively painlessly. 80% to 100% is a massive problem though. The only countries that have been able to do it are interconnected to countries that haven‚Äôt, or have massive hydro reserves, neither of which is an option for us."
No chance.
"Yes but the expense is convex in the emissions reduction, as gas peaking plants are a far cheaper way to cover shortfalls in renewable output than storage given extant technology, though costs are falling rapidly so that might not be the case in the near future. Getting to 90 % renewable would be far cheaper as you now can cut the required storage considerably by using open cycle gas plants very rarely, just to cover the rare events with atypically low wind over weeks. This also could be done with biomass but it's questionable if this is desirable. Possibly cheaper than storage is to just build significant overcapacity, this depends on the relative price of generation vs storage, or to use long distance transmission to smooth over large regions, which depends on the costs of transmission vs generation. Also if electricity to fuel plants are economical, it become optimal to build a large amount of capacity and match demand and supply by running the electricity to fuel plants only in periods of excess supply, i.e. now you would have a huge capacity for load shedding."
   
"Without base load power you cannot. Base load power is coal, nuclear and hydro. Gas maybe but too expensive. All the idiot politicians telling everyone that renewables are the solution they are 100% wrong. I‚Äôm an engineer and spent 30+ years in power generation, transmission and distribution so, I know a couple of things."
No
"If all manufacturing ceased and we are willing to eat shit and move into pods, then yes. One small example is freshly baked bread. This is baked early in the morning before sunrise. If they baked it in the middle of the day the consumer won't see it until late afternoon, so on present shopping patterns most people would be eating stale bread. Milk is another example. Renewables can do more but to go to 100% on available tech is going to result in an unstable electricity grid in which bigger users will either have to close or invest in back up generation. It will be like Lagos in which many thousands of cheap Chinese generators will fire up during a blackout and cause air pollution never before seen in this country."
 
"Multiply that 2-3c by the capacity factor difference between renewables (~30%) to normalise against the capacity factor of nuclear (~90%). Then, normalise the cost of the life of the asset with that of nuclear also. For step 1 - 2-3c becomes 6-9c. For step 2 - 6-9c becomes 15-22c All of a sudden things look very different."
it is possible. We need to have overcapacity say solar and wind farms that can supply 200% of demand. this way even with variable wind nature they will satisfy demand. And batteries and pumped hydros to balance. I think in the close perspective we need gas powered stations to fill gaps. They're much cleaner than coal and can be turned on and off quickly. Once battery tech gets better these will be just backups.
"Yes we can, but the decades of indecision leading up to this current government (doing a rapid game of catch up) means it will be very painful and somewhat chaotic. Decentralising the grid will be the hardest part. I support nuclear but not on Dutton‚Äôs either/or terms. His is a pitch to allow his fossil fuel mates decades more plunder and burn (not to the benefit of the average Australian). We cannot plug the gap with more fossil fuels because the climate is literally on a knife‚Äôs edge. If you want a reasonable voice to listen to on this, l‚Äôd recommend tuning into what these guys say: https://emergencyleadersforclimateaction.org.au/who-we-are/ I say this noting that Australians seem to like to listen to the voices of influential people who hail from everyday backgrounds. These guys aren‚Äôt playing with politics, they are literally dealing with the firestorms created from it."
"Tasmania is one of the few regions globally to have achieved 100% renewable energy generation in November 2020, primarily due to the high contribution of hydropower. Not a country but it‚Äôs big as one in Europe. Population is tiny though. I support decentralisation of power because you don‚Äôt want to beholden to a corporate charging you whatever they want because they have control over something essential for life. The more people go off grid the better in my opinion and less power for the Aussie magnates/oligarchs have over your life hence the resistance by so many for change. It‚Äôs about power over your life and cashing in on someone‚Äôs lifespan, guaranteed profit. I‚Äôm not against the idea of nuclear but Europe has it because they have no land mass. Their regions are tiny and not flat land empty like Australia. But with nuclear you retreat to centralised power and centralised government and giving political power to the few who control its inputs and outputs like the company or country you need to rely on to enrich your uranium and then import it back to Australia, you become beholden to them and ideologically I‚Äôm resistant to. You also need to change the nuclear proliferation treaty and the contract the libs signed with America about Aukus where it states that Australia will not have a civil nuclear industry. Not sure how that will work if nuclear ever gets built which I suspect it‚Äôs just a delay tactic rather than any real plan the libs would follow through. That‚Äôs how I see it anyway, I‚Äôm no expert."
"If there's one thing I've learned in the past few weeks is that Reddit is completely unable to have balanced fair discussions on this anymore. Facts no longer matter. Ideologies appear to dominate. There appears to be two ideological road blocks that dominate: A climate fever where green is the only acceptable answer, no negatively is tolerated. Facts like going fully green is going to cost huge money, resulting in higher power prices and/or significant tax money aren't tolerated well. Neither is any discussion about the elephant in the room that is the futility of all this given the direction of the wider world where counties like China and India continue to build coal and increase emissions with no end in sight. Finally anyone who isn't fully green is a climate denier, almost as bad as a nazi. Politics, where things are only good if your team proposes them. Nuclear from my memory was quite popular here on Reddit until Dutton proposed actually doing it. To answer your question OP. We can go fully renewable, but are we all actually willing to pay the price? And do we know what that price will be?"
"Solar PV and wind are quick, simple and cheap. Grids of many scales have already been built with them. This is a good thing because the federal government sometime struggles to build a car park. Here is one version of what a 98% intermittent renewable current hydro grid can look like in Australia: https://reneweconomy.com.au/a-near-100pct-renewable-grid-for-australia-is-feasible-and-affordable-with-just-a-few-hours-of-storage/"
Can‚Äôt wait to pay the sun tax


"Not yet, but the technology will only improve. Need better batteries to store the energy generated that does not leave a large footprint when it life expires. It is the way forward."

"If the sun, wind and tide were a permanent 24 hour fixture you could. Everyone knows this is not the case, therefore it is like most ""crisis"" a power grab."
"This may be a stupid question but couldn‚Äôt WA provide much of the east coast‚Äôs peak energy demand through solar and wind? Sure there‚Äôs some significant infrastructure to get it over here but it feels like whilst our geographic spread makes some things a challenge, in this case it is truly to our benefit by giving us an extra 2-3 hours of sunlight a day and being its own climate completely unrelated to the East coast‚Äôs."
Yes. Anyone who has ever been opposed to renewables always seems to highlight technological flaws or faults with grids etc etc. but they all seem to forget that technology advances. Battery storage for domestic use will be a thing one day. When a particular industry is subject to technological ongoing technology advancements the question isn‚Äôt IF it‚Äôs WHEN.
I think in the same way how we grew to be relying upon coal and gas fire power stations we will eventually rely upon renewables will it happen in a short term no if you read some of the replies above the issue is with the engineering not necessarily the technology it's about the potential cost of rolling out things right now if you look at the cost of solar panels they've decreased by what 80 or 90% and it's still going down I think it's a good thing that we're looking revising renewing how we generate electricity we've spent nearly 100 years being a slave to coal gas oil and they have clouded our ability to innovate
"Would a world grid solve a lot of the issues here, just theoretical."
"Not with the current conventional renewable eg. Waves/hydro, solar and wind. First there is no scalability in the immediate short-term for a extremely hot day for example. You can't make a solar panel make more energy just because you need it, nor can you make it produce energy if the conditions aren't ideal like at night or low wind. We dont have storage technology to store energy times they can produce to times they can't. At least not at scale yet. The need remains for a stable baseline level of power that can be scaled up on short notice by demand. Renewable simply don't have that ability, right ow if we went 100% Renewable we wouldn't have power at night, non windy days or days of calm seas. I'm sure the technology comes along eventually, but I bel that nuclear is the answer of that stopgap and solution to the problems that Renewables inherently have."
"It's not just storage that's the issue... Everyone talks about electricity generation... But for true decarbonisation you need to talk about energy generation.... Energy include fossil fuel heat for various industries, it includes fuel for cars and transport. If you really are tackling climate change.. It has to tackle all these, not just the electricity side. Energy production rose 1% in 2021-22, to 19,111 PJ In 2021-22 total electricity generation in Australia increased 2% to 272 TWh (978 PJ) That's alot of energy needed... I don't think there's enough solar cell production to hit this target anytime soon..."
No ‚ÄúRenewables‚Äù is leftists co-opting the meaning of words for their agenda. Just like ‚Äúpride‚Äù. No one cares about your sexual orientation and it‚Äôs not an achievement or earnt ‚ÄúRenewables‚Äù generate incredible amounts of waste in both their creation and disposal
You support a carbon tax to reduce emissions? Because we don't already pay too much for our power huh we need another extra tax on top of that. I like your idea!
"Norway has 6% renewable, one of the lowest users of renewables on earth. The govt chose to define hydro as ‚Äúnot renewable‚Äù for the purpose of the carbon tax / subsidy system so that‚Äôs the rules. There is no way we can get anywhere near net zero. Even the public service, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holmes a Court and Turnbull investment businesses, advised the anything below -84E was impossible on known technologies. And that‚Äôs not known commercialised tech - it included absurd ideas like gReEn HyDrOgEn that can never work, and other wildly unprofitable alt fuels. This is 16% from technologies that haven‚Äôt even been invented yet."
"No dude, there‚Äôs just not enough sun or wind in this country that‚Äôs 99% not populated to go around."
"Yes, but no. We need massive battery storage facilities, which are great but have a limited lifespan. Each house should have their own battery storage as well."
We can ride horse to work save a-lot of energy
 
Carbon price? Good grief. Shocking people can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening.
if nuclear is one then yes. Without I don't think you can call solar and wind renewable when the equipment is made offshore with coal and transported with oil
"I‚Äôve never seen anyone credible with a STEM background argue for that. People like BA‚Äôs in Art History who chain themselves to Trains or spray paint Stonehenge argue for that. Because they are extremely stupid people. You radically up various Renewables, increase efficiency on carbon based emissions, add some nuclear and develop carbon capture and offset further. Plus many other things such as circular economy ideas to reduce the driver of emissions. The global population (and the meat farming linked to sustaining that) also likely declines as we all progress economically and self limit the population to a below replacement level further dropping drivers. That‚Äôs already happening in the developed world. No one thing, lots of things combined in a complex ecosystem which still emits and absorbs carbon because virtually all life is based on carbon emissions. It‚Äôs all going to be fine and those who think otherwise are no different to the prophets of doom in the Cold War before it. We aren‚Äôt the final generation, we aren‚Äôt special. That‚Äôs ok."
"In Australia? No , absolutely never, even asking is stupid."
No
"We've got a massive ball of free, endless, gas in the sky and we can't yet harness its power so until we get better technology then No."

"In theory Yes, just need to get storage sorted out"
Battery storage large scale grid systems life cycle cost round 8-10 cents per KWh so wholesale renewable power is at times not free
"With a de-centralised grid, yes. With a diversified set of inputs e.g solar AND wind, yes. With significant government up front investment to infrastructure change, yes With financial penalties being applied to the energy industry companies who have consistently failed to meet minimum maintenance requirements, yes. With financial penalties being applied to the energy industry companies who have consistently failed to invest in ensuring redundancy in infrastructure design, yes."
Thank god Reddit isn't the real world lol
No.
"Yes, or very close, by overlapping different power generation methods. Use excess solar power during the day to convert water to hydrogen. Use that hydrogen stored as fuel to burn if you need to ramp up power generaiton off peak for solar and wind. Solar farms that concentrate heat could also do the same thing with salt, super heat it, and store that super heated salt overnight to steam turn some turbines like normal if required. Hydro power where it is possible, as we will always have dams, will be an extra source available at all times unless droughts. But you can do the use excess power to pump water into dam, and use that for power off solar/wind peak. Batteries for extra backups and storage where required. It really depends how much money and effort we put into it. You also got tidel power to harness 24/7, but I'm sure that is specific to the environment in its use. Same with geothermal. And even if converting all this to coal only because climate change magically goes away, or nuclear. Renewables are often able to be manufactured, maintained and installed by a reasonable level of skilled trades. And a tapestry of different sources that can be made here in Aus, localised to a great degree, also puts us better off if wars break out. It's easier to target and seize big powerplants, than spend billions of missiles trying to wipe out solar and wind farms across the country side and on every roof. We can rebuild those quickly using local manufacturing and installation, with resources from here. It makes sense on a national security level too. But also social cohesion, it tends to best not to allow key peices of nation demand into easily monopolised assets that can be privatised. Renewables can be installed currently without government intervention and subsidies by the private sector, which will allow for much more competition to keep prices competitive in future even if we get a 'big solar' complex or something. I can't see how we couldn't get 100%, just a matter of will. But there would be more or less efficient methods to get there, also depending on what you consider ""efficiency""."
Anything is possible if it is a priority. There are $billions invested in the status quo. Inertia is difficult to reverse. Parts of Australia will probably become uninhabitable for bovine livestock in future decades and this may be the tipping point for wide scale renewable projects to replace that revenue source.
"Could we go it on the grid? The answer is storage and transmission. And that doesn't have to be batteries. As someone that's been working in the industry this whole time, I've always been frustrated that we haven't had this part of the discussion. On one side we've had people shouting ""it can't be done"" and on the other ""more renewables"". But in the middle are people that actually know our generation and grid saying ""well it can be done, but more renewables at this point is not the answer"". Had we listened to the people in the middle then we'd actually be further along in this transition. the next big challenge is industry. Industry uses a lot of gas and it's not economic to convert those processes to electricity. At the moment. We need to start thinking about market mechanisms that encourage that transition from gas to electricity in industry."
"I 100% doubt it.... Our grids cannot even handle solar feedback. Power companies are going to charge a fee on feedback to store it somehow, if they get the legislation past.... They can't get solar power right. There was also supposed to be systems in place to use the gases from rubbish dumps to power stations....even burn rubbish to power stations...."
"We absolutely can and could be there already if we hadn‚Äôt dragged our feet for thirty years. Do not under estimate the power of the fossil fuel industry. The mineral council is diabolically powerful. It would take A LOT of work to achieve, dont get me wrong, not only in generation capacity but storage and grid developments, automation etc. people say ‚Äúits not economically viable‚Äù but firstly that‚Äôs largely not true, and also, that‚Äôs a notion of a false economy that values profit over people and wellbeing. I‚Äôm a mechanical engineer by trade but have also studied a lot of electrical, software, automation and power systems if anyone want to question credentials. Bottom line is if we just cracked on and did it, we could within 10-15 years. Maybe quicker with a real push"
No.
LNP/IPA voters allowed how infrastructure for power to be bought by overseas profit making comapnies...LNP/IPA voters are the dumbiest muppets on the planet...LNP/IPA voters have strangled all the things we need to manage our power and water...LNP/IPA voters wouldn`t have the faintest clue you can cover water reserves with floating solar and create power and reduce your evaporation while gaining negative carbon footprints...LNP/IPA voters won`t argue me cause they hate facts
"So the aim is 100% renewables, but the reality is our technology isn‚Äôt their yet, but this doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt paths ways to that aim that involve non renewables. Currently the government plan is to get to 100% renewables at some point in the future. But right now build as much renewable capacity cheaply, and support that intermittent supply with gas firming. Gas turbines can operate efficiently at various power levels unlike coal and nuclear, gas also can be stopped started with issues unlike coal and nuclear. This gives you the best of both worlds. You see a lot of Albanese working with the gas lobby, because currently the gas industry in Australia are marking absurd profits and the currently taxation scheme has loopholes that they are exploiting. This is very much a negotiation with the gas lobby, to get the best outcome for Australia. Australia was the number #1 gas exporter last year, so we have plenty of it, it‚Äôs just a matter of working a policy that both the gas lobby is happy with and benefits Australia. Dutton knows this so his current nuclear plan is to appease the gas/coal lobby, because everybody knows nuclear will take forever to build. This also hurts investor confidence in Australia, thus slowing down the growth of the renewable capacity."
Australia is a powerful and wealthy nation. We can do a lot of things however it boils down to Political will.
Norway is a full blown oil country
No.
Go nuclear lol
"I live off the electricity grid. With today's tech, I don't think 100% is possible. Maybe in the future. I'd thought of turning my property into a solar farm, but I'm 2 - 3 kilometres away, depending on direction, from the grid. Unless some power company is willing, I can't. Too difficult."
"Can we go? Yes, will we go under the current structure of government? 100% not, the deal for 2030 will get pushed back to 2040, the deal for 2050 will get pushed back to 2060, and so on and so on, just to squeeze that extra little bit of profit for the owners of the energy industries, because that is what society is all about, making a sliver of humanity 10 times richer by causing mass suffering and migration for the rest."
"100% impossible now. Any other suggestion is just total bullshit. See what happened to Adelaide when they got rid of their coal generator. Who the hell came up with that idea, with out any backup."
"I'd say not possible, for starters there is no sun at night or on cloudy days and the wind does not always blow. Battery storage is in its infancy and will never get enough to power a modern city /country . Drive around Sydney and Melbourne and see what has to use electricity. No other country in the world has or is going 100% -its just not practical"
"Nuclear is the first step in moving away from coal and fossil fuels, from there that can slowly be replaced by the other sources or advanced into fusion."
"It has to be storable. Battery technology and its efficiency/affordability is the only thing that makes renewable genuinely viable at the moment. You have to be able to store massive amounts of power while there is sun and wind, for the night time/winter. We still rely on mining finite resources to make ""nenewable"" energy viable, lithium, cobalt, etc. Big battery companies are exploiting African workers to risk their loves to mine this stuff too. What do we do when we run out of lithium and cobalt?"
Tasmania is basically there. Most places don't have sufficient or appropriate hydro capacity though.
"No. Let‚Äôs look at a distributed source network; do we mandate excess solar panels and batteries on new homes and pay for older ? And work on better lines, poles and efficiency ??"
"It's possible, but the big point is that all those who have gone 100% renewable currently have done so with Hydro. Wind and Solar are our biggest resources, but the tech isn't there yet to enable full generation on those alone. Tasmania is already 100% renewable on hydro."
QLD retains ownership of their networks. You're right about SA too though.
No
No
"Let me share a fun one with you that i'm sure engineers will love to fill in more details on. So remember the huge power outage we had in SA due to a freak once in a century storm? Where part of the infrastructure that couldn't possibly survive that category of storm, didn't survive it. So any person with logic and rational thought would go holy crap, that was a bad storm, it's impressive we didn't get more damage, and it's impressive we repaired that quickly. Deffinately inconvenient but damn could have been worse. We had a compelte dickhead named Stephen Marshall use it as a huge platform for his election that he was going to fix it so it never happened again because it was all labors fault you see. Had to unfortunately work with him one night to find out the person was dumb ass puppet being told what to say and what to think. He went to an engagement that literally happened to be an ENTIRE event full of engineers, technicians and so on, and as soon as he went on his platform of trying to bullshit everyone about how it was all labors fault and he'd fix it.... he had to have a room full of experts who actually knew their shit explain to him in much frustration and in using small words and child like translations to explain to him, that adding more power to the grid... can't do much when the delivery infrastructure gets wiped out. So after quite a bit of frustratingly explaining this to a complete dumbass and people literally having to draw maps going, if the line is gone, power doesn't go from A to B, adding more power at A won't fix it... he then went to the next event full of asian real estate investors buying up the state, to then announce the same bullshit plan from before to a roaring thunderous applause from the crowd because black out = bad, labor ""did it"" labor bad. To my shock horror.... you'd walk around town to find boomers, gen x'rs, cookers, even uni graduates reciting this bullshit with no logic or rational thought at all. So yeah... politics aside you have to remember the general public is like the rational consumer.... you'd expect logic, you'd expect reason, you'd expect people to have intelligence to figure shit out, learn and understand, right? Nope let's start a group chant and demand something that sounds impressive!"
"I'm not Australian, and not sure why this was recommended to me but... I assume much if Australia is sunny and empty, but I how much solar paneling would be require to power the whole country? Like as a percentage of land mass?"
"I'm not sure whether this would make sense unless anyone reading this can think in similar terms. On that premise, to give a credible reply, this is a too much of a general question to be well served by just a couple of sentences that could fit on the back of a Mars chocolate bar wrapper. And to be credible, it needs to be qualified, hence the long winded spiel below. The short answer is no. We can't just switch to 100% renewable energy. Not now and not in the future, neither as a single nation, nor as an entire civilization, and here is why. We humans have advanced to become the supreme race on this planet because of our intellectual abilities. We modify the environment and use the resources around us to the extent where we can physically intrude and survive in other environments that are otherwise hostile to us. We wouldn't have ended up as the dominant race if we didn't do that. On Mount Everest, we bring warm clothing and oxygen tanks along. In the Sahara desert, we ride camels, cover our skin and bring enough water along to cool down and hydrate. 100 metres underwater, we bring air and pressurized suits or vehicles along. But, by the virtue of being the dominant race on our planet, we have the tendency to displace other species from their own environments by modifying those environments, to then turn them into use for own habitat, leisure, or to grow our own food. At the same time, we also create and manipulate our own technology, which uses far more energy than any one single type of environment can provide, so right alongside it, we also bring our own energy, usually stored in ways that allow us to manipulate it to power that technology, which then allows us to achieve God-like physics-defying feats. Fly faster than the speed of sound, move about in zero gravity, or zero air pressure or no air at all, or even in places where water or soil pressure would crush us in an instant. Starting with the Industrial Revolution, we discovered the wonders of fossil fuel combustion, while in the nuclear age, we learned how to split atoms to unlock unimaginable amounts of energy. We are warm-blooded creatures, and our combustion-centric technology forces us to tap into sources of energy that, by the sheer amount and concentration of caloric power, are only available in limited and non replenishable quantities. For the amount of energy and other resources mankind currently uses, we would now need to have access to other 18 Earth-like planets besides our own. But we don't, so guess what? We are doomed to perish by the mere virtue of the way we exist and multiply. So, to think that we'd ever become a fully sustainable, living on 100% renewable energy, is simply too foolish, and our very own demise is not a question of if but of when. Does all this sound depressingly fatalistic? You bet it does. But I'm yet to see any credible proof to the contrary. In Australia, we used to have a decent manufacturing sector. We don't anymore. Worse still, time and again, various projects, both at state and national level, have either been started and not finished on time or on budget, or not finished at all, or at least not in the way originally intended. Other countries can get there because their national and social cohesion is far stronger than ours, not to mention that their financial and technological potential is far superior than ours. I could go on mentioning the various failed Australian projects that support my skeptical outlook, but this reply would end up being a book instead. However, it's worth noting that we also lack the kind of national resolve needed to overcome the various petty obstacles, simply because, in our haste to continue enjoying the kind of freedom other nations envy us for, we've also become too individualistic and self-centred to make the kind of personal compromises needed to act in unison for the greater common good. In other words, we're only a nation in name and historical considerations, but otherwise, we will never be able to unanimously elect the kind of government that would channel and coordinate that kind of change."
We're 1% of global emissions so it isn't that big a deal but we will absolutely get to 100% renewable. Then all we have to do is work out how to stop strip mining to gather all the resources to make all the renewables
Non renewable energy like fossil fuel is by definition non renewable. This means that eventually we will run out. Eventually we will have to be 100% renewable energy. So the question is not a matter of if but when. In the next decade? The next century? Next thousand years?
"It's a risk, the golden 100% number simply won't happen. 1) other countries that have done it were extremely small with low populations, non developed countries and 2) the mix was hydro/thermo as the backbone for the generation. Nuclear is also a risk. Logically what it may look like is renewables + coal/gas or renewables + nuclear for the next generation."
"I think we can, but whats the price? I believes this video goes well in describing al the expenses of going 100% renewable https://youtu.be/GHDr-5ZFEyw"
