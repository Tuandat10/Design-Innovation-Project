Anthony Albanese announces Solar SunShot manufacturing program to boost Australian production

comment
I'm very in favour of securing our energy capability since we are but a large island in the middle of nowhere at the behest of China and the US.
20 years too late unfortunately. We could have been the biggest solar producer.
"Not really, you would need to compete with Malaysia and the US both with better solar testing environments and manufacturing capabilities. Australia however is leading the software side of things (apart of one of the company working on software globalisation of Australian energy management) currently expanding into dozens of country with some countries energy having about 50% or more of nation managed by us or at minimum about 10% with the average being 30%"
"It's great to see leadership that believes in Australia. I put solar on my home 10 years ago and tried to get an installer who would use Australian made Tindo Solar panels but none would. I wound up with LG panels. Last year I put solar onto a shop I use to run and again, could not get an installer to quote on Tindo Solar. The problem is we have been so brainwashed to believe we cannot make stuff in Australia. I started my working life as a trainee engineer in the automotive manufacturing sector in a company that employed 1300 people supplying axles, engine valves, conrods, etc to Australian manufacturers. That company is long gone and there are zero people doing that in Australia. We can make stuff, we can make good stuff but the big problem is most of our companies are owned by multi-nationals and they don't want a workforce that works efficiently or builds quality, they just offshore and say stuff it. Australia needs to support Australian companies and STOP the sale of Australian companies to foreign owners who shut down manufacturing after a few years or put restrictions in place that make competitive exporting impossible."
This should have happened over a decade ago. Now we will be playing catch-up with major companies who already have a strong foothold in the Australian market. This will fail IMO.
Well that settles it then
"Damn, I'm super conflicted. I don't know whether to snarkily refer to this as SunShit or MoonShot."
fantastic. more of this.
"If we can't produce these at the same price or less than Chinese manufacturers then will we force industry to buy them from us, or even subsidise a huge amount of the cost throughout the decades? It's the same reason double glazed windows aren't mandatory for new builds, too expensive to buy from local suppliers. Everyone knocks nuclear because it's too expensive and takes too long, but solar panels/ wind turbines will take just as long and cost just as much due to manufacturing, power lines, and storage. There isn't a true cost estimate if you ignore all the small details and realities."
I’m in favour of renewables but isn’t our larger issue energy storage infrastructure and the ability to generate at peak times like around sunrise and sunset?
"Sounds dangerously like innovation, and we can't have that"
"Australia is able to do more than one thing at a time, right?"
Not really - in the industry we are working into home factories as batteries will now be put into homes and how they are configured with vary but on average a single battery setup as an example would have those energy stored and pulled when required to be used after house consumption has been deducted for example. In a two way configuration as an example: one battery may be exclusive for the home owner as a backup and the second one being used as an industrial capacity. Payments will be made to home owners if they opt into the configuration. They are also tons of other ways we are moving to solve these issues.
"Ps just to add to my original comment the goal is to reduce the need for non renewable energy sources until an elimination can be done. Australia could also look into tidal power. Also not sure why people are down voting you, you asked a genuine question and there is nothing wrong by with that!"
"We shouldn't be spending taxpayers money to bootstrap a low human capital manufacturing industry that we have zero natural advantage in. Germany spent tens of billions of dollars trying to become a hub for solar manufacturing. They succeeded... briefly. The Chinese stole their IP and undercut them with unit labour costs that were 90% lower. Incidentally, Chinese taxpayers are still making massive losses on every exported solar panel - because none of their technical knowhow is unique. It's just been hidden by one of the largest asset price booms in the world."
"Albo is the kiss of death, this will be a failure."
"Yeah, like the libs have improved anything at all, ever. "
"Great - $1bn of my money straight off to some of Albo's union mates who will soon start solar panel construction companies with government money and miraculously win all the contracts. Well done ALP. Where's the rage? If the Libs had decided that nuke was the go and gave all the contracts to Murdoch, you'd all be losing your shit. Albo does it = Strong leadership! Wisdom! On the right Side of history! Hypocrites."
"The rage is kinda stifled because it's giving ex liddle workers jobs, which also makes it difficult to say ""good job Albo, but a battery plant or a turbine plant might have been a better idea...."""
   
Business case is we use those solar panels for solar panels and use that big reactor in the sky for power.
I’d imagine a part of the thinking is energy independence. If we rely on an antagonistic foreign power for all our energetic generation needs then we cede more of our independence.
"Is there a business case for completely replacing our grid with renewables? Especially if keeping a coal plant burning cheap coal would be cheaper for more power? No. But we're not doing this because of business, we're doing it because we need to get off fossil fuels. The cost economics aren't exactly as important as people seem to think they are. Logistics are the main concern, with a domestic panel manufacturer they can import more raw cells which ship more compactly and at an earlier stage in the value chain. This would mean more panel availability domestically and lower prices overall as well as more of the value captured and taxed within Australia and less money going overseas. So even given cost economics aren't as important as people think this plan would have many cost economical advantages overall to solar build outs."
"Because in the event that we do become a nation powered by renewables, having sovereign control over supply protects national security interests as well as being a jobs producer."
I agree with OP. This feels like a waste of money for no extra benefit compared to just importing the panels from China. In terms of solar IP they most definitely have more and better tech. They have the economy of scale to bring prices massively down. Solar panels are not sensitivity tech in anyway and will always be available. If it is about jobs then just get China to built a manufacturing here why start from scratch and end result is it will be a lost making business.
Malaysia is the cheapest and second largest. China is actually more expansive than Malaysia and is the largest producer.
Someone forgot to tell Tindo about economics ;) https://tindosolar.com.au/about-us/about-tindo-solar/
"If the state and local government want to replace our coal fired power stations with hundreds of thousands of solar panels, then it actually is “cheaper” for the Australian economy to buy domestically made solar panels. When something made in Australia is purchased by the government, the cost gets recouped through taxes. Workers at these solar plants buy groceries and pay tax. Retail consumers buy solar panels and pay tax. Every domestically made part and material has tax involved in its sale. But if we purchase solar panels from overseas than that money is sent directly into the Chinese economy, never to return."
"China are also subsiding the solar panels below cost price to dominate the market. If there is a war with China, the solar grid is fucked, especially anyone with a charge controller which needs WiFi to be connected to the Chinese servers. The business case is energy independence. There are more costs than simply the sticker price And who knows maybe we can find a way to produce more cheaply but we have to start somewhere, and at least this is adding to the overall number of panels"
"Australia is a better chance of manufacturing solar panels than we are of manufacturing anything close to cutting edge chips. Chip manufacturing is also not dominated to the same degree by a single (potentially unfriendly) country, so there's less of a geopolitical imperative for us to diversify supply."
