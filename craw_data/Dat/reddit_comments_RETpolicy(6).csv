Taxpayers to subsidise renewable energy projects as government concedes Australia set to miss targets

comment
    
As if the taxpayer wasn't subsidising these projects anyway.
"Periodic reminder that achieving 82% renewables and a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 means closure of ALL coal power stations in the next 6 years. Currently there are 10+ plants not scheduled to close before this date, summing to 14GW of baseline power, or 25% of the entire grid. That's literally billions of dollars of infrastructure being retired, probably with compensation for loss of future profits attached. Snowy Hydro 2.0 (not due to come online before 2030) can fill 2GW of this gap. That means we are going to pay subsidies to get the rest built quickly, at a time when worker capacity to build new stuff is at an all-time low. It's an inefficient and inflationary plan, all in the service of a number plucked out of a hat."
You know what would be great? Taxing fossil fuel companies or reducing their subsidies to fund renewables projects instead.
"You're absolutely right, but Australians voted back in 2013 that they'd rather Gina Rinehart keep a couple percentage points of profit than their kids have a future. They'd to anything to fluff a billionaire slightly. That's just the people that we live with."
I was thinking as well.Hard to belive but taxpayers paid for the entire system back in the day.
"The fossil fuel industries certainly see it as a good investment to have the media (their pals in the IPA, and the relentlessly bullied and underfunded ABC) highlight the cost of public subsidies for renewables. Subsidies for fossil fuel companies? Tax loopholes that allow them to avoid tax on million$ in revenue? Ssshhh!!!"
Ask the state governments on the eastern seaboard - they're all using taxpayer funds to underwrite privately run fossil fuel energy stations.
"Thanks for the totally unbiased and balanced headline, ABC. Very cool. Really appreciate #OurABC."
I don't want to subsidise renewable energy projects. I want to BUILD and OWN them.
If tax payers put money into private projects then we should get equity in said project.
"Excellent, state owned infrastructure is exactly what we need. When the market fails to deliver it's the Government's duty to intervene, especially on something as important as energy security and emissions reductions. However, the money needs to be spent on energy storage facilities because at the moment solar curtailment during the day is the reason the market is driven away from renewables."
Arguing about subsidies or the private or public ownership of climate solutions is like worrying about what shirt to wear to the electric chair. We need all guns blazing. For many the biggest subsidy they pay on behalf of the fossil fuel industry is the increase in home insurance due to climate disruption . (if you can even get insured) Let' s call it the cost of pollution the LNP wants YOU to pay instead of the polluters. It is the 'carbon tax' that kicks the can down the road instead of encouraging innovation and action.
"The polluters are big business and they simply pass on any extra costs to the consumer, so the public pays regardless. You didn't think they would jeopardise their profits did you? However, if government implemented renewables through public enterprise, any public subsidy does not get wasted on subsidising profit but all goes towards the service provision. This is why the essentials should always be public enterprises, so profit is not leached into private pockets and away from productivity."
Better than subsidising billions of dollars of coal companies to open new mines. At least this is an investment for future.
I mean I’m not surprised we’re going to miss it as we had the previous government do nothing about it.
"While I am supportive of a transition to renewable energy, Labor needs to own the fact it set a target without a proper plan. I consider that misleading. And, I agree with the idea the energy generation and transmission assets should be state owned."
At the very least the poles and wires should be publicly owned. It's not like someone has a choice of which grid they can connect to
"First, these energy sources are transitionary, not renewable. Second, peak oil occurred November 2019, and we are in for a steep trajectory down, ending our cheap energy period, which has supported perpetual growth in debt. 1971, Nixon started an experiment which is now ending in failure. All fiat currencies hold no value. We have no other path ahead except a complete implosion. Global grown will collapse and interest on debt will not be serviced. It is impossible to reach net zero on our current path. Take solar panels, the largest producer of silver, Peru, and the third largest China, will be out of underground silver within a decade. The cost of solar panels (and wind turbines) is about to skyrocket at a similar rate as fossil fuel energy.  Time to end this game of pretend. Cut immigration hard, so to buy us some time. Nationalise Australia's underground minerals like silver and build our own transitional energy systems while working out what's next. Maybe Thorium reactors."
Australian homes already have enough solar panels to run almost the whole country. We just don’t have the energy storage which is the major issue.
"Australia’s Clean Energy Regulator reports that as at the end of February 2023, a total of 3.414 million solar power systems have been installed on Australian homes and small businesses. With an estimated number of 10.8 Million homes in Australia, this brings the total of all households in Australia that have solar panels to 31.46%. Each house powers three houses? Plus all the other non-residential premises? Incredible!"
"Rooftop solar has an LCoE of 100-200 dollars per kWh, by comparison, utility solar is anywhere from 1/2 to 1/4 the cost. Congrats on paying nuclear energy tier LCoEs with none of the benefits that nuclear would actually have."
Australian homes already have enough solar panels to run almost the whole country. It is not even close to being enough solar panels. We have a installed capacity of 32.9 gigawatts and a annual energy usage of 237.39 billion kilowatt-hours (i.e. 237.39 gigawatt-hours. The solar panels would need to generate 650.3 million kWh per day which would require a bare minimum of 54.2 gigawatts of installed capacity and that is assuming that the panels are producing that 54.2 gigawatts of power all 12 hours of the average day length over the year which won't happen. I would do the maths to figure out how much capacity we would realistically need (likely double or more) but I cannot find a good average value on how much power a given capacity will provide as it varies based on latitude and per installation (e.g. the orientation of the panels).
"No issues with taxpayer funded transition to net zero, but it looks like wind and solar aren’t going to achieve that any time soon."
"It's all about storage. The first Tesla domestic Powerwall was released in 2015, so we have had 8 years to progressively install solar panels and Powerwalls or equivalent on domestic properties and optimally utilise solar energy, yet only around 33,000 have been installed to date compared with 3 million properties with solar panels. Government should have mandated and facilitated the installation of storage and solar panels on domestic and commercial properties, to maximise solar energy usage, not solar panels only. In fact it would have been better for government as a utility to install solar panels and storage on domestic roofs at public cost and then charge the resident a power bill for it without profit and over a long amortising time period to keep the cost of electricity down, instead of expecting the consumer to pay for the generator and storage out of their own after tax pockets. Essentials should be provided by government as non-profit public enterprise, not subsidising private profit with public money. There is also huge scope for heating water to be used as thermal storage for space heating, via heat pumps, as an extension of hot water heating and storage instead of simply airconditioners that have to be run on demand and not necessarily at the most efficient time of day."
  
"If you're an LNP fan, notwithstanding the massively wasteful spending that occurred under Abbott, Turnbull and especially under Morrison, you really shouldn't say much about excessive spending for another decade or two."


We will likely see the introduction of climate sanctions or tarriffs in the near future targeting countries not pulling their weight in reducing emissions
The government is kicked out if their promises are not met.
"The state is the highest entity on the planet, so there is no recourse. We could increase emissions and nothing would happen geopolitically (at this rate). There are murmurs that the EU might economically bully smaller countries into it, but i'd like to see them try their luck with India and China whose emissions are still growing very fast."
    
Evidence? Vituperation does not an argument make.
"Cheaper and better doesn't necessarily also mean ""rolls out quite fast enough to get to a particular 10 year target"". The renewable share of electricity generation is growing by like 3 to 5 percentage points a year recently, which is very fast for a continental scale piece of infrastructure, but I think to get to the target it's gotta be like 6 percentage points a year. Annual percentage point growth in the NEM since 2020: 3.9%, 4.8%, 3.5%, 3.0% meaning from 23% to 38% in five years. If it keeps going like that it'll take til 2034 or 2035 to reach 82% instead of 2030."
"When you compare the costs you need to also include subsidies, including tax concessions, given to fossil fuel energy production. The concessions given to fossil fuel power production is much higher than renewables."
It was never going to be cheaper. That was up there with the cheque is in the mail and other similar promises.
