Solar panels - are they worth it?
"Have a standard three bedroom house and researching solar panels. Household isn’t home during the day, just standard peak times so to speak and weekends. All electricity- no gas, bill comes in at approx $600 for the quarter. The sales people are sooo good at persuading a purchase. I’m after realistic reviews and advise."

"Just calculate it yourself, don't rely on sales people. Look at your usage across daylight hours and work out how much you'll offset and how much you'll export. Probably assume no feed in tariff as soon there won't be. There's no one size fits all answer but generally you're better off with than without."
Probably assume no feed in tariff as soon there won't be. This also varies massively based on state too. Vic gets some of the better deals there
"Over the course of 12 months, my electricity bill pretty much halved (25% drop in winter, 75% drop in summer). My household is energy intensive too, so I'm not skimping on the usage. 4 bedroom home in Victoria. I'm not home during the work day either, so usage is concentrated in the bookends of the day as well as the weekend. It's lovely blasting the aircons on free power during the summer. The best 'set and forget' purchase I've ever made."
Plenty of friends have done it and basically don't pay for power anymore for a lot of the year If I had a house I would save up and do it ASAP tbh plus I just think they're neat
"Yeah, it's just nice to be able to run aircon our whatever without worrying about the environmental factor. Also, electricity is just going to keep going up too, I imagine, and rebates going down"
"Paid $1,800.00 for a 6.4k system and installed. Had it 10 months and electricity bills have more than halved. According to AGL, We've generated $1,454.44 worth of electricity since April 2022 so our investment is almost recouped."
"Wow, Can I know your installer? That is half the price I have been quoted."
"Try this site: I used the data to do my own sums.

"It will depend on individual circumstances, should be able to get what's expected output from whoever is selling it to you, and use that to price up what kind of rates you can get wherever you are. Bit of maths and you'll have your answer I went a bit overboard with our system. 8.xx kw system, best day in summer was about 55kwh produced. Also got an overexpensive battery cos I got caught up in the hype of the moment. Just shy of 30k set up, will probably pay back in about 8 or 9 years. Quicker if prices increase It does feel really good being able to use whatever at home, leave air-conditioning running and still be in credit at the end of the quarter"
"Got solar 6 months ago. We're home alot of the day and if we are not, everything is timed to go off during the day - pool filter, washing machine, dishwasher, hot water. On the interest free plan, paying it off over the coming X years, but it 'feels' so much better knowing I won't get a bill each quarter. I can have that oh so sweet AC blasting in SE Qld throughout the day without thinking cents and dollars. We plan to stay in current PPOR for some time, so it would pay for itself over time. After a while we kind of dropped the details in the maths and just got it... Overall, guilt free electricity use is a feeling that is quite special."
"it will come down to how big your system is and what you can generate during the day. I've installed a 5kw inverter and 6.6kw of panels which generate up to 45kwh/day, of which I self consume about 5-7kwh, thus can sell over 35kwh/day (and the break even is selling at least 25kwh/day to the grid at my current FiT). Don't expect it to add value to the resale of the house, but expect it to lower your bills. I treat solar as putting the money I would've paid to a CEO onto my roof to save me money in the long run, and currently my bills are always in credit of about $50ish per quarter, so it isn't a gold mine either."
"Sales people will overestimate the self consumption, usually they like to use 65% which is extremely optimistic at best. You'll need to figure out how much of your use will be during solar production hours and how much you can move your usage to that time period. For solar alone, generally payback period will range from 4 to 6 years depending on system cost, feed in tariff, $ cost/kWh and usage. For me i just wanted to blast my reverse cycle aircon during day light hours willy nilly. I calculated my payback period to be around 5 - 6 years."
"Personally i think its worth it. Power bills really reduced... if you can change some energy habits to daylight hours you get more benefits (eg cool your house in sunlight then turn off at night, dishwasher/dryer/washing machine in daylight). I think they probably sell a rosier pucture than what it is but in the ACT for example you can get a 10 year interest free loan to do it and mine will pay back in about half that time. They last a good 20+ years too, so worth it. Batteries are not quite there yet from a financial standpoint though."
"Installed a 6.8kw system with government rebate, totalled under 4.5k aud. Made that back in full after 3.5 years. I see someone above said tariffs wonâ€™t be around forever, but thatâ€™s the first Iâ€™ve heard of it."
"Itâ€™s actually worse than just no feed in tariffs - thereâ€™s talk of charging solar owners to push to the grid. Itâ€™s absolutely bullshit if you ask me - batteries are no where near economical enough to warrant for most households, so charging people for producing free energy for the electric system to resell is so stupid to me."
"When my dads friend installed solar his tariff was around 40c, now itâ€™s way less than half of that. So itâ€™s unfortunate to say that one day itâ€™ll be 0c"
"Check your appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer) - you should be able to set them to run at a particular time or set a delay start, so you can load up before work but they don't operate until middle of the day. You can do that with your hot water too (assuming it's a storage type). Get a timer installed and set it to run during the middle of the day and set the thermostat as high as it goes so you're using less volume of hot water. If you find you don't have hot water the next morning you can always set it to run for an hour or so early in the morning too - might be a bit of trial and error. If it's hot or cold, and your house is well insulated & sealed, and/or has some good thermal mass, program your heating/cooling to run in the afternoon sun to pre-cool or pre-heat your house for when you get home. These few steps should make your consumption patterns more juicy for solar savings."
Consensus seems to be they pay back themselves after 5 years. However that's just getting your money back. How long they last after this is debatable and depends on the quality of panels.
"Fortunately the warranty period on most panels and inverters exceeds the payback timeframe. Some parts are 10yrs, some up to 25yrs."
"Better off buying energy efficient appliances first. (HotWater,Aircon,Dryer etcâ€¦)"
"If you have a pool you can switch the pump to run during daylight hours which can be very helpful in getting bang for buck (in my experience). Our panels paid for themselves in about 5 years, but that was certainly helped by work-from-home, as well as the subsidies, which were larger 7 years ago."
"short answer: yes ! a bit more though: even if you're not at home during the day, you can easily set your main appliances to run during the day: dish washer: just press on ""start in 4h"" after breakfast laundry: bit of a juggling, but I usually launch a washing cycle early, so I can set the dryer in ""start in 6h"". during summer, you can also launch a 2nd dryer when coming home set your aircon to run during the day too ie: small things that do make the difference and make the solar panels even more worth it. disclaimer: I got hot solar water installed before the standard EV panels, and this is the best value for money: I can't recommand those enough!"
Solar hot water is definitely not worth the extra cost vs just buying a bigger solar system and using the hot water system like a battery.
No room for an external line?
solarquotes on youtube is your best friend.
For a 15kw system we get a $200 credit per month and free electricity. Yes it's worth it.
"I didn't scan the entire thread so apologies if anyone else has made this point: going with a solar panel and battery array is about more than bringing the electricity bill down its about energy independence (not having to %100 rely on grid electricity) and redundancy. This is best experienced during a blackout - during the day? you can just run off of solar to power the house no worries; during the evening/night? you should have easily stored enough in your battery storage to see you through the night, particularly useful if anyone in the house uses something like a cpap machine or oxygen tank and needs to be able to power them all night. It may take a while for the system to pay for itself, but I'd argue that energy independence and redundancy are reasons alone to install a solar panel and battery array. That aside, think about the fact you'd pretty much just be using the system to power your home during the hours people are home in the evening/night with little to no need to use grid energy. I can see that $600 per quarter cost drop dramatically, so long as you're diligent with making sure you're switching to battery storage, plus, you can always feed energy back into the grid during the day - it's not lucrative like it used to be but it should still yield something for your efforts (you'd have to look up the fine details to see how it all works where you live)."
Here in WA itâ€™s about a 2 year payback. Best house investment you can make.
"I installed a 6.6kw system (I think) about 12 months ago. It came with a smart inverter so I can monitor the cost savings. The cost savings in 12 months have been $1,250. The cost of the installation was about $8,000 which gives a payback period of about 6.5 years. There is usually someone at home 6 days per week. I have ducted air con which usually runs 24/7 in summer. I personally wouldnâ€™t rely on solar rebate tariffs because those have been trending down over the years."
Solar panels are a no brainer if you own your roof. I went from $1200 bill to $400 net credit per year. I paid $4000 for 6.6KW in 2020 and has now fully paid for itself. You have to shop around for retailer offering highest FiT. Powershop seems to have the best rates at the moment.
"Your payback will depend on how much power you can use during the day, as the rebates for putting it back in the grid aren't much nowadays .. not in Perth anyway. Eg: You might save 30c for every Kw/h you can use from your solar, but only get 7c for each one you put back in to the grid. Daily, I get about 40Kw/h per day from 6.6 Kw panels and 5Kw inverter over summer, but it drops to 20-25Kw/h over Winter with short days and sun taking longer to get over the trees / hill. Less again when its cloudy all day, but we don't get many of those."
Mine paid off in 3 years but someone always home running that damn AC ðŸ˜‚
"The feed in rate is terrible so I could be a better option to rig it up so you're good water system heaps up during daylight hours and you store and use that energy at night. This way you are offsetting water heating cost which is greater than the feed in rate. But as others have suggested, you should make your own calculations and not rely on a salesman to tell you how great they are."
"We pay like a $100 per quarter with 5KW solar system. Family of five, heavy gaming/TV usage and almost everyday of airconditioning. We have a dishwasher too. And do laundry almost everyday."
Bills more than halved but mainly did it for the environmental benefits (fwiw I got no government rebates or high tarriffs when I installed it and did no calculations on what I would save). Not everything has to be money driven.
"Living in North QLD. Our air conditioners are on almost 24/7 for all but about 2 months a year. Used to dread receiving the power bill and now, after installing solar, we're in credit several hundred dollars. We still pay $30/ week direct debit to the power bill and $80/ month to pay off the interest free loan we got to install, but when all is said and done it's probably one of the best things we could have done shortly after buying our house. It's become like second mini saving account. What we sell back to the grid offsets the loan repayment. It just doesn't earn interest sitting in the electricity account. We use a fair bit of power. When the wife and kids aren't home, I am. And when I work, they're home using power in some way. Plus, with the semi regular power outages we get, there's always power during daylight hours, and our fridges etc get whatever is left in the battery backup if the power fails as the sun goes down. More than once now our street has gone dark and we've been able to run the aircons and watch telly or use the PC's until power comes back. All while not worrying about food spoiling. For us, definitely worth it."
"Best thing I've done to the house was solar. Haven't paid for electricity in 2 years and generated enough to cover gas bills too, even with the low feed in rate!! My advice, get the biggest system you can afford/ roof will accommodate! Nobody says they wish they got a smaller system."
"Lots of people with good recommendations here. One of the best is to calculate your (rough) savings yourself. See solar quotes as others have mentioned. I've only recently got a system put in (6.6kw, 2 bed house, vic, no gas, mid reno so can't validate true savings yet), but it seems clear that it'll pay for itself within 6ish years even without a feed in tariff. The fact that you have no gas is a potential win: heating and cooling are typically the biggest power draws. This includes hot water systems. Some hot water can be put on a timer; guaranteed savings right there. If your home is insulated and your heater or AC gets used a lot? Put it on a timer and use solar to pre cool/heat before you are home. Don't even need to change your habits to move significant power consumption to solar hours for significant savings. But this is AusFinance, so let's put that in perspective with some napkin math. Let's say you invested $10k for 6 years and got a guaranteed 7% interest, and didn't have to pay tax on the gains. You'd have $15k at the end, gains of $5k. One way of looking at it is a bit over $800 per year. Now it's going to depend on where you are and how difficult your roof is to install on, but I'd be surprised if you can't find a decent system for under $10k that is capable of reducing your bills by at least that amount. It was a no brainer for me."
"5kw system. Say it generates 3kwh for 6hrs a day to be conservative for 250 days a year. Thats 4500kwh a year. Feed in tarrif about 7c so if you sell 100% of what you produce (very conservative) youd make $315. That same solar panel will cost circa 5k to install so youre looking about 6.3% return on you money in an absolute worst case. In reality you will probably produce more, and use some of it. So your return will be higher. Not many places you can get a risk free 6.3% return with upside for more. Get the panels."
Yep. Electricity bill is halved and the left over has been spent paying off the panels. We've got solar hot water too (roof mount Solahart) but often have the booster on during winter so it acts like an electric one. Had the panels for 5 years and they should be paid off by the end of this year. The extra produced and fed in during the day usually offsets what we use at night and I can run the two 7kw main air conditoners in Eco mode all day and not touch the actual grid at all because the 5kw inverter can provide enough to cover it. It was fun to watch my old spinning meter hold rock still while I used what the inverter could output. 6.6kw of panels on the roof.
You know whatâ€™s going to be more annoying is the difficulty you will have afterwards in really understanding if it is helping. Since the most value is in solar produced and used immediately it never shows up and is hard to quantify. We got solar. Shade from around 330pm which is not ideal. Still I think it paid for itself over about 7 years and now saves maybe 150-200 a quarter.
Since the most value is in solar produced and used immediately it never shows up and is hard to quantify. Surely your inverter can track what is produced and used internally...or maybe older ones cannot?
I do wonder what will happen in ten years. Will you not get as much of a refund as people still need to pay for power or the grid It's the ev issue and petrol tax.
"Within the next decade there will be a tax/fee in place, probably collected via municipal rates or similar. In the same way that water/sewage charges in many states are levied (even if they aren't used). You pay for the option of being able to connect to the water/waste system. The electric network will follow the same sooner than later."
"Yes, 100% yes. I havenâ€™t had to pay a bill in a while because we are $30 or more in credit every month. Me and my partner arenâ€™t home during the day and use stuff through the evening to night. Currently leaving the aircon on through the hot days for our dogs and still sending power to the grid. Use the government incentives and if youâ€™re local to the Wollongong region I can recommend a business who checks up and will fix anything asap."
$600 a quarter is a 10MWh at a 6c FIT. Probably shave your bill by about $150. Plus a bit more if you can bias to weekend use during the day.
"Solar sales people are optimistic to put it mildly. Check your local FIT offers and take a look at your own usage. FITs are usually much lower than what you pay for power so using your solar is the best way to make money off it. I make sure I run my washing machine, dishwasher etc staggered and in the middle of the day. Most appliances have timers if you're not home. Saving 5kwh doing this is worth a dollar I didn't pay for electricity. Exporting the same amount is 30-40c. My 6kwh system cost 7k to install. If I save and export 2$ worth a day I'm breaking even over 10 years. I can do that by using 5kwh a day of solar and exporting ~15kwh on average which is possible in winter and impossible not to in summer. I also claim my ""free"" power as if I'd paid for it on tax for wfh, which I don't know if that's strictly legal but there's an argument I would have paid for that power otherwise. Plus all the little things add up, I only charge my power tools during the day like my mower battery (so mowing my lawn is free), I'll use my reverse cycle AC to heat/cool until I dip below 2kwh generation and turn it off and coast for a few hours before turning it back on if necessary etc etc etc ad nauseam All the above aside the average generation of a 6kwh system is 8700 per year which at an 8c FIT is $700 which is almost $2 a day without doing anything. Bit of a no brainer for me."
"I will admit. We didn't get much benefit at our last house. Cause we were not home during the day much. But in this house? We do notice difference. Cause we are often home in the daytime. So we run everything we need during the day. Washing machine, air con, dishwasher even....all on during the day. So as soon as we got it? Our power bills here dropped. Also. When Solar started. Your panels fed back into the grid and you were ''paid"" for that feed in. NOW? different. We can use our own power being produced and only the excess we don't use gets fed in. Which is much better I reckon. We use our own power first? Then we only buy power if we need it. So that means at night time mostly. There is enough Solar during our days usually to meet our needs. It IS tough to weigh up because it will take you years to pay it off. As yet? Batteries aren't worth their cost. UNLESS I suppose you use a ton of power at nighttime? Then they might be."
"With the very low fees in tariffs now the only way to meaningfully get value is to self consumption eg washer/dryer/aircon/pool pump during daylight hours. We work from home and can use all the above. Also waiting on an EV to further use solar during the day. Our 12kw system is on track to repay us in 3.5 years as a result. If none of the above is you the repayment period could be long. Heating and cooling eats the most power so maybe you can get value from that, eg scheduled on/off"
Can someone tell me if I'm using 890kwh in a quarter nov-jan Is that alot? My bills only $350 of which only $250 is useage...
"Yes, they are worth it, although it takes time to recoup the initial investment. Our last monthly power bill was $1.80. Family of four, relatively efficient house. We put a bit of effort into ensuring our big power uses (washer, dryer, dishwasher) are used during the day, but otherwise just go about our normal lives."
"I have 8 panels on my tiny townhouse. My bills now are solely the fee for service from my provider give or take due to feed in credits. If i had a battery i could go off grid or go into profit. I dig it personally, and future me will thank myself for making the investment long before power bills become painful."
I was very disappointed when my inverter failed not long after the warranty period. The cost of a new inverter would have eaten the next 5 years of the savings.
"Recently calculated this for someone at work, he was looking at about a 3 year payback period based on 8-10kW system. This is in Vic where we get a rebate, plus the solar credits. The feed in tariff (selling to grid) is becoming quite shit, so definitely better to do sooner rather than later if you're considering it."
"Yes. Felt great yesterday in the heat, ac pumping along all day, dishwasher going and more and still had room to send electricity back to the grid. No guilt energy usage and zero cost during the daylight.
Electricity bills are less than half. Mine will pay off in about 5ish years but have a warranty of 20 years. I say fill your roof up with panels. Solar water is good too."
Short answer is yes if you're there for the long term. I bought a 10kw system with 11.5kw of panels on the roof. They told me I'd break even in 3 years. I've had the system for 3 years and the break even in reality is more like 6 years.
"Depends on system size but if your billed stayed the same you'd have roi in 3-5 years. But prices go up. If you wantnto be spending 4k a year on power, get panels. Even if roi takes a while, provided you don't finance them the cash flow feels better with sfa bills"
"we only have a small system 10 panels. but more than halved our summer bill and winter one is probably the same as before (7 years ago) now after inflation. we generate enough power to fully negate the summer bill, just that feed in tariff is stuff all plus charges etc. wintertime donâ€™t generate a lot in Tas we use a lot more power now too though as previously both worked and not at home, whereas now usually always someone home using power esp during covid."
Assume you will replace in 10 years.
So far it has been the best investment I've made . My only advice is to plan where the sun will be on your roof over the different seasons and what obstructions you will have. Then tell your installer where you want it. Otherwise they will plonk them in the easiest spot for them. Also learn about inverter vs micro inverter and what suits your circumstances
For most houses in Australia the simple answer is yes. There are free tools you can use online to check your roof orientation etc to get an idea of whether they'll be right for your specific home. Find a well regarded installer who has positive reviews going back a number of years. Ours had a 3 year payback. Bills went from $450 a quarter to about $5 credit.
"My electricity bills went from $650 per bill on average to $250-300. I had a chunk of money that I knew I was just going to blow on a new toy, and this was a way to invest in my future cash flow - because I knew I was goin to be broke in a couple of months!"
Yes it is worth it for 1:1 usage. If your never home and don't use it during the day not really worth it If U do go as big as U can afford
Have recently brought a place with an existing 3 kw system. Can I just buy new panels and a bigger inverter to expand the system. Or do I need to start from scratch?
Depends on where you are and what you pay for power. Mine paid themselves off in two years with Adelaide's power prices.
"absolutely it is, if you dont know how it works or want real data to do the mathematics, just request a consumption meter in the package, extra couple hundred but you wont be guessing anymore. You either pay up the dollars now or keep spending 3-4k back to the electricity bills for the next 10 years, up to you"
Short answer: yes!
"It depends on whether you are at home in the daytime. You can in Victoria get a free meter that can tell you. In my case, most of my power is consumed after hours, and without a battery, I doubt its worth it."
"We have a solar battery with our solar panels in the burbs. We had a blackout in the whole street tonight. The automatic transfer switch turned the power back on in 20 seconds and kept us lit for the duration, a bit over an hour but we could've gone all night. Several weeks ago we had a blackout lasting 6 hours... Seem to be getting them more frequently now. So yeah, it works for me and has nearly eliminated by utility bills too. But you need to do your own sums for your situation to figure out the payback period. Cheers."
"Yes, yes, yes and did I mention yes? They are worth it. Through a good company, not shit ones. Love my solar. I use air con during daylight, do washing etc all in the day when it's powered by solar."
"My partner used to work in solar sales. The majority of people who said ""it wouldn't benefit us as we are never home during the day"", use 50% of their power in daylight hours. Its things like the fridge and other random things that are left plugged in. Then there's a whole bunch of heavy power things that you'll do only on the weekend because very few people will do things like vacuuming during the night."
"My pattern of usage is similar to yours and I'd have solar right now if I wasn't renting. My reasoning: EVs are basically viable now as regular cars and prices will continue to drop. Most of them are ready to power the house or sell back to the grid during peak. V2G, two way inverters etc. We're at 20 percent of houses with solar now. EVs will apparently be 50% of new car sales within 5 to 7 years if demand can be met. If the majority of 500,000 new EV owners every year was to charge their cars, even if existing solar owners are overly represented among those buyers, that's a rush on solar right there. A marginal decision now will become a super good one before too long I reckon."
"We installed our system 8 years ago. We used solarquotes.com.au to research how to buy, what to buy, etc. and nothing on that website turned out wrong. We used the site to get three quotes from reputable installers. One bit of advice is to never buy from anyone going door-to-door. Good installers have heaps of work and don't need to do that. Our bill was around $500 average per quarter at the time, and we saved $250 per quarter. I was conservative and careful to only credit the kWh usage rate. Our system is in Sydney and 4.1 kW in size. Today it would be $600-700 and we're saving around $300-350. After proving, I stopped tracking it closely. Panels are well worth it (around 15% to 20% internal rate of return) unless you have serious shading issues. Domestic storage batteries do not yet have a positive return. There are more options today, such as switching water heating to daytime only (provided tank is large enough), so as to consume more of your own power. Domestic water heating is the most cost-effective form of surplus energy storage from solar panels. Some installers will upscale to include battery and show a positive return. It will be less than panels alone, essentially using the great return on panels to make the battery look good. They'll emphasise that being away during the day you must have battery. All flat-out crap to make a bigger sale. Don't fall for it. You'll probably use the timers on your appliances to run dishwasher and laundry when you're out. Your aircon likely also has a timer, so you can turn it on before you get home. Plus hot water as mentioned. Other options open up but may be too much bother. For example you can read your meters each morning and evening which can be helpful with choosing best energy purchase plan. Good luck with it. You'll be very happy with the numbers at the end."
"Worth it for me but I work at home, and do the washing,drying,dishwasher, type stuff during the day."
"It was definitely worth it in my situation. 4 bedroom house with Ducted aircon and family. away at work/school most days. Installed 13kw panels and 10kW inverter 1 year ago. Easy to get good numbers with a Smart meter which was actually required in my case. Hot water on timer so it only turns on between 10-4 when panels are usually generating. So far based on actually usage - average 214 dollars per month reduction in power bills, up to 300 per month in middle of summer. It is good to see a negative power bill over the school holidays when the air con is running all day.
Our FIT actually increased by 40% in regional QLD in the middle of last year which will improve those numbers further."
"Honestly, I barely think mine is worth it. FIT in NSW went to shit and I'm in an office 8-5 everyday."
Something else to consider if you're thinking you might sell before payback time. Local real estate agent adds about $1-2k per KW solar in valuation to places he is selling and that is based on what buyers want or accept. It is a key selling point now.
"We are a 3br/2ba house with 2a +2k. I work at a school so home all summer. Back to full time work for both adults now plus kids at school. We pay approx $100 a fortnight for our panels. Our most recent electricity bill came yesterday and itâ€™s $350. So about $950 for the quarter. Prior to getting panels our bills were $1000-$1500 for the summer quarter. So we are just as well off (slightly better) while still paying off panels. Once our panels are paid for (5 years interest free, 3 years to go) then we will be absolutely laughing. But even while paying them off itâ€™s good for us. I do as much as I can during daylight hours, but obviously canâ€™t do some stuff as Iâ€™m not home. For example, always run the dishwasher first thing in the morning when I go to work with last nights dishes in it. Also sometimes put washing machine on for delay start, have it ready to put in tumble dryer before I go to work. So that those things are running off solar. Turn air con on before I go to work and have it run all day on hot days, all off solar panels and it doesnâ€™t work as hard doing that as it does if I leave it off all day then turn it on after work when house is hot & stuffy already."
"Please correct me if I am wrong, but I donâ€™t see the need for solar for myself personally. At this point the elec companies are taking in free power from us if we install solar, theyâ€™re paying us 4c per KW, fk all for it considering they charge us 0.30c per KW and weâ€™re paying to install the solar and feed what we donâ€™t use to them, seems like the biggest scam of all time, they knew theyâ€™d lose money to solar. Yes you save in the day time, but whoâ€™s realistically home during the day? I get home from work at about 6pm and need the air con in the afternoon/ night.."
"Look, you probably won't get your money back. The other thing they don't tell you is that there's upkeep - cleaning etc - and also the utility decreases over time. That said, we did it, because we figured why not go renewable if you can? And we've adjusted some of our patterns to maximise - so set the washing machine and dishwasher etc to run during the day while you're at work."

Cleaning ?? doesnâ€™t it rain where you live?
I've run my real usage figures a few years ago and it worked out to pay itself off in 3-4 years. It's got a 10 year warranty.

How long do the panels last for? I saw an ABC report on TV a couple of years back where households were buying panels but were ripping them down because they are such low quality. How often do you need to clean the panels?
"My panels have a 25 year warranty and the microinverters attached to them have a 20 year warranty - I bought top of the range for the time to maximise my energy generation, because the layout of my house wasn't overly optimal (majority of panels are east and west, with only a handful facing north). So the better panels had a greatly increased efficiency, and also a better life time. As for cleaning, I tend to do mine every three years - there is a local business that will do them, and whilst he's doing the panels he will also give the outside of the house a quick clean. About $150 for three hours work."
