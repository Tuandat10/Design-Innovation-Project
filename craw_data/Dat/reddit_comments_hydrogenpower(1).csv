Australia opens $2 billion tender to support massive green hydrogen projects

comment
I can almost see Twiggy Forrest's enormous erection from here.
Ew
Classic case if the winners of these tenders already decided upon & they just have to advertise it like they are following the rules. Twiggy & Gina Rineheart have already been given the unofficial greenlight
"We need green hydrogen for making fertiliser/ammonia and in certain metallurgical industries (alumina, green iron and hopefully steel). Hydrogen is dead for ground transport."
Huge fan of green ammonia as a medium for energy export (in lieu of LNG) and as fuel for ships.
"LOL. The fucking plant in Korea your link talks about is a gas reformation plant, AKA the exact same kind of plant we're building. So yes, they produce it locally, using the gas they buy from us. For context, the Japanese plant is blue hydrogen, which is reformed from water using renewables. It produces less than 1/3 of what the Korean plant does, whilst taking up about 180,000 square metres and still needing to pull extra energy from the grid. Blue hydrogen is astronomically more expensive to produce and every ounce of power used in its production is power that isn't being used to reduce the use of fossil fuels for energy production. It is also super easy (well, relative to when it's used to generate power) for the carbon byproducts of green hydrogen to be re-captured and stored, rather than let out into the atmosphere. Oh, and hydrogen has a shit tonne of uses beyond just power, it's also critical in the production of fertilisers and all kinds of other shit."
"Waste of time, how about directing that money towards battery storage research. Hydrogen is dead, based on flaws, designed nothing more than to keep people going to a servo. Electricity is everywhere."
"So long as someone can control supply, they are happy. Can’t be having decentralised power. Need to be able to exert control somehow"
"Hydrogen is probably a better solution for the transportation industry. Batteries are just not there right now to be able to accommodate the requirements, they're way too heavy. The sooner we move transportation away from diesel the better."
"Such a waste of money, should be going to real proven renewables not a bailout for the mining industry."
"It’s a holdover from the previous government and if changed now will result in an insane amount of vilification from the press. I wonder how many more years of this we have to see, though…"
