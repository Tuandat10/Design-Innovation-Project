"Powering Australia with nuclear energy would cost roughly twice as much as renewables, CSIRO report shows"

comment
"Well, that's a guaranteed funding cut for the CSIRO if the LNP win the next election."
"The LNP doesn’t want Nuclear, they just want more debate to keep coal alive for another few extra years."
*another funding cut
"I think given our insane government decisions of the past, they will say they heard the CSIRO and are now introducing a combined technology system part nuclear part renewable but they also will somehow find a way that is less efficient than either of them individually and will cost 20x as much and we will eventually upgrade to a full renewable system later and they will all get bonuses and private sector jobs for their trouble. I just made myself sad with how likely this sounds."
Oh. The LNP who had disliked CSIRO saying nuclear energy wasn’t viable and started disinformation campaigns to discredit CSIRO over opposing views. Nuclear energy is a Trojan horse. It won’t work and it’s 42 years late for that.
"Oh, very easy in opposition, but strangely they never proposed this with specific sites for reactors nominated whilst in government. I wonder why not?"
"I don’t think the push for nuclear from the right has anything to do with cost effectiveness or environmental impacts, I’m sure it’s all to do with mining and ensuring Australia’s 0.1% become Australia 0.001% with the obscene wealth they could generate"
"I don’t even think many on the right know why they are pushing nuclear, they just know they’ve been told to and they will comply."
Unless we do it on the cheap. We could get rid of all the redundant systems and security overrides. That would cut the project cost in half. Who was the lead on the Turnbull NBN redesign? We can get them.
Dutton will just say csiro is woke and cut their budget again if he wins. lol
"I've seen other articles saying it could be up to six times as expensive too. Nuclear is no longer useful or required. It was the better way when the only other option was coal, but that hasn't been the case for years and years."
"Not to mention that amount of time it would take to get a facility up and running, which is around a decade, as opposed to only 1-3 years for renewables. Coupled with the fact there is no nuclear industry, and it would cost billions to build."
If we wanted nuclear power we should have started that process 40 years ago. It's too late.
"the report actually mentions the UAE ""started from a similar point of having an empty nuclear development pipeline"" in 2008 and delivered nuclear energy in 2021 (13 years) but also points out ""the UAE is not a democracy and therefore may have abbreviated some stages of permitting that will take longer in Australia due to the greater degree of public consultation in many of its governance processes"" I would say there is still arguably a decade or so of development SMR could go through to reach a good level of maturity so it's definitely not too late – but it's true there would be a huge runway, mostly regulatory and bureaucratic, before the first reactor even broke ground in Australia and of course that is assuming there is even the will to want to do it... I note High Speed Rail is something that everyone has actually wanted to see in Australia for at least the past 40 or 50 years – and we still have not gotten even past the planning stages on that..."
"Nuclear continually being proven to be not effective for Australia, Cost at least 8.5 billion to build and will be at least 50% more expensive then Wind and solar backed by Batteries."
And how many years away before the first lightbulb can be powered by it ...?
"Can’t monetise the sun, the wind or the tides."
"There's another sub on Reddit that has an article showing California went 30 days with 100% renewables. The uptake of renewables with increasing battery storage capacity will make nuclear even less feasible.  We need a truly national electricity grid,  funded by stopping ALL subsidies to fossil fuel mining and production.  And stop the fear campaigns that renewables cause black/brown outs. EVERY year we get the same headlines that ""this summer we're heading for blackouts due to renewables"". That's been about five years straight now, and we've yet to have one. The only blackouts have been caused by both coal and poles and wires issues, and severe weather events.......not by increasing renewables. "
"There's another sub on Reddit that has an article showing California went 30 days with 100% renewables. No, no, no. They went 50-something days where the peak renewables output exceeded 100% at some point in each 24 window. The period at 100% could only be 5 mins or whatever minimum period the Californian energy market uses. Impressive, sure (South Australia also regularly do this, especially in spring and autumn), but a big big difference between that and running on exclusively renewables for 30 days straight."
"Nuclear is one of the most expensive energy options out there. Then you have fossil fuels that are moderately expensive, and then you have most renewables, which are the cheapest. Renewables with power storage are about as expensive as fossil fuels without all the pollution"
"Without even reading this report, I’ll reiterate what I do in every one of these threads about nuclear power: power generation in Australia is no longer a generation issue, it’s a storage issue. There has been a fairly robust feasibility study done on these sites: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-21/pumped-hydro-renewable-energy-sites-australia-anu-research/8966530 Notably: Study found at least 22,000 suitable locations for pumped hydro sites Researchers say Australia could transition to 100pc renewable energy in 20 years if just a few of those sites were built You could built multiple of these sites for less than one nuclear power facility. The sites are also of varying size, they don’t all have to be Snowy Hydro 2.0, you could have smaller scale sites servicing individual towns."
"Barakah cost $A45B in 2011, so assume that would be $90B today for 5600 MW. Hinkley C is $A87 billion. NSW has renewable plans Almost 200 large scale renewable energy projects totalling almost 35,400 MW in our planning system, representing almost $50 billion in investment. Snowy 2.0 costs $12 Billion (ouch!) six times more than planned but provides 2.2GW (not MW) or just under half of Barakah but at way less than half the price. It is a battery that can be charged by that excess solar and wind power. We need more snowy 2.0 or batteries but you can see why renewables are so much cheaper than nuclear. Barakah was contracted in 2009 and started supplying power 12 years later. Given the likely delays in Australia you would be talking closer to 20 years or more before anything was operational."
You mean 2.2 GW for Snowy 2.0
"For starters, Snowy Hydro 2.0 isn't finished yet; the cost could continue to rise significantly. Secondly, you are ignoring the cost of building the renewable required to pump the water for Snowy 2.0, so it isn't really a fair comparison, given that Barakah does the job of both renewable generation and storage in a single package. Thirdly, where did you get those total costs for Barakah from? It cost $24.4 billion USD in total over the lifespan of the project. Why are you applying inflation to the entire project when it only finished commissioning this year? When you factor in the grid upgrades, storage, lifespan and maintenance costs, renewable energy actually starts to become as expensive or more expensive than nuclear. You are also ignoring the heavy environmental impacts of pumped hydro systems."
Ok now cue the Australian media to ask the same question of the opposition for months about how their key plan is a failure. Oh wait that’s only when it’s a labor policy.
"In case anyone needs further convincing, great video from Engineering with Rosie which sums up the issues with nuclear in Australia - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_47LWFAG6g"
"Don't fall for the ""baseload"" myth. https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2013/04/baseload-power-is-a-myth--even-intermittent-renewables-will-work"
30 years late to the party. Sounds very on-brand for us.
"From the article: But this time, we did an update and looked at the cost of large-scale nuclear reactors, and they're cheaper — on the order of $150 to $250 a megawatt hour. The article lists renewables within $100-168, without storage listed. So no its not 'twice as expensive'. Suddenly its pretty comparable."
"The article lists ""solar PV and wind with firming"" as $100-140. So the upper bound is lower than the nuclear power bound, and that includes some storage."
"If the nuclear age took off in the 50s and 60s we’d be in such a better position. But Australia’s missed the boat so renewables is a better option here. If we didn’t have the resources to go all in on renewables it’d be a good option. We don’t even need it for heavy industry power demands. Although if there’s a proven and working SMR - that’d work, but then again that’s mostly just to provide post-discharge career opportunities for nuclear trained submariners. (Which is important - it’d be hard to recruit otherwise)"
Surely we make do until fusion takes off. We seem to be getting closer each year.
"The only way nuclear will be viable govt owns and operates, at the tax payer expense, then give everyone access to the same price for electricity.. make it cheap... Real cheap. I'd rather have a couple of power plants than consume a shitton of land for solar."
Agreed. But I think we all know that the LNP’s plan will include a Private Public Partnership where the facilities will be owned by private companies. Probably an LNP donor. There will be a guarantee of high profit and the ability to charge as high as the market can bear. We’ve all seen how this has played out in every other sector. Privatised profits. Public losses.
"Best to let the taxpayers pay for it, then privatise it and sell it so it doesn't lose money. Socialising the cost and privatising the profits will guarantee a dependable supply of electricity. Logically the cost to clean up any accidents should stay with the taxpayers."
" consume a shitton of land for solar. Good point. People always mention we have an abundance of wind & sun, but conveniently forget about our lack of boundless plains to share build things upon. We'd have to infill some uranium mines & their exclusion zones just to make room."
"That doesn't make it viable, it just moves the cost from one bucket to another. We the taxpayers are still paying for it. It only needs about 1200km^2 to power all of Australia with solar. I drew it on a map. see that little yellow box in South Australia? That's how much land would be needed to power the whole country. https://imgur.com/a/NIiUPns"
And? It would make the Mates twice as rich. Mission accomplished. 
r/whowouldhavethought
"Im a bit perplexed about stance about nuclear here, so there seems to be two core issues with nuclear power as I see it, the main one is the cost of nuclear plants followed by potential waste management and also the LNP supports it so it should raise some eyebrows automatically. Let's not forget we are getting 8 nuclear submarines, with an estimated cost of $368 billion, so each sub will be approx $46 billion, which equites to 5 nuclear plants per sub or 43 nuclear plants for the entire aukus project. We also have to deal with the nuclear waste here in Australia as there is no agreement from the US/UK. I just think there a large degree of double standards going on, we can't use nuclear power to provide for the public, but you bet we will spend every dollar we have to use nuclear to power our submarines and we will use them on anyone who even thinks they can stop buying our wine, lobsters and coal... While I agree that the cost benefit favours renewables, i dont think we should discount the benefits of nuclear, if we are to get nuclear submarines, then let's develop a domestic pool of talent to manage nuclear power as well. If we're talking purely economic terms, then of course renewables have an advantage over nuclear, but I dont get why everyone here discusses this as if they're an econ major without highlighting we do a tonne of things that is not economically rational, we build car dependent sprawls and toll roads instead of medium and higher density housing and improving public transport, we do everything possible to inflate our speculative housing bubble, we keep coal plants running far longer than necessary to keep jobs, we buy nuclear subs when diesel electric will suffice etc. Not saying nuclear is the right approach but I do worry about the impending climate catastrophe, i dont believe it should be nuclear or renewables, I think both have their parts to play when it comes to switching away from fossil fuels."
You missed 15-20 YEARS to build one (we need many). The time frame is the key attraction for Dutto and Lib/Nats. Wake up!
"The reasons for powering submarines with nuclear power are due to operational needs. The point is to be able to have the submarine stay hidden underwater for a very long time. Other power sources can't do that. Diesel electric subs can only stay under for a couple of weeks before having to come up for air. Whether that is a necessary expense or not is a different question, but there is a specific need for that type of power source for that type of application. We don't need power for the Australian grid to be able to be generated underwater for 4 months in a row. So it doesn't make sense to invest a huge amount of time and money in investing in nuclear energy when we can get more energy and quicker by investing in renewables. The idea of wasting a lot of money to build nuclear power plants in order to develop a domestic pool of talent to manage nuclear power plants doesn't make sense, if we didn't need the nuclear power plants in the first place. If you want to waste money on developing skills we don't need, then how about we replace a portion of our digital phone switchboards with manual ones, and then train a pool of talent as phone switchboard operators so that we have that skill handy to operate the unnecessary manual phone switchboards that we installed just so we could have a pool of talent to operate them."
"Stop trying to make 'fetch' 'nuclear' happen, it's NOT going to happen!"
"Powering Australia with nuclear energy would cost roughly twice as much as renewables, CSIRO report shows Only twice as much.??... Better redo those figures because every nuclear project has at least doubled in price from announcement to construction..."
"Dutton does not work for the Australian people, his actions are solely to keep coal and gas around as long as possible and give big business the ability to keep price gouging us in the long term."
"He's a lizardperson hellbent on terraforming the planet Earth via climate change so that his brethren, hidden in massive ships in the Kuiper Belt, can someday take over, kill all humans, and colonise. There is no other explanation. "
"Moment has passed, we know it’s a delay tactic, time to move on. Embrace renewables LNP and actually drive the country forward."
"Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima... Humans are much too stupid for nuclear power. The one's still promoting it are both stupid and dangerous."
At what point do people just see the bullshit that comes from this homebrand Voldemort and his party?!
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-24/csiro-accused-of-sending-misinformation/101556858 Not trying to be a full on tin foil hat conspiracy theorist but I could see how certain financial backers would prefer that the CSIRO publish anti nuclear energy reports. The longer we spend arguing over alternatives the longer we pay for their oil and gas
"Nuclear is a horrible terrible deal for rate payers. PV, geothermal, wind with storage is the way."
"Demand average out between 20 - 40 GW, there is no economy of scale to deploy nuclear. The United states struggles to keep nuclear generators suppliers in business, this whole thing is just nonsense. Further more we don't have any manufacturing the requires base load anymore, most mines have their own supply agreement. We can get by with renewables and peaking pants, even without storage. "
nuclear energy is incredible and clean and i love it but unfortunately it just doesnt make sense for australia

Since we are down wind here in NZ we would be very happy if you didn't build nuclear power plants. Thanks.
Downwind means nothing. Nuclear plants just “make” steam. If anything the nuclearisation of Australia would clean this downwind you’re so worried about by taking coal and gas plants offline.
Dutton wants more nukes.
Solar with battery just makes more sense for residential because you can set it up pretty much anywhere and be ‘off-grid’ without needing necessary infrastructure to be connected to.
So much for conservatives being better economic managers.
conservatives being better economic managers. That's been a laughable lie ever since John Howard dribbled it out of his arsehole in the 90's.
"I wonder if it would help us replace coal faster though, even if it's more expensive it might be worth the cost Please note I'm 100% in preference for renewables, I just think the historical resistance to nuclear means we have been burning coal way longer than we needed to. I would prefer to spend more money now to avoid delays in switching away from it."
"How would it help replace coal faster if it is many times more expensive and takes longer to build than the cheaper options that are currently being approved (wind, battery, solar)?"
"and most of these studies don't factor in the cost of decommissioning, which is more than 2 billion per site. Not sure if this one does."
"This one doesn't, which was intentional by CSIRO (according to an ABC radio interview this morning). They said since all plants have their own decommissioning costs, and there were already enough variables in this report, they were not included in the scope."
No shit. NuClEaR.
"Chuds were boo-yaing about a Finnish reactor coming online and owning the libs without realising it took 18 years to build and was about $10b over budget, lol."
"Nuclear actually makes sense there. Parts of Finland have next to no sun during the winter. In Australia, the worst place for solar (Tasmania) is better than the best place in Germany. It's foolish to invest in something as expensive as nuclear when we have better solutions that we can deploy more quickly. "
Surely nuclear still requires huge amounts of heavy industry to mine and process the fuel?
"Idiots, it is not about the cost but the reliability and scale that nuclear power provides."
Fkin daffy duck scientists pushing globalist renewables game show ... cheap now but pay in control throught globalist manufacturing supply chain ... and no native nuclear interest
I mean everything is going to cost more as we are a nation of procrastination on pretty much every crucial issue.
Why not fill the void of the desert with solar?
I think we all know that nuclear power is just another 10 year handbrake on renewable energy and climate action.
"And Dutton the numbskull dismisses them as being left biased etc etc. He didnt cost his thought bubble, and he got found out. Dimwitted LNP!"
"So what is the associated risk with each possible energy source if there are global geopolitical issues and disruption to supply chains and shipping? We don't refine minerals and manufacture renewable energy technology or batteries in Australia. Likewise we are quickly giving up the ability to refine oil and gas. I'm unsure about our ability to refine the uranium we mine into a usable product? Problem being that in times of global turmoil, our need for energy will likely increase. For example we don't produce enough fertiliser in Australia to use on all our farms. Shouldn't factors like this transcend cost to establish?"
I love you! NEVER give up! /s
"We have massive deserts in the middle where no one lives. Fill it up with solar, like China and India did. This backward ass country and the retarded politicians."
If the nuclear fan boys could read they would be very upset.
It is very likely fusion will be running properly prior to a nuclear plant being fully built. It would be better money spent developing new technologies into batteries until fusion is readily available
What a shock 
Is anyone ACTUALLY surprised? We've been saying this for years
"Assuming our geopolitical rival, China, keeps the below-cost solar infrastructure flowing. Because we sure as heck don't make anything here, anywhere near as cheaply. Perhaps one day automation will solve this problem, but it won't for quite some time. Any true comparison should include the investment required to make our own energy generation infrastructure locally so we won't lose power in a time of conflict. Which is currently entirely feasible with coal, nuclear and gas. In Australia's case the very least we need is to be able to make the batteries and solar cells in volume, and possibly the inverters also. We can license the technology - but production to at least service Australia needs to be located on our shores. It is this production that should be the cost basis for comparison. This question must be answered before we can dismantle our fossil fuel energy grid."
The LNP only looks at profits for their mates Some cunt would make a tonne of money with nuclear
Print that money and build it ... it's fkin existencial lol ... im sure bitcoin will eventually make it happen sonewhere else ... dumb cvnts with their weak ass yields and high pollution intellectual cowardice
"Sadly, the fact that experts armed with facts say something is more expensive and stupid means absolutely nothing to the LNP. Look at the mess they made of the NBN and the fact we've now spent way more than we ever would have under the original plan."
"The entire report is quite lengthy, and I'm not sold on nuclear one way or the other, but isn't it disingenuous to say renewable better than nuclear? They do completely different jobs. Nuclear is a replacement to ""always on"" power options like coal and gas. Renewable, largely, are dependent on weather conditions and, in the case of solar, time of day. The argument is about nuclear/gas/coal vs energy storage in the form of maaaassssive lithium battery storage farms which come will some pretty significant negatives - mostly their insane environmental impact from the mining, processing and then replacement every 10 years or so."
More cleaner though.
"Nuclear must be part of the renewable mix to provide stable energy. With coal and gas going away we need a way of dealing with the ups and downs of solar, wind and waves production."
Batteries!
Renewables cannot supply reliable power we need stable base load power supply. I hate this argument.
"Base load was an argument. Batteries are growing and do the job. They already can provide ""baseload"" for 2 hours in California (~20% of Australia's electricity generating capacity) and they're just getting cheaper and world capacity is doubling every few years. Change happens suddenly, then all at once. https://reneweconomy.com.au/battery-storage-becomes-biggest-source-of-supply-in-evening-peak-in-one-of-worlds-biggest-grids/."
"It's a bit disingenuous of a comparison since you need batteries to make solar/wind comparable with nuclear. If you could replace gas/coal with nuclear as backup for wind/solar that's a pretty good solution. Of course, this is assuming Dutton is actually serious about doing nuclear and not just throwing shit against a wall to see what sticks. There's no chance of there being an actual policy behind what he's saying."
"Why do you need to have nuclear as a backup for wind/solar instead of batteries, which are currently getting cheaper and adding 10+ GW per year at an exponential rate? That's already basically 2 nuclear plants a year and at current trends projecting an additional 170 GW per year by 2030. That means if you want to build one new nuclear plant in Australia, by the time you got one up and running say in 2040, the world could have built dozens of equivelant generating capacity solar & battery storage for a fraction of the price."
"It's a bit disingenuous of a comparison since you need batteries to make solar/wind comparable with nuclear. Not really, there's always the possibility of using part of a solar PV farm installation as solar CSP and storing thermal energy in large tanks of molten salt and then generating electricity at a time of your choosing by getting that hot salt to turn water into steam and running a turbine attached to a generator. https://theconversation.com/batteries-wont-cut-it-we-need-solar-thermal-technology-to-get-us-through-the-night-203545"
Honestly let’s just build one and see how it goes. Diversifying the energy is a good option anyway. There’s dumber things to spend tax money on
"Okay, so how are you going to turn intermittent power into baseload? Please say batteries, I need a good laugh"
"I think we should do it, it’s ridiculous nuclear power hasn’t been in Australia for years considering what stable cratons Australia has as well as uranium stores. I don’t care if it take 15 years, 15 years for a clean future not as reliant on rare earth metals or producing as much waste with old batteries/solar panels not to mention production cost? Hells yes."
As long as you're happy to pay the extra costs.
"""So nuclear is slow and expensive and is risky when it comes to the reliability of Australia's energy system"" Unreliable compared to wind and solar? Then there's the ongoing costs, there's no way this is a legit report. Does this look good for the environment? I hate seeing it even without the damage. https://x.com/JohnLeePettim13/status/1791314072459239886"
I pay more money for good food. Do it!
"Yep, we should still invest in nuclear as an alternative to stable base-load infrastructure while the technology to allow an entirely renewables based grid is developed. But we're far too late for it to be our saving grace."
How will that work when the renewables grid will be built before the first nuclear plant comes online
"Sigh. Not that anybody here cares, they've picked their tribe and all - But CSIRO's figures are extremely misleading. They don't factor in the extreme majority of transmission or storage costs. And then everybody cites CSIRO's figures and pretends renewables are much cheaper. It's a little long (so again, it won't be bothered with by people who love to express their opinions without doing research i.e. most redditors), but I highly encourage those who want to understand the situation to watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-GwnPWTwmU - I understand scepticism on this, but one need only look at the report and see what the assumptions are, and the open admission they're ignoring huge infrastructure costs, to understand why the renewable vs. nuclear comparison is useless without the sum total holistic costs being calculated first."
Is that you Peter?

found the Alcoa PR guy
This needs to stay top comment
   
"Dunno what you're talking about, large scale nuclear is on the ABC website. They even say it's the ""large scale nuclear"" that's twice as expensive, not the even worse SMR."
I'm not sure if we're reading the same article -- large scale nuclear is what the story is about? There's even a graph on the story showing that data
