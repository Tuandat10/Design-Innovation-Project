"Australia’s subsidies to fossil fuel producers and major users from all governments totalled $14.5 billion in 2023–24, increase of 31% on the $11.1 billion recorded in 2022–23"
"https://australiainstitute.org.au/report/fossil-fuel-subsidies-in-australia-2024/

Imagine that was spent on building houses to be sold at cost for the benefit of us all.

Edit:

The Fuel Tax Credits Scheme costs the Federal Budget nearly $10 billion per year and largely benefits iron ore and coal miners.

Researchers at the OECD, IEA and IISD describe it as a fossil fuel subsidy. The OECD has called for its elimination. Australian Government and mining industry representatives dispute the use of the term subsidy, but not its cost to government or benefit to miners.

comment
Just going to point out slightly misleading as any company or business can claim back the fuel tax as the fuel tax is meant for vehicles used on the public road and not on private property. So we don't actually pay them anything they simply claim back the tax they paid on fuel.
"We only give renewables 2.7 billion by comparison  If we taxed fossil fuels exports properly it would be an easy 50 billion, we could easily reinvest in green energy sources Anyone who's lived around a coal plant knows how vile they are, how toxic they make the air, how sickly the towns around them are, the health of the workers, etc."
Capacity investment scheme alone is going to cost vastly more than 2b. The states have all been spending huge amounts too. 
"Most of that $2.7b is actually given to them, though, as opposed to the so called subsidies OP is referring to which is mostly made up with tax offsets that don't result in money being handed to the company, rather they result in the company having lower taxable income."
"When a correctly educated person knowingly and deliberately attributes some form of ""cost"" to an unapplied, uncollected, or otherwise reduced taxation amount, you should know straight away they have an agenda of some kind, because they are full of shit. A reduction of revenue is not a ""cost""."
"Most of this is just fuel tax credits, which is not really a fossil fuel subsidy, but don't let facts get in the way of a good story."
"There are lies, dam lies, and then there are statistics"
"Haven't read the story but I'm guessing they are disingenuously including rebates in these ""subsidies"" yet again. But hey I'm sure they can find a fact checker to make it true."
"If we exclude the 9.6 billion of fuel credits, that leaves 4.9 billion of subsidies. The fuel credit is designed to ensure vehicles that work off road do not pay fuel excise which in theory is used for roads. From the remaining subsidies, many are tax deductions that are available for any business type. Note they don't net off total fuel excise collected"
"year ended 2023 $31.47b in royalties was paid to state governments. A little context helps in beat ups like this. Without the subsidies some projects aren't viable therefore won't generate royalties. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1406713/australia-royalties-paid-on-minerals/#:~:text=Australian%20mining%20companies%20pay%20royalties,the%20share%20varying%20by%20mineral."
Privatise the profits Socialise the losses
What losses?
Why does this piece of misinformation keep getting posted by people that never read the report.
"The Fuel Tax Credits Scheme costs the Federal Budget nearly $10 billion per year and largely benefits iron ore and coal miners. Wrong (from your own source) https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FFS-1.png If your argument is the FTC credit is a subsidy to fossil fuel companies, it is also a subsidy to renewable producers given you need coal and steel to manufacture renewables."
Thank goodness! Imagine how much more energy would cost without these subsidies
Man's walked in here and cut some nice jib. And then some people who actually know what the fuck is going on here slapped him in the face and walked home out of the building. Mm. I love the marketplace of ideas. How about we stop subsidising any industry? If it can't survive on its merits it shouldn't be alive at all. This is how you make a GM kind of fuck up.
"It's not a ""cost to government"" the government isn't paying a cent. It's simply not charging a road user tax on fuel that inst used on the road. Stop spreading these lies."
"You still wouldnâ€™t be able to afford a house if these so called subsidies are removed. Imagine the increased cost of power, fuel , transport , shopping, food , housing costs etc if the cost of power went up and up. Why donâ€™t we just remove all the billions upon billions of subsidies given to intermittent useless so called renewable power"
Headline talking about subsidising fossil fuels. Letâ€™s not jump to any conclusions â€¦ and itâ€™s from the Australia Institute.
Oh I'm so glad.
Itâ€™s hard to believe that people still believe this ridiculous propaganda from the Australia institute. Truly mind numbing stuff.
"Ad hominem attacks, no substantive argument. Domestic debate about Fuel Tax Credits Scheme remains dominated by the question of whether the scheme counts as a fossil fuel subsidy. However, at least internationally, the debate is settled: the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme is labelled a subsidy by the OECD, the International Energy Agency, the International Institute for Sustainable Development, the Overseas Development International and Oil Change International. Other organisations adopt a definition of subsidy which would include the FTCS."
"Imo, anyone who is thinking of falling for the scaremongering of Gina and the mining companies just needs to see how â€˜badâ€™ the oil and gas industry is doing in Norway and then have a look at their sovereign wealth fund. https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/norway-shows-how-australia-can-get-a-fair-return-from-oil-and-gas/"
This is the biggest single scam ever to have occured to Australians and Federal and State Govts are the criminals. Allowing Gas and Oil resources to be exported without proper compensation and then the filth laden ex fuckstick politicians who made those decisions are immorally able to have well paid jobs by those very companies handed the contracts. I Hate Politicians. Cunts
"So theyâ€™re stealing our money and our resources? Good going, Australia."
More of John Howards tax cuts for the rich. That man truly is a stain on our history.
It's not a cost to govt. It's a cost to taxpayers.
"The norwegians tax oil and gas export profits at 78%. And put this money into a sovereign wealth fund.
Its worth 1.71 trillion dollars now. and holds approximately 1.5% of all publicly traded company stock worldwide. We are fucking morons."
Oh so I suppose you are voting for the Australian government to develop fossil fuel projects and take on all the risks with tax payer money like Norway did then ?
"Most people are struggling with rental, food, etc How many houses can we build with 14.5 billion? The median house price in Sydney 2024 is 1,627,625 14.5 billion / 1,627,625 = 8908.69 median priced house Our gov is transferring this amount of wealth to private (likely foreign) entities each year as we struggle, is government committing treason? How do we make them accountable for whatever this crime is"
"How many houses can be built if the government stopped giving people a tax refund? Because thatâ€™s what this article calls a subsidy, fuel tax credit refunds, that any company can get."
 

"Why is the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme a subsidy? Fuel excise pays for roads that primary producers don't use (nominally), so they get it refunded. People building solar farms in the middle of the desert get the credit too, I assume, if they are operating on private roads."
And how much tax did these dead beat companies pay ? Along with how much profit they made ? And how much actually went to the average australian ?
At least $100Bâ€¦â€¦.
Send in the newscorp troll goblins
Fucking shits me
State government royalties and taxes on mining resources havenâ€™t increased since the sixties (and itâ€™s a pittance) and weâ€™re dishing out subsidies in the tens of billions? Something wrong with the picture
Also need to consider most of those companies are also the ones investing in renewables to diversify their portfolio from a loss of said fossil fuels usage.
"Can someone explain these subsidies? Like surely there's a justification for them? It just seems to me like a complete immutable business. If i was a tech company, no way would I set up in Aus with high labour costs and poor infrastructure, I'd need an enticement but resources have no choice right?"
If that money wasn't provided you wouldn't have power. Building houses is a lot harder without power.
"Lol, what on earth makes you think that is true."
Australians - Confidently stupid and entitled If Raygun wasnâ€™t the most apt representation of the Australian populationâ€™s overconfidence and denial of reality I donâ€™t know what is.
We can afford to build nuclear energy clearly.
We really are a backwards place. Welfare for the mega wealthy and most just sit and nod in obedience.
And loads of them argue for it! Proper boot lickers.
Why???????
"I'm all for renewables. I haven't dug down through your numbers, but can we make sure we aren't combining processes like mining for lithium and iron ore, into the same category as mining for coal or extracting gas? To have a genuine conversation on the green'ness of our subsidies, we need to separate the two. We want to incentivise extracting iron ore and lithium on the global stage. Not so much the fossil fuels."
Its the usual Govt. 'economic growth' cult thinking. GDP at all costs.
It should be nationalised
How much do you think that would cost?
And the rest.
What rest?
"Canâ€™t have Gina, twiggy and the other fossil fuel behemoths going hungry. What with how hard they toil in the fields each day ðŸ˜‚"
 
Imagine thinking Australia doesn't need more houses. Guanyin must think you're a fool.
