A wind farm in NSW. This is what I do for a living; Constructing wind turbines to harness renewable energy and making this world a better place to live!

"Don't your ears bleed from all the intense ""infrasound"" you get from being around the turbines? You must suffer from crippling headaches and other nondescript illnesses from the ""infrasound"". Isn't it about time you woke up and smelt the healthy sulphur-rich coal smoke?"
"The thing people forget about in fossil fuels vs renewables is.. everything aside from ghg These turbines arent going release tonnes of dust into the air and spark respiratory problems. They arent going to fuck water tables and compete with farms for water licences. They arent going to to produce crazy amounts of noise from the mines, to the trucks and trains, to the ship loaders. The list of environmental issues renewables avoids is massive, people should be more aware of them in energy debates"
"It must be a fabulous feeling when you drive away for the last time and see the huge giants in the rear-view mirror: ""I made that!"""
I'd love to do this for a living. What qualifications do you have\need to be able to do this?
"u/wind_dude6 added to the conspirator list, just in it for the money! /s"
"You do realise that all these wind turbines blowing in one direction will eventually reverse the rotation of the earth causing massive earthquakes, tsunamis, and the eventual extinction of the human race."
"Fine work, sixth Dude of the Winds, fine work indeed!"
"To misquote a bunch of yanks, ""Thank you for your Service""!"
Do you ever feel guilty about all the 'wind farm disease' you help cause?/s
How do you get in to the industry my dude? Is their much of a demand for workers?
You are a fucking legend .. be righteously proud.
Thank you very much! I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm a part of a good thing!
"The way OP is repeatedly completely missing/dodging the jokes about ""infrasound"" and ""wind farm disease"" is starting to make me worried ;)"
"Infra sound is caused by generators, transformers and current carrying conductors which is a hissing noise/sound you hear when are you are near them. If you go near a substation, power lines you can hear that too. In saying that, we aren‚Äôt effected by it because when a human(s) is working in a turbines it‚Äôs must be ‚Äòshutdown‚Äô for various reasons and hence no sound! And there isn‚Äôt anything like wind farm disease, people are sacred by unknown would say and this is one of those things :) and yeah I‚Äôm an engineer and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know everything and I‚Äôm still learning‚Äù"
"He's an engineer, mate."
"I call BS. There are no jobs in renewables, only in coal mines. - Average Australian voter."
Awesome!
Do you have to mark yourself safe from windmill cancer on facebook everyday?
I‚Äôm not afraid to accept it but you need to know that coal resource is coming to an end in the world!
"Great job. I'm in solar. I'm hopeful that if we continue to do a good job, they'll stop digging massive holes in our beautiful country."
Coal miners must hate you.
Can‚Äôt make everyone happy ;)
"""This one simple trick can generate enough free electricity to power a whole city! Coal miners hate him!"""
"You must sleep very well at night, I envy you."
Is that Silverton?
I can‚Äôt say where it is but would say you are wrong as well.
"New machines deigns are much better and don‚Äôt make loud noise. Think, future generations don‚Äôt need to worry about breathing smoke or holes in ozone!"
Beautiful sight
I love what you do! Keep it up
They'll build them in north QLD when they're powered by coal. And made from coal.
Hahah I‚Äôm afraid we can‚Äôt do that
I lived right next to (walking distance) a wind farm growing up and have never experienced any of the negative effects that people talk about. Windmills are things of pure beauty and one of human's better inventions.

Congratulations. good eco-friendly means of livelihood
"Joe Hockey said ""Wind turbines are a blight on our natural landscape"" Not like our beautiful coal mines. /s"
That's fabulous. Can I ask why solar panels aren't installed on the ground within the area of the wind farms? All the electrical cabling for transmission of the generated power is already there. All that'd be required is the connection of inverters into those circuits. That'd increase the generation of power without any additional usage of land.
Solar produces DC and wind turbines produce AC combination of DC to AC does requires additional equipment and these WTG‚Äôs are on hills so positioning solar panels is hard and is not ideal.
There will be lots of design issue that come into play and combining solar and wind is bit harder because of the harmonics
"I've been up to the top of one, pity because of shit weather i didn't get to go out. I wish i kept that job, but certain shit circumstances meant that i couldn't."
Huge pat on the back.
What farm is that?
This post gave me windmill cancer /s
"Soooooo, how much materials and energy to create those materials is needed to make it? Will that out last it's life span? Serious question."
Full size wind turbines cost a few million to make. They take about 8 months to pay off - depending on lots of factors of course. Nobody in the world would be building them if they didn't pay themselves off.
"I don‚Äôt know how much material are consumed, I‚Äôll learn about that and let you know. They are supposed to last 20 years and after that we‚Äôll need to do some upgrades!"

Hey. My dad does the same thing. He's currently in Perth
"u/wind_dude6 I just want to say that what I think you‚Äôre doing is awesome. Also got a couple questions, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, could you give a ball park on the annual pay you receive in this industry? Also, is it possible to get into this industry through means other than uni? Such as going through tafe and getting an electrical license? Just asking as I‚Äôm about to begin going through tafe to hopefully receive an electrical license at the end of it and I‚Äôm very interested by this field of work. Cheers mate!"
I‚Äôm making around 100-120k and this is my first job mate. Would say try apprentice at a wind farm which would be ideal for you to get started!
Sparkies are in high demand in the industry but there is also a large component of mechanical work. See if you can get on a construction team that will put you through your tickets and then you can progress into operational work. (15 years in the industry with no degree - sparky by trade)
"Where is this? A wind farm went up near my small town a year or so ago and I can see them from my in laws house, really cool!"
Jeez. Good thing the Libs got back in. Big investment coming renewable energy industries way. Especially the leg up they got from Clive Palmer to beat Labor out in Queensland. They owe Clive big time so I'm sure heal expect renewables to get a big push. Good on ya though! We need more of you. üëç
Cannot tell if sarcasm?
Do you have a moment to talk about the lord and saviour Lord ‚ÄúScummo‚Äù Clean Coal?
Real-world karma farming.
Thank you for the great work you do!
I‚Äôm a huge fan!
Still don't understand how Australia doesn't have more than 50% renewable energy. You have so much land that isn't being used with soaring sun. Glad to see Australia finally going the step
Australia is just growing its renewables industry and we need to use the land we‚Äôve got here. There is also a chance if we go over 100% renewables we can still have more renewables generation and export it to Asian countries where the lands is scare!
I farm wind in the day and karma points in the night.
I gave you one as well :)
You do realise that in the average wind turbine there is ~300 tonnes of steel. It takes on average ~700kgs of coal to produce 1 tonne of steel. Cement is typically made from 20-30% fly ash which is the by-product of coal fired power stations. There is on average ~1200 tonnes of cement used..... I‚Äôm not saying coal is the answer by any means I‚Äôm simply highlighting that it‚Äôs all well and good to say drop coal and do this instead when in reality there is need of significant investment and research before the transition can actually truly be made.
Awesome work. Congratulations. Clearly you're not on any of Joe Hockey's old driving routes.
This waste of time costs more to build than ever can be recovered with the energy it produces. FACT
Blight on the landscape /s
Thanks mate I‚Äôm only trying thou and legend is too big thing!
I find it interesting that with the slow pivot to renewables our power costs (per KW unit) doesn't appear to be getting any cheaper?
I‚Äôm not sure about the cost increase/decrease but I‚Äôm sure if use renewables it‚Äôs sure your spending/contributing your money on good things.
"Genuine question. How has the technology improved, if any. A report from the U.K a few years ago by Prof Gordon Hughes at Edinburgh University, said that while the U.K government and wind turbine companies are planning on them lasting up to 25 years, they are actually lasting only between 12-15 years with the most electricity produced in the first year alone, before dropping off over time. The report said that this would make the electricity grid unstable without coal fired baseload power to take up the slack and unable to rely yet solely on renewable power alone. And push up consumer's power prices with the need to tack on charges for the subsidies needed to replace turbines at a faster rate then expected. Has anything been done to improve this?"
There are many issues from grid side but we ask developing and these machines aren‚Äôt perfect yet and one day I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll get there! There are constant improvements happening.
Can we please have more posts like this? Heartlifting to see a positive post at the top
Teach us your ways.
"Good work mate. My mob are more about the sun than the wind, but it's good to see projects getting up across the board. Federal politics aside there's still support in the states and territories, as well as private investment. Hopefully we can all ride the wave and save the world at the same time."
Hey u/winddude6 the real MVP is the person who creates the hurricane wind turbine.
To be honest that sounds like a pretty cool job. I wouldn't mind doing that and helping the environment at the same time
get in cunt
So it's fairly safe to say as someone who is required to think about the future you didn't vote for the backwards party?
Yeah but how much money to you make for Ridgy-Didge True Blue Battlers like Clivey and Gina that maybe one day will trickle-down to me you lefty scumbag? That's what I thought
There is a slight chance that I‚Äôm the bloke that maintains the grounds of the shed you guys are based out of...
Cheers cunt
cool story bro
A coworker used to do that. Pretty sure he's back as a project manager doing it again.
I really admire you with the opportunity to work in the renewable energy industry! I am currently looking for opportunities like that. Haha.
Brilliant work champion - this is what we need. Wind. Solar. Not a fucking energy target or another brain dead fucking tax
But coal jobs hurrr durr derp.
Very cool. I engineer SCADA systems for wind farms and utility-scale solar here in Texas and the surrounding areas. Good time to be in the business.
I live in between around 200 of those windmills and the latest whinge is that it fucks up the well water.
"It isn't enough to just be building more renewable power generators. No matter how you look at it, unless you overhaul the entire energy grid, just adding more and more generators will hardly help anything."
"Nuclear reactors are better, more efficient and more reliable."
But....but these things caused my dear Braeysohn to develop Wind Autism. How do you sleep at night?
You monster!
"How much wind can one generate, and how is the direction to blow the wind determined?"
3 megawatts -at rated wind (12 mts per sec)
There are a number of YouTube videos and other posts that show how the wind generators function. It‚Äôs best to do some research on the web and educate yourself against liars who misquote on Facebook!
How do they get up there for inspections and maintenance is there a lift inside the mast or you‚Äôve gotta climb?
Yup we do have inspections/services depending on the turbine operating hours and few machines have lifts :)
"There are lifts most of the way in the larger masts, but yes, the old metal ladders are the go! There‚Äôs a few videos on YouTube about it. Quite interesting if you take a look."
Hear there's going to be plenty of business in Warringah.
Is your company hiring? I‚Äôm in. Got mad project management skills.
What training do you need to get that job?
Got some Engineering skills on my back!
Yup sure and will always increase. And yeah Renewables will be the future power house.
Are you a site engineer?
How do you even get into doing this? Everything about this market seems interesting.
"Is there a limit to how many wind farms we can have? Is there a point where too many may be bad for the grid, or where they can start causing bad effects from being too common? Like, I really hope not, I have a (possibly autistic related) near obsessive love with the things, they're glorious."
Are you using Siemens Gamesa blades? I may have imported these for you :D
"I've stood under one of the humungous turbines in the farm next to the Tesla battery. i don't remember it making much noise at all. I was just blown away (excuse pun) by its scale, grace, relative lack of noise, and the awesome engineering that must go to put something like that together."
And they are getting more better and efficient to save our money and increase the business.
"I always wonder what the break even point is for renewable and green energy systems. If you consider the construction and transportation involved, most of which I suspect is done with nonrenewable systems how many years does it take to actually make a difference?"
"Very good work o7 I'm interested in what engineering degree you did - perhaps RE at UNSW? I'm doing a PV degree and will be entering the renewables industry very soon (but in solar, not wind of course)."
"Just for anyone reading this who did not decide to pursue a degree, there is plenty of work in wind turbines maintaining and installing the turbines. There's many aspects of it and different jobs but one is a blade repair tech. It involves getting certified on ropes and getting what's called a GWO. It's not difficult to pursue if you're relatively fit (decent, not an Olympic athlete) have good hands on skills and are not afraid of heights. Source: I work on ropes. EDIT: Be a little afraid of heights, not a Russian building dangler."
