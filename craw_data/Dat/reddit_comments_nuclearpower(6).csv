Is nuclear the answer to Australia's climate crisis?

comment
Yes
"Nuking Australia seems kinda... final, don't you think?"
"It's weir how Australia mines Uranium (the dirty, low-profit part of the nuclear economy) but won't use it to generate electricity (the clean, profitable part of the nuclear economy). Heck, Australia has done nuclear weapons testing, but still won't do nuclear power. Meanwhile they are one of the most carbon-intensive countries in the world."
We love coal more.
"The answer clearly is yes, but the politics say no. As an Australian electrical engineer, I am very much for nuclear energy, but it is not a few shared by the majority of Australians and Australian politicians. I also find it very uncomfortable to be in the same policy position as Peter Dutton...as I DO NOT SHARE HIS POLITICS, AND THE POLITICS OF THE ""LIBERAL PARTY""... In reality as the saying goes..."" Nothing is more powerful then an idea whose time has come"". For nuclear energy in Australia, the time has not come. I would hypothesise, that after 10 - 15 years, and that nuclear energy has proven that it has overcome the objections off... ""what about the waste?""...."" It is too expensive!""..."" It takes too long to construct!"".... new technologies such as micro-reactors [Westinghouse eVinci etc], and Small Modular Reactors have become nth of a Kind, and providing these prove their benefits, I do see Australia and Australians coming around to it. I do think the AUKUS nuclear submarine project is the Trojan Horse that will also help change the Australian Public's attitude to it..."
The conversation is deeply anti-nuclear publication tightly aligned with centre left in Australia They parot the same tired arguments against nuclear on economics grounds (ignoring south korea or China successful builds) while waving around what we now know is deeply flawed CSIRO report
"It's much worse than people think. The GenCost document HEAVILY cherry picked numbers. They picked large scale nuclear plants with worse case scenario and only presented best case for renewable energy. It gets worse though. They like to advertise it's a joint venture between CSIRO and AEMO. Except in section 1.2, 'roles', AEMO commissioned Aurecon to run the numbers for the current energy market. So a third party, who is a massive engineering firm with their own private agenda. Had the opportunity to heavily contribute to a document that politicians will use to make generational decisions. Aurecon currently currently deploys renewable energy projects. I wonder why the document was negative on an energy source they can't make money from... It's like asking a mining company to write a document about environmental damage due to mining. Then give it to a politician who doesn't understand mining and they parrot the ""facts""."
Simple answer CANDU 4 Aus. In ontario there is refurbishments going at 3 stations for the CANDU units. They have thus far been coming in on budget and time. Building on that experience there is discussion for another 4 at one location (Bruce Power) and rumbling of another 4 at an additional station (Darlington). And these are full size roughly 1000 MWe units each. A proven track record which also requires no enrichment plants so.
"I've always found the economic argument morally ambiguous.
If your child has cancer would you run for the cheapest option on the shelf?"
"No, no you don't understand, climate change is the biggest threat to humanity we've ever had, we have to be cheap, best to save that money for the inevitable wasteland wars."
"Its a question that we might only be able to answer if we reach the end of deploying solar, wind & other renewables with storage and still can't turn off coal and gas whilst running an electrified or synthesized fuel transport grid. I think its possible to do it with renewables & storage, but I can see various factors making it either impossible to do or impossible to do without spending a massive fortune on it. I've always advocated for keeping all of your options open for consideration if only so you can strong arm one corporation or another to say you'll walk if you don't get a better deal. But keeping the option of nuclear open is important if things like the solar supply chain grinds to a halt, an entirely international problem from Australia's perspective and a large sovereign risk of solar installations. But the biggest question mark is storage. Nothing has shown itself to be capable of scaling to storing the amounts of power we need to store for nighttime. A lot of theoretical options but few multi gigawatt hour installations so far."
"It would sure suck to get 80% of the way to decarbonizing the grid in 8 years, and then realize you needed some nukes and starting 10+ year process to build them. Instead of building a few now and being able to go fully carbon free in a dozen years or so when they come online. And on the storage front, the challenge isn't really night time - today's lithium ion tech can totally handle that. It's the weekly storage for wind and seasonal storage for... seasons... That will make decarbonizing with 100% renewables very hard."
"Nuclear can always be the answer to decarbonizing energy, but if there is anywhere that energy can be decarbonized without nuclear, it is Australia."
"This. Australia is well on its way towards phasing out coal already*. Smart money in Australia is currently investing in storage, not generation, as there is a good chance any new generation project won't make its money back. Nuclear probably made sense 50 years ago for Australia. But given it wasn't implemented then, its no longer makes make sense now. *However if immigration keeps up, this trend might reverse in the near future, and it will be worth revisiting nuclear as an option."
"If you believe that long-necked, small-headed young chap. Yes."
"It's better than fossil fuels and biomass. Australia could have started building nuclear power stations 16 years ago. Australia probably won't buy VVERs, but they might buy APR-1400s or Hualong Ones."
"I highly doubt they will buy a Hualong One given the current government. APR-1400s would a great choice given the project performance the Koreans have demonstrated, but even APR-1000s or EPR should be considered. (As a Canadian I also have to say that Candu would be a great fit for Australia, for mostly the same reasons it works so well in Canada. But I acknowledge that it seems unlikely Australia would choose a Candu design)"
No. Climate change is worldwide. Australia is a negligible contributor. It's also very sunny so solar seems like a good electricity option
I feel like so much Australia is empty but sunny. Maybe the open space and desert conditions create some winds. Australia is primed in leading the world in renewable energy and nuclear is maybe 3rd.
"Nuclear, is just the answer until we crack fusion. To everything."
"By contrast, Copenhagen Atomics are awaiting approval of their Molten Salt reactor. They already have two protypes running near Copenhagen, just without the fissile products. They proclaim themselves that costs will be below $20 per MWh. ""Copenhagen Atomics is developing a thorium based molten salt reactor with the same footprint as a 40 foot shipping container, which delivers 100 MW thermal energy per unit and is expected to reach an electricity price (LCoE) below $20/MWh in a mass manufacturing scenario."" https://www.copenhagenatomics.com/potential/"
LOL Nice PAPER reactor from a country without nuclear program .
No
Why would we let you stop china
Why would we want China's new land nuked you all stupid modern idiot Aussies you know nothing about history or geopolitical or absolutely anything as some bright spark said us might Danite warriors or Normans Vikings real blonde red haired blue eyed Arya Israelites run the place
Glowing rocks bad! FFS.
"Here's a question, is Australia geologically active, i.e. lots of earthquakes? That's the only reason (besides the political bullshittery) to perhaps be reluctant of nuclear power. And even then if you're smart about it, you can engineer around that problem. But no, keep going with the coal."
"Australia is, um, really big. There are a couple spots with tsunami and seismic risks, sure. But there are lots of spots that don't have that."
Baizuo are lost people .
"It is A answer, but to take on climate change many things need to be done. Nuclear can't solve it on its own, but it can help tremendously"
The good news for us is that eventually every country will have to embrace the Gen 4 designs and hopefully not build them stupidly or run them stupidly etc. We don't have any other choice.
or research more and find that China is the only real danger but we all have too many businesses in bed with them to complain.
Then continue to do research and realize that China is also rolling out more renewable energy than anyone else by a large margin. China alone is adding about 1/2 the global wind power for instance. In 2021 China added more offshore wind power than the rest of world added in the previous 5 years combined. China may be the only major nation that is actually treating COVID he climate crisis as a crisis.
"Yes, nuclear is much better for the environment. It takes much less space than wind and solar, uses less raw materials and produce orders of magnitude less waste. Nuclear has no pollution contrary to dirty biomass and wind power plants who emit micro plastics, hormone disturbers such as bisphenol A and forever chemicals like PFAS - this happens due to egde erosion of the blades."
"The uranium needs to be processed prior to being suitable for a reactor. The ""nuclear fuel cycle Overview"" article on the ""world nuclear association"" states: “Anything from 20,000 to 400,000 tonnes of uranium ore” for every 24 tonnes of uranium fuel with can produce 1 TWh of electrical energy. The world nuclear association also state on there article ""Mineral Requirements for Electricity Generation"" that offshore wind farm needs 200 tonnes/TWh. Note: This analysis ignores ALL consumed critical materials in the ‘raw state’ for building any of the listed generators."
Solar and nuclear energies should solve all their issues.
"It’s the answer to everyone’s climate crisis, but alas."
"""Australia's"" 🤪"
Yes
Geothermal
Yes
Yes.
Nuclear has advanced a lot. It makes more than enough power and less pollution. Nuclear is what we should be pushing and advancing. Green energy is just not advanced enough to replace fossil fuels or nuclear. And until China reduces their emissions and follow the rules. Nothing the rest of the world does will make a significant change.
"Nuclear has advanced a lot. It makes more than enough power and less pollution. Nuclear is what we should be pushing and advancing. Green energy is just not advanced enough to replace fossil fuels or nuclear. There have been more advances in renewable energy then nuclear over the last couple of decades with nuclear energy still relying on the boiling water concept. Renewables on the other hand have made massive advances in the world of fast acting power electronics, fast grid response and support technologies. Nuclear power can't be scaled down for microgeneration making it hard to prototype unlike renewable energy research. Nuclear also looses efficiency at smaller scales which makes SMRs less economical then conventional reactors. The nuclear battery that everyone is talking about lately uses photovoltaic cells to convert the beta decay to electricity."
Australia almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
"Yes yes yes if only our government would stop procrastinating, it is the best option to replace our ageing coal plants 🇭🇲👌"
Nuclear is the answer to everyone's crisis. Until they figure out fusion.
Yes
