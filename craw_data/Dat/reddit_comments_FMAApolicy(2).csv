"Laborís flagship Future Made in Australia bill faces a parliamentary impasse with the Coalition opposing the legislation and the Greens withholding their support, placing the framework for the spending of billions of taxpayers dollars in jeopardy"

comment
"Greens leader Adam Bandt made clear the minor party was refusing to back the legislation for different reasons. He said it could cement a future for coal and gas past 2050 and create a new mining boom without ensuring a proper return to the public. ‚ÄúWe think there‚Äôs a real risk that the government does with critical minerals what it did with gas and just opens it all up to the highest bidder, potentially with taxpayer funds, and you end up with Australia in 10, 20 years‚Äô time not having enough of these minerals for ourselves,‚Äù he said. Greens are asking for a public stake in the projects and protections from domestic mineral shortfalls.https://thenightly.com.au/politics/greens-leader-adam-bandt-says-taxpayers-should-get-a-stake-in-projects-backed-under-future-made-in-australia-c-14798428"
I don't think anyone in this sub cares. They'll just be upset that the greens don't side with Labor.
"Oh look at that, Greens and the Liberals working together to sink good legislation. Again.  Bandt needs to read Superpower by Ross Garnaut. Green manufacturing is the economic opportunity of a generation for Australia. "
A few billion is a drop in the ocean compared to the megalith that China is with this tech - how on earth are we supposed to compete? This will be a slush fund just like so many of their other initiatives.
fkn greens once again.. I stg
"It's funny how Taylor mentions they want a more flexible workforce, but the NSW state government are forcing their public workers back to the office."
They aren't doing that though?
I sense another video wailing on the Greens coming up.
The greens think that will gain more seats by backing the lnp. What planet are they on?
