      "               Charles Edel: Good afternoon to our audience who is tuning in online to watch this, as well to those who are here today at CSIS. I’m Charles Edel, the Australia Chair and senior advisor here at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Australia Chair, which was generously endowed by Pratt Industries, is dedicated to increasing mutual understanding between the United States and Australia and serving as an independent platform to pursue policies that help advance, deepen, and broaden the bilateral alliance.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               Today we were lucky enough to host here at CSIS our first American Australian Indo-Pacific Strategic Dialogue. The conference brought together key stakeholders, decisionmakers, and strategic thinkers from both countries as we pursued ideas to advance both how Washington and Canberra can work together to facilitate a more prosperous and more secure future for both of us. I want to sincerely thank all of our conference participants for participating, many of whom are in the room with us. And your thoughtful comments really helped us in thinking about what are the future moves that we need to pursue together.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               Now I’m very excited to say that concluding this conference it’s my great pleasure to welcome the honorable Christopher Bowen, who is making his first trip to the United States in his new role as minister for climate change and energy. Minister Bowen is here, having just flown in from Pittsburgh, where he participated on the Global Clean Energy Action Forum. The timing for today’s conversation on securing a clean and secure energy future for the Indo-Pacific is auspicious, as both Australia and the United States have recently passed major climate legislation.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               But if the timing is auspicious, it’s also critical given what’s at stake for both of our countries, for the region and, indeed, for our entire planet. To that end, Australia’s new government is moving climate policy to center stage in both how it approaches its domestic and its foreign policies. We’re delighted to host Mr. Bowen here at CSIS today, who will lay out how the new Australian government plans on doing just that.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               The Honorable Chris Bowen is, as I said, minister for climate change and energy. He is also the federal member for McMahon and New South Wales. Mr. Bowen grew up in Smithfield in western Sydney, and after serving as mayor of Fairfield, entered the federal parliament in 2004. He’s held a wide range of portfolios, including serving as treasurer, minister for human services, minister for immigration, and minister for small businesses.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               He lives in Smithfield, excuse me, with his wife Rebecca, with his children Grace and Max and, of course, last but not least, with your Labradors, Ollie and Toby. It’s a great honor to have him here with us today. And I’d like to invite him to discuss opportunities for a U.S.-Australian collaboration to deliver a clean and secure energy future for the Indo-Pacific region. Minister Bowen. (Applause.)\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               Minister Christopher Bowen: Well, thank you, Charles, for that welcome. And thank you for the honor of addressing a body as distinguished as the CSIS this afternoon.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               Of course, in Australia we had developed in recent years the practice of recognizing and honoring the traditional owners of the lands on which we gather, as an act of inclusion and respect. I live in Western Sydney, as Charles said, which is the land of the Gandangara people, the Darug nation. And I pay my respects to them, and pay my respects to all indigenous Australian people, wherever they are. And of course, pay my respects, in that vein, to the Piscataway and the Nacotchtank people, the first nations people, traditional owners of Washington, D.C.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               I also want to acknowledge you, Charles, and the creation of your important role as Australia Chair and acknowledge Anthony Pratt’s generosity. And of course, acknowledge the ambassador, Arthur Sinodinos, here today. The appointment of the chair is, I think, a very important and positive step, recognizing the importance of the Indo-Pacific, of course, and the importance of the relationship between the United States and Australia within the Indo-Pacific. And I’m sure Charles will give you plenty of content to work with over the next few years.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               Well, today’s function is the last of my trip to the United States, which began with the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and included, as Charles said, the productive clean energy ministerial in Pittsburgh. And there has been a real sense of productive urgency in the air this week in all the forums I’ve been involved in, as indeed they should be. It’s that urgency that I want to focus my remarks on today. The urgent need to reduce emissions this decade, and the urgent need to secure our supply chains as we do so. This is in keeping with your theme today of your conference, a clean and secure energy future in the Indo-Pacific.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               We have less than a decade to ensure we keep the world as close as possible to 1.5 degrees of warming. Every one-tenth of one degree above 1.5 degrees has serious implications for our health and the health of our planet. And of course, has serious implications for the security of our region as well. Whether we look at the world’s largest archipelago in Indonesia or the impact on our Pacific Island family, there are real implications for every small degree of warming over 1.5 degrees.\n",
      "              </p>\n",
      "              <p>\n",
      "               And of course, the other element of urgency is supply chains. When I think about the possible impediments to achieving Australia’s ambition to reduce emissions by 43 percent and move our electricity grid to 82 percent renewables by 2030, there are two things which spring to mind: Labor shortages and supply chain constraints. And cooperation between likeminded countries on supply chains will be key to achieving our respective ambitions.

Today more than 80 percent of our solar PV production is concentrated in one country. This is expected to reach over 95 percent in a very short time frame. I reckon that meets any definition of a monopoly, and in the context of a global energy system that needs to decarbonize, the potential risk to energy security the world over is significant. It’s a similar story with lithium batteries, with electrolyzers used to produce hydrogen, and the list goes on. The simple truth is that no one country can produce enough clean energy imports to meet global need. Even if we were comfortable with the level of concentration in the supply chain, the stark fact is that current production won’t be enough to meet future demands on the path to net zero. To achieve net zero we all need to be producing the components to get us there, more reliable supply chains, and more supply chains in total.\n",

Firstly: reliability. It’s in America’s best interest for Australia to be developing renewable manufacturing capacity, and vice versa, because we represent a reliable and secure supply chain for each other. Our minerals will be essential but I want to be very clear: Australia must be more than a quarry. We need to add value, make things, and expand our place in global value chains. Secondly, these must be ethical supply chains. Moving to renewable economy is a moral imperative, as well as an economic opportunity, but we have to ensure that this transition itself is conducted in as ethical way as possible. It’s much easier to assert and verify, for example, that there’s no child labor or unethical labor practices used in the value add of Australian lithium or cobalt than it would be other potential sources from around the world. The rapid scale-up of production required should not be used to mask unethical labor practices, and this is a shared responsibility for all of us.\n",

      "               Now, while this task is enormous, of course, so are the opportunities. I’m fond of saying that the world’s climate emergency is Australia’s jobs opportunity, because I know that while concepts like GDP and billions of dollars invested are important, what really makes a difference to ordinary people’s lives is their standard of living, and particularly good, well-paying, secure jobs. Addressing climate change is not only an opportunity for more jobs, it represents an obligation to ensure that those jobs pay decent wages, have good conditions, and deliver better lives for ordinary workers. The best way to counter the naysayers who still call for delay and denial is to demonstrate that working people stand to benefit from action. That’s why our government takes the view that the economy needs to work for people and not the other way around. And that’s true of the transformation of our economies to address climate change as much as it is for any other area.\n",

In July Secretary Granholm and I signed the Australia-U.S. Net-Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership. The partnership will accelerate the development and deployment of zero-emissions technology, including long-duration energy storage, digital electricity grids, and technology to integrate variable renewable energy, hydrogen, and direct air capture. And just this week, Secretary Granholm and I have met to map out the current situation and the future steps to implement that very important partnership. The partnership is a commitment to make climate change a centerpiece of our alliance with the U.S., as Prime Minister Albanese suggested in the days after his election. But it also recognizes the need to work together to overcome the immediate energy security and supply chain challenges, and build resiliency into the future. This week I also signed a letter of intent on the Clean Energy Demand Initiative, with John Kerry in Pittsburgh, in recognition that the public and private sectors must work together to achieve shared climate- and energy-related goals. The Clean Energy Demand Initiative to increase transparency for investors and link companies with countries, sending a message that Australia’s open for business and a reliable investment partner. And I’m very pleased that Apple, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Google, and Amazon are some of the U.S. companies that have expressed interest in investing in Australia’s clean energy-generation infrastructure, and it’s estimated they could invest up to $2.9 billion to increase renewable deployment.\n",

Those have powered industry and transport in Australia and other states for decades.

In our case, ours is the framework. It’s not the big investment that’s in the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s setting a framework. Really, our legislation is about the message is sends to the private sector rather than what it does for government. Although, there are things for government in it.\n",

That’s important, because it sends the message that those are the targets which are here to stay. The prime minister and I had already notified the UNFCCC of the new targets, but we’ve now enshrined them in law. That’s really important. Everywhere I go, every business tells me: We want certainty. And we provided that certainty by changing the law. And it's hard to legislate, but it’s even harder to repeal, in both countries I think it’s fair to say.\n",

Governments will make – Cabinets will make decisions on future targets but will be advised by the Climate Change Authority. And if the Climate Change Authority gives me as the minister of the day or future ministers’ advice which we don’t accept, we have to explain why. That’s a really transparent process. I and future ministers have to report annually to parliament on progress in achieving the targets. So it’s really about that framework and that message it sends. We’re open for business. We got one set of policies. We got one change. We had too much chopping and changing of energy policies. Now we have one framework.\n",

So there we have Rewire the Nation, which is our policy to build 10,000 kilometers of transmission wires across our country, because renewable energy is spread across the country unlike coal and gas which tend to be clustered in geographic locations. Renewable energy is everywhere, which means you do need to upgrade the grid. It’s a massive task, and opportunity. Safeguards Mechanism, which is our mechanism to reduce safeguard emissions from our 215 biggest emitters. And a whole bunch of others – community batteries, electric vehicle strategy, a whole bunch of others. But they’re the policies that we’ve already laid out and are getting on with.\n",

But traditionally Australia has fueled its economic growth based on mining, based on energy sectors. And we’re talking about, as you characterize it, a fairly radical transition to a new source or sources of energy. And as we grapple with this challenge ourselves as well, I’m hoping you can talk a little bit about steps that the government is thinking about to mitigate and cushion that transition for workers themselves.\n",

We need to do that. They’re in different places. It’s the transition that you referred to. I guess a couple of things, Charles. Firstly, our policy has created a lot of jobs. And they create them in the regions. Five out of six of those 604,000 jobs I referred to are in the regions. And by and large, they’re in the regions which are energy regions. Because the regions that have powered Australia for so long will continue to power us because they have a number of advantages.\n",

They have the grid. That’s where the grid is strongest, although we got to upgrade the grid. Where the grid is strongest, where there’s the most transmission infrastructure is the areas where there had been coal and gas plants, because the infrastructure had been built to transfer the energy. So that makes sense to put more renewable energy there. That creates jobs.\n",

Even if you’re a traditional energy work in a coal and gas-fired power station, those skills are quite necessary. Of course, with some additions and some training, et cetera, in the news jobs. It’s a myth that there’s no jobs in renewable energy. There are, a lot. They’re not all at the source, where the energy is created. They come in the management, in the storage, in the transmission – hence, the 604,000 jobs.\n",

Then in addition, you know, there can be infrastructure around – you know, architectural infrastructure in terms of government design around assisting those communities.

In fact, the minister for resources in northern Australia, Madeleine King, just said: Australia has the potential to become a major global supplier of critical minerals and rare earths, which will be essential to help Australia and the world transition to low-emissions technology and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Can you talk a little bit about the development plan of critical minerals, how this is going to be pursued and extracted in a climate-friendly way?\n",

The government isn’t going to do this, but we will provide – what we’re doing is providing a certain policy framework and stability for it to do so. And we’ll – we will work very closely with any minerals – you know, critical-minerals and rare-earths company wanting to develop more in Australia, and we will ensure a smoother passage with all the necessary, you know, environmental protections and safeguards in place. We would seek to smooth the passage as much as possible.\n",

      "               And as I said before, also I think the economy changes. I think the economy of a rare-earths and critical-minerals development phase means that it encourages extraction and encourages more value adding in Australia, which in turn encourages more extraction.

When is the right time? And that link has been drawn. And it is correct to say every natural disaster – you know, with the exception, I guess, of earthquakes and volcanoes – but every other natural disaster is going to occur more often and be more intense due to climate change – whether it be floods, which has equally impacted on Australia recently, and we’re seeing around the world, or drought, or bushfires/wildfires.\n",

I think the key in the change in Australia has been change, frankly, that the now government conducted in the lead-up to the election to change the climate-change debate from a moral one to an economic one. We ran the case to the Australian people that, sure, climate change is a moral imperative. Action on climate change is a moral imperative for future generations and internationally to our partners and friends around the world. But even if it wasn’t, it’s good economic policy. Even if no other country was acting on climate change, we should because it creates jobs.\n",

Australia is only 1 percent of emissions, so we shouldn’t worry. I mean, that argument worked for the best part of 20 years. What we did is model our policies, come up with the policies, have them independently modeled. Everywhere we went, we talked about 604,000 jobs created, five out of six in the – in the regions, the more than $70 billion worth of private investment credit, the fact that renewable energy’s the cheapest form of energy so it puts downward pressure on power prices. All that was all we talked about. And that was the most effective foil to the argument that action on climate change might be OK, but not if it costs you your job or your children their job or your community’s economic future. That was the change. Sure, accompanied with the terrible impact of the bushfires and the floods, but I think that could have occurred and we still wouldn’t have had a proper discussion about climate change if we weren’t making the economic case.\n",

What actions can Australia take, should Australia be taking along with the United States, to convince the Pacific Island community, who consistently says that their number-one fear – probably their number-one, -two, and -three fears – are the existential effects of climate change on their habitations?

You know, there’s Pacific leaders that I’m spending a fair bit of time with, including in the city energy forum in July, you know, inviting the energy minister of Samoa, for example, and putting him on the top table with, you know, Jennifer Granholm and the Indian minister and the Japanese minister, et cetera.

That’s what we need to do. And that doesn’t require a government decision to come in and say: You know, we are not going to export this coal, because 80 percent of our trading partners are committed to net zero. So the important thing is to be honest with communities, as I’ve done from – literally from my first day, when I was shadow minister for climate change and went on “The 7:30 Report” that night, on my first day on the portfolio, and said: We have to be honest with communities, coal communities.

There will be no new coal fired power stations built in Australia. As coal fired power stations close, as they inevitably will, they will not be replaced with new ones. That’s our position. It’s not the position of the Australian government. We got to be honest about that. And those coal fired power stations will continue to close. And they’re closing at an increasingly rapid rate. That’s just a statement of empirical fact. And so, again we got to prepare Australia for the alternative energy. Otherwise, we’re going to have an energy supply crunch. We got to prepare the workers for new jobs, which we’re doing, and create those new jobs. So it’s about managing that change.\n",

There are those in the opposition who say, well, we should be building new coal-fired power stations and we should be, you know, encouraging coal exports.

But in actuality, two of the biggest problems in the region happen to be – (background noise) – I thought I turned this off, but I didn’t. Two of the biggest problems in the region happen to be workforce engagement and the fact that labor remittances take up about 33 percent of the GNP of Pacific Island countries; also the fact that dependence on fossil fuels takes up about 50 percent of their GDPs. And so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about workforce plans. You already have mechanisms in place to attract Pacific Islanders, but it’s not just the Pacific Islanders. Just looking to your north, you have Indonesia, which is under severe climate change stress. We know that Jakarta’s sinking. So migration’s going to play an important part of the climate change scenario in the region. So really what I’m trying to get to is, as Australia’s economy grows, becomes much more efficient but it still has engagement in the region, particularly with Pacific Island countries, and to the north relations with Indonesia.

And migration played a big part, and clean energy jobs played an equally big part in those discussions, and we’ve said things about immigration both permanent and made announcements about permanent immigration which is obviously across the board and an appropriate place for temporary programs, and that engagement will continue. I do note that we’ve had programs – particularly you refer to Indonesia, a country very dear to my heart. We’ve had programs with Indonesia which have often been undersubscribed for the ability of Indonesians to come and work in Australia on a limited basis. Often we’ve had, you know, we’ve agreed with the Indonesian government X spots will be available, and I remember when I was immigration minister I would check and say, how’s that Indonesian program going and they’d say, Minister, it’s massively undersubscribed. Now, we can all sort of discuss what the reasons for that might be and how that might be dealt with, but it’s not just a matter of negotiating agreements and saying let’s get X spots here for Indonesia or Malaysia or anyone. No point in doing that if people aren’t actually coming in and taking up the opportunities. I think that’s an ongoing conversation.\n",

And I witnessed Fatih Birol and my friend Arifin Tasrif, as it relates to the IAEA reporting to emissions reduction in Indonesia.

We want to see them succeed. But I don’t think it’s a matter of saying, oh, well, we won’t spend this money on emissions reductions in Australia. Again, most of the money that’ll be spent on emissions reduction in Australia is private sector investment. We’ll provide the framework for it. And some government expenditure is, of course, necessary: IRENA, CEFC, Palisades Renewable Energy Fund. We’ve got to – but that’s not going to do the job. It’s unleashing those billions of dollars of private sector investment, and you know, that can be unleashed in Australia, in Indonesia, in anywhere, and everywhere. It has to be.\n",
