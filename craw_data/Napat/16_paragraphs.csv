"Japan is a world leader in the photovoltaic (PV) market, with a significant share of the global market since about 45% of photovoltaic cells are manufactured in Japan. The country has been at the forefront of solar energy innovation and has been investing heavily in the development of solar PV technology. The Japanese solar energy market is expected to witness more than a 9.2% CAGR during the forecast period (2023-2028). Factors such as solar PV projects under construction in the pipeline and planning stages are expected to boost the cumulative installed solar energy capacity during the forecast period. Let's dive deeper into trends, projects, and strategies with which Japan is leading the . Recent Trends in Japan's solar PV industry Japan's photovoltaic industry has been growing steadily over the years, and there have been several recent developments in the industry. Here are some of the recent developments in Japan's solar PV industry: Japan's photovoltaic market has been growing steadily over the years, with the country's share of the global photovoltaic market increasing. Japan is a leader in solar PV innovation and is now looking to grow its industry further amid US-China tensions and a shift to renewables. The country has been investing in floating solar power, which involves installing solar panels on water bodies such as reservoirs and lakes. Japan is the world leader in floating solar power, with over 60% of the world's floating solar capacity. Japan's Solar PV Industry is Set for Fresh Growth: Japan is a leader in solar PV innovation and is now looking to grow its industry further amid US-China tensions and a shift to renewables. The Japanese solar industry will need to bolster its manufacturing capacity to compete with other countries in the global solar supply chain. Key PV Industry Developments in Japan 2022: Japan is estimated to have had a 6.5 GW solar market in 2022, supported by the Ministry of the Environment's (MoE) feed-in tariff (FIT) and feed-in premium (FIP) programs, which expired at the start. Solar is expected to supply 14% to 16% of Japan's energy mix in fiscal year 2030, with a target PV generation capacity of 117.6 GW (AC). Japan's Future Plans in Photovoltaics Space-Based Solar Power and Perovskite Solar Cells: Japan is making progress in solar, offshore wind, storage, and hydrogen technology. The country is a leader in solar PV innovation and is now looking to grow its industry further amid US-China tensions and a shift to renewables. Japan Targets Adoption of Flexible Solar Panels by 2030: Japan aims to popularize the use of flexible solar cells by 2030, with the government planning to support mass production by domestic companies and introduce them at public buildings, train stations, schools, and elsewhere. Japan's photovoltaic market is one of the largest in the world, with a cumulative installed capacity of over 70 GW as of 2023. The country has been investing heavily in solar PV technology, with the government providing incentives for the installation of solar panels. The government's feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme has been instrumental in driving the growth of the solar PV market in Japan. The FIT scheme provides a guaranteed price for solar energy generated by residential and commercial PV systems, making it an attractive investment for homeowners and businesses. The plan clarifies the government's policy of working with companies and others to build supply networks and encourage widespread use of the panels. Japan is also investing in other innovative solar PV technologies, such as space-based solar power and flexible perovskite solar cells. Major Photovoltaic Projects in Japan Setouchi Kirei Mega Solar Power Plant - located in Setouchi, Okayama, is the largest solar power station in Japan, with a generating capacity of 235 MW. Mito Newtown Mega Solar Park - located in Ibaraki, has a capacity of 39.21 MW. Kamogawa Mirai Solar Power Plant - located in Chiba, has a capacity of 31.211 MW.
