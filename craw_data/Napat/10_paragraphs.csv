"Jonathan Kemp, Madeleine McCowage and Faye
								Wang"
"China, Japan and South Korea have all set targets to achieve net-zero carbon emissions
								by around the middle of this century. These three countries account for around
								two-thirds of Australia's fossil fuel exports. Based on emission scenarios
								consistent with these commitments, we find that Australia's coal exports
								could decline significantly by 2050, with a more modest effect likely for
								liquefied natural gas exports; both may be offset to some degree by increases
								in green energy exports. The effect on overall Australian GDP is expected
								to be relatively small and gradual. Significant uncertainty surrounds the
								speed and manner in which countries will work to achieve net-zero emissions,
								as well as the technological developments that could change the efficiency
								and carbon intensity of fossil fuels."
"Global carbon emissions have risen sharply over the past 150 years. The
							major driver of this increase has been the rise in global energy use. Over
							the past 50 years, the world's energy supply has more than doubled,
							and in recent years the share generated by fossil fuels – the major
							source of carbon emissions – has accounted for around 80 per cent
							(Graph 1)."
"As parties to the Paris Agreement on climate change, the governments of China,
							Japan and South Korea have each announced targets to substantially reduce
							carbon emissions over the coming decades. These economies are Australia's
							top three goods export partners, and are destinations for around two-thirds
							of Australia's fossil fuel exports. As a result, their efforts to reduce
							carbon emissions will be a significant determining factor in the outlook for
							Australia's exports."
"China, Japan and South Korea are jointly responsible for around a quarter of
							global fossil fuel consumption. Fossil fuels (including oil, coal and natural
							gas) dominate these countries' energy mix, providing more than 85 per cent
							of energy supplied in these countries in 2018, far higher than in the remainder
							of the world (Graph 2). China is the most significant emitter of carbon
							of the three countries, due to its large population and energy mix. Coal accounted
							for around 60 per cent of China's energy use in 2018, far greater
							than in Japan and South Korea (where oil is the main fossil fuel) and the
							rest of the world (where the main fossil fuel is natural gas). China is a
							heavy user of coal given the country's abundant coal reserves, while Japan
							and Korea, with minimal domestic energy reserves, have relied more on oil.
							In general, coal use produces substantially more carbon emissions than either
							oil or natural gas for the energy it generates. This means that China's
							energy mix in particular is highly carbon intensive; the ratio of carbon dioxide
							emitted to energy supplied in China was around a quarter higher than the global
							average in 2018 (International Energy Agency 2021a)."
"China is also the world's largest energy-consuming country, responsible
							for around one-fifth of the world's total consumption (International Energy
							Agency 2021b). This is primarily a function of China's population, which
							is also the world's largest. Adjusted for population size, China's
							per capita energy use is broadly comparable to that of other east Asian economies,
							including South Korea, when they were at a similar level of GDP per capita
							(Graph 3)."
"Japan and South Korea have committed to achieving net-zero emissions of greenhouse
							gases by 2050, while China has committed to net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide
							by 2060. Carbon dioxide is by far the most significant greenhouse gas emitted
							by all three countries. In the interim, Japan and South Korea are targeting
							46 per cent and 24 per cent reductions in greenhouse gas
							emissions from recent levels (2013 and 2017, respectively) by 2030 (Tsukimori
							2022; Republic of Korea
							2020). China is similarly targeting a peak in carbon emissions by 2030 and a 65 per cent
							drop in the carbon intensity of output from 2005 levels at that
							time. These targets
								are summarised in Graph 4. Emissions have been rising more quickly in
								China than in Japan or South Korea in recent years, and the planned peak
								in emissions is much later. The absolute decline in emissions required to
								achieve net-zero emissions is highest for China, but on a per capita basis
								it is roughly similar across the three countries (Graph 5)."
"These emissions targets have been set with reference to broader global initiatives.
							Countries may put forward other or strengthened targets at the 26th UN Climate
							Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in October and November 2021. Under
							the Paris Agreement, parties are required to submit updated plans (‘nationally
							determined contributions’ or NDCs) at least every five years (United
							Nations 2015)."
"A range of policies have been announced by China, Japan and South Korea to
							achieve these objectives, although full details are not yet available. In
							the near term, governments see reducing the use of fossil fuels in their energy
							mixes as key; reducing emissions from the rest of the economy will follow.
							Emerging technologies and innovations will also play an important role."
"China, Japan and South Korea have pledged to undertake a range of measures
							to assist in the shift from carbon-intensive energy use, including: investing
							in and further developing renewable sources; ensuring a pipeline of clean
							energy projects; and establishing a higher renewables share of energy supply.
							China is seeking to raise the non-fossil fuel share of primary energy consumption
							(including renewables and nuclear) to around 25 per cent by 2030
							(Xinhua 2020b). Japan is looking to roughly double the renewables share of
							its electricity power generation to per cent by 2030, while South Korea is seeking
							a six-fold increase to 42 per cent by 2034 (Kim 2020; Yamaguchi
							2021). China and Japan's plans include a greater role for nuclear power,
							while South Korea is seeking to phase it out altogether (Kumagai and Yep 2021;
							MIT Energy Initiative 2018)."
"All three countries are seeking to reduce the use of coal through a combination
							of phasing out and decommissioning coal-fired power generation plants, improving
							plant efficiency and restricting capacity
							growth. China and South Korea have also
							sought to put a price on carbon emissions through national emissions trading
							schemes (ETS), with China's now the largest in the
							world."
"The role of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the transition to net-zero emissions
							is more mixed. LNG can be used as a cleaner near-term alternative to coal
							and a ‘bridge fuel’ until renewables are scaled up. However, while
							it produces lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal at the point of use,
							it still generates large methane emissions when it is produced – a greenhouse
							gas that is more potent than carbon dioxide. China has increasingly used LNG
							as a cleaner alternative to coal power generation and has targets to increase
							domestic gas production. In contrast, Japan recently announced that it is
							seeking to almost halve LNG's share of its energy mix by 2030. South Korea
							is currently deciding between three potential policy roadmaps to achieve net
							zero, which see varying roles for LNG."
"While these three countries appear committed to switching to other energy sources
							from fossil fuels, there may be challenging trade-offs to navigate. China
							is the world's largest renewable energy producer and has made significant
							domestic and foreign investments in renewable energy in the past decade (Global
							Commission on the Geopolitics of Energy Transformation 2019); however, in
							2020 construction permits for new coal projects increased, and China's
							ETS does not impose an absolute limit on emissions. Japan and South Korea
							have also made significant progress expanding the renewables share of energy,
							but high population density, scarce land, the high costs of building and running
							renewable projects, and difficult terrain make it comparatively difficult
							to progress further (Graph 6). Accordingly, these two countries are seeking
							to build wind farms
							offshore. Whether China and Japan will be able to scale-up nuclear energy to help offset declining
							fossil fuel use, as they are seeking to do, is unclear; for instance, much
							of Japan's nuclear fleet remains offline after the Fukushima disaster
							(Graph 6). Whether South Korea can sufficiently scale-up renewables to
							offset the role of nuclear in its energy system also remains to be seen."
"Green hydrogen, as well as carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) and carbon
							dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, have the potential to play an important
							role in economy-wide
							decarbonisation. Japan, China and South Korea are ambitious in their efforts to develop these
							technologies through combinations of regulatory and R&D support and subsidies.
							However, they still require large-scale investment and face numerous technical
							challenges before they can be deployed at scale and be commercially viable."
"The three countries have also pointed to a range of other policies to work
							towards net-zero emissions, including electrification and efficiency-enhancing
							measures in transport, buildings and
							appliances. Efforts to make industry less emissions intensive will also take place, although
							these are expected to be challenging in the near
							term. Most notably, China, Japan and
							South Korea are all seeking to reduce emissions that arise from using coking
							coal in steelmaking. Chinese authorities are encouraging a shift in steel
							production towards low-carbon methods, and are targeting a 20 per cent
							reduction in steel sector emissions by 2025. Several Japanese and South Korean
							steelmakers have also pledged to substantially cut emissions by 2050, and
							are investigating ways to produce ‘green steel’ using hydrogen."
"Fossil fuels account for around a quarter of Australia's total exports,
							of which around two-thirds is exported to Japan, China and South Korea (Graph 7).
							By value, Australia's fossil fuel exports mainly comprise thermal coal
							(4 per cent of total exports), coking coal (7 per cent)
							and LNG
							(10 per cent). Oil accounts for a relatively
							small share of total exports, at just 2 per cent. Coking and thermal
							coal are estimated to account for around 80 per cent of carbon dioxide
							emissions made by Australia's fossil fuel exports, while LNG accounts
							for most of the remainder (Graph 8)."
"The impact of net-zero emission targets in China, Japan and South Korea on
							Australia's fossil fuel exports is uncertain. The policies to achieve
							them are yet to be fully articulated, and technological advancements and carbon
							abatement costs are unclear. However, scenario analysis is one way of understanding
							how emission reduction policies might affect Australia's economy."
"Several international bodies have explored how the global and regional energy
							mix might evolve under various policies aimed at achieving net-zero emissions
							by 2050. We focus here on climate scenarios designed by the Network for Greening
							the Financial System (NFGS), a consortium of central banks dedicated to improving
							climate risk management (NGFS
							2021). These scenarios were designed
							to provide a foundation and common reference point for analysis of climate
							change and its economic impacts, allowing for consistency and comparability
							of results across institutions around the globe."
"Importantly, the NGFS provides country-level energy demand profiles by fuel
							type, which outlines possible energy transition paths for China, Japan, South
							Korea and the rest of the world under different climate scenarios. Overall,
							the NGFS outlines the following transition paths required for countries to
							achieve net zero: an increasing role for renewable energy generation; a secular
							decline in the share of coal in energy production; and an eventual decline
							in the share of gas (Graph 9). These are in line with current plans signalled
							by China, Japan and South Korea. That said, there are many paths to net-zero
							emissions, and transition scenarios will depend crucially on the assumptions
							underpinning them."
"Each NGFS scenario includes different assumptions about the availability of
							technologies and government policies. These can be summarised by the future
							paths for carbon emissions and carbon prices; carbon prices are used as a
							proxy for overall government policy intensity, but governments could use other
							tools. These assumptions are mapped to the consequences for the climate, such
							as mean temperature changes, using scientific models. Key scenarios include:"
"We use the NGFS country-level energy demand profiles under the various scenarios
							to estimate the effect of these developments on Australia's exports and
							provide some information on the contributions of China, Japan and South Korea.
							To do this, we assume that Australia's share of fossil fuel energy consumption
							in each country is
							unchanged. This may overstate the impact
							because Australian fuel tends to be higher quality (and therefore produces
							fewer emissions per unit of energy) and is produced at lower cost than many
							competing
							producers."
"Under the baseline, coal exports increase gradually to be 17 per cent
							higher in 2050. By contrast, the volume of Australian coal exports falls under
							all other scenarios, with the sharpest falls seen under the Net Zero and Below
							2°C scenarios (Graph 10). Coal exports under these scenarios fall by
							80 per cent by mid-century, with declining demand from China, Japan
							and South Korea accounting for around two-thirds of the fall. Coal exports
							under NDC remain little changed over the current decade, before falling rapidly
							over the 2030s to reach 65 per cent of 2020 levels in 2050; falling
							demand from China, Japan and South Korea (while less sharp than implied by
							the Net Zero scenario) contribute over 90 per cent of the decline."
"The NDC scenario suggests countries are unlikely to materially alter their
							energy mix in the near term, and that demand for coal will likely remain robust
							this decade. However, as global appetite for coal tapers off from 2030 onwards
							under all scenarios except for the baseline, Australian coal-related investments
							are at risk of becoming ‘stranded assets’ as lower export volumes
							and prices weigh on firm profitability. The risk is somewhat lower for Australian
							coking coal producers because of their lower cost of supply relative to other
							producers and strong global demand for high-quality coking coal in steelmaking
							until greener alternatives become more widespread. Nevertheless, current coal
							reserves at operating Australian mines notably exceed projected export demand
							to 2050 under the Net Zero and Below 2°C scenarios; this suggests there is
							potential for ‘stranding’ even if there is no investment into
							new
							mines."
"The outlook for LNG exports is more resilient to a range of scenarios, as developing
							countries in particular substitute from coal to gas to reduce emissions, cushioning
							the fall in demand from advanced economies switching to renewable energy.
							Under the baseline and NDC scenarios, LNG exports increase by around 80 per cent
							and 60 per cent from 2020 levels
							(Graph 11). By contrast, LNG exports are projected to fall to around half of their current
							levels by mid-century under Net Zero, led by sharp declines in Japanese and
							South Korean demand (which account for almost 40 percentage points of
							the fall). LNG exports under Below 2°C also increase in the near to medium
							term, reflecting the interim global transition from coal to gas, but decline
							from 2040 onwards to be around 2020 levels by 2050."
"With the global momentum towards reducing carbon emissions, Australia is well-placed
							to participate in the nascent renewable energy export market. NGFS expects
							global demand for renewables to become the largest source of energy by 2050
							under the Net Zero and Below 2°C, and reach around one-seventh of energy consumption
							under the baseline (Graph 9)."
"A number of export projects of green hydrogen have been proposed by industry
							– including the Western Green Energy Hub, a $100 billion project
							for the world's largest renewable energy hub in Western Australia. Japan
							has signalled plans to boost hydrogen and ammonia use under its decarbonisation
							plans, with a joint partnership under way to establish the world's
							first international hydrogen trade
							route. Several Japanese corporations
							have also increased investment into foreign green hydrogen projects, including
							in Australia. Green hydrogen also has the potential to be used in the domestic
							production of ‘green steel’, which can then be
							exported."
"Growing global demand for electric vehicles and batteries also provides opportunities
							for Australia to increase its exports of lithium, nickel, cobalt and other
							rare earth minerals. Australia also has the world's largest deposits of
							uranium; nuclear energy generation is projected to increase in some markets
							in the coming decades."
"The overall impact of reduced fossil fuel exports on GDP is expected to be
							relatively small and gradual. The direct contribution of fossil fuel exports
							to annual GDP growth would be on average 0.1 percentage points lower
							in the Net Zero scenario relative to the
							baseline. There would also be flow-on impacts to associated activity; however, these impacts
							are likely to be partly offset, over time, by opportunities in other sectors.
							One example is the renewable energy market, where investment has begun to
							support activity and employment, particularly in regional areas where large-scale
							renewable generators tend to be located (de Atholia, Flannigan and Lai 2020).
							However, the renewables export market is still at an early stage and the outlook
							is uncertain. More broadly, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which
							activity in other sectors could eventually offset a decline in activity related
							to fossil fuel production. Whatever happens, the impact of a decline in fossil
							fuel exports would be significant for certain communities and regions, especially
							those in which mining accounts for a large share of employment."
"The NGFS scenarios illustrate one of many possible paths for global emissions
							and fossil fuel consumption, but there is a large degree of uncertainty around
							how the global economy can transition to a lower-emissions world. Alternative
							plausible scenarios would result in a more (or less) favourable outlook for
							Australia's fossil fuel exports."
"The commitments by China, Japan and South Korea to achieve net-zero emissions
							by mid-century and the broader global shift towards carbon emission reduction
							puts downward pressure on the outlook for Australia's fossil fuel exports.
							Coal exports are projected to decline significantly, while the expected impact
							on LNG exports is more modest. Overall, the effect of net-zero emissions policies
							in these three economies on Australia's GDP is expected to be small and
							gradual, although it could be significant for directly affected sectors. However,
							significant uncertainty remains, including the speed and manner in which countries
							attempt to achieve net-zero emissions and technological developments that
							could change the efficiency and carbon intensity of fossil fuels."

									for work that laid the foundation for the international analysis in this
									article."
"South Korea's 24.4 per cent reduction by 2030 entails a 37 per cent
									reduction from a ‘business as usual’ path."
"‘Carbon intensity of output’ is the ratio of carbon emissions
									to real GDP. The Chinese Government does not have a 2030 target for real
									GDP that would allow for calculating an implied carbon emissions target.
									However, Chinese President Xi Jinping has suggested that authorities are
									aiming to double 2020 GDP by 2035 (Xinhua 2020a). Assuming underlying GDP
									growth moderates only gradually, that suggests that real GDP will be around
									two-thirds larger in 2030 than 2020. The carbon-intensity target would then
									suggest a 2030 target for carbon emissions around 6 per cent higher
									than the 2020 level. This estimate is used in Graph 4."
"Korea has pledged to permanently close 30 aging coal-fired power plants
									by 2034 (or convert to LNG), half of its current capacity, which will reduce
									coal-fired power generation capacity to 29 GW from 38.3 GW in
									2022 (Kumagai and Yep 2021). Japan's largest power generator will seek
									to shut down all inefficient older coal-fired power plants by 2030, or around
									13 per cent of existing capacity. In China's latest Five Year
									Plan, authorities have noted they will control the development of coal-fired
									capacity, continuing the trend of seeking to restrict new coal plant capacity
									from 2016 (Boulter 2018)."
"South Korea's scheme covers heavy polluters in the industrial and power
									sectors and has been in operation since 2015, while China's launched
									in mid 2021 after a number of years in development and various regional
									pilot programs. China's scheme has low initial coverage, low opening
									prices and a lack of an absolute cap on emissions, but coverage and prices
									are expected to increase in the coming years. Already the scheme covers
									around 40 per cent of China's emissions."
"Japan is seeking to ramp up its offshore wind capacity to 10 GW by 2030
									and GW offshore wind capacity by 2040, from around 65 MW
									currently (Ministry of Economic, Trade and Industry (Japan) 2020). This
									would make it the third-largest offshore wind generator in the world. South
									Korea recently announced plans to construct the world's largest offshore
									floating wind farm by 2030 (to generate up to 8.2 GW), a flagship project
									in South Korea's Green New Deal (Moon 2021)."
"Green hydrogen is a source of clean fuel produced using renewable energy,
									and ‘blue hydrogen’ produced from natural gas or coal, with
									the resulting carbon emissions captured and stored. Conventional methods
									of creating hydrogen are emissions intensive."
"In China, the government has mandated that electric vehicles make up 40 per cent
									of all sales by 2030. The industry has significant momentum after years
									of government subsidies, tax waivers and support for charging infrastructure.
									Japan is pioneering hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and buses, and has pledged
									to stop the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035."
"The International Energy Association suggests this is due to: the need for
									high-temperature heat; emissions that naturally result from conventional
									industrial processes; narrow profit margins that leave little room for firms
									to absorb the costs associated with adopting more expensive production options;
									and the fact that heavy industries use capital‐intensive equipment with
									long lives (30–40 years), slowing the uptake of innovative low‐emission
									technologies (International Energy Association 2021)."
"See Cunningham, Van Uffelen and Chambers (2019) for more information on Australia's
									coal exports."
"The NGFS is a group of over 90 central banks and supervisors including
									the RBA whose purpose is to share best practices, contribute to the development
									of climate and environment-related risk management in the financial sector
									and mobilise mainstream finance to support the transition towards a sustainable
									economy. The NGFS published its first set of climate scenarios in June 2020,
									which delivered a consistent set of transition pathways based on global
									policy responses, the energy network and the climate. The second vintage
									of the NGFS Climate Scenarios was published in June 2021, and included updated
									commitments by countries to reach net-zero emissions and greater region-level
									granularity. Three different ‘integrated assessment models’
									were used for each scenario to provide an estimated range. We rely on the
									Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) model as it provides the greatest
									country-level granularity for primary energy consumption."
"Fossil fuel exports to China, Japan and South Korea are individually calibrated
									based on their domestic fossil fuel demand profiles. Exports to the rest
									of the world are calibrated to change at the same rate as global aggregate
									fossil fuel demand (excluding China, Japan and South Korea) in the NGFS
									scenarios."
"For example, demand for Australian coal may decline by less in response to
									lower global coal consumption, particularly if tightening environmental
									standards support demand for higher-grade coal."
"Geoscience Australia estimates there to be 19,458 Mt of black coal Ore
									Reserves as of December 2019, 60 per cent of which are associated
									with operating mines. Ore Reserves are defined as an economically mineable
									part of a mineral resource, taking into consideration a range of factors
									including governmental and environmental regulations; this does not include
									a significant amount of mineral resources that can be converted into reserves
									(Geoscience Australia 2021)."
"This would require investment into large expansions of Australia's current
									LNG export capacity."
"Under the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain pilot, hydrogen produced from brown
									coal in Victoria's Latrobe Valley will be exported to Japan via a special
									vessel, with first shipments of liquefied hydrogen expected in October and
									March 2022 following -related delays (Department of Industry, Science, Energy
									and Resources 2021)."
"For example, Fortescue Metals Group is aiming to build Australia's first
									green steel project in the Pilbara, powered entirely by green hydrogen from
									local wind and solar in the next few years (Forrest 2021)."
"The cumulative fall in fossil fuel exports subtracts around 3 per cent
									off the level of GDP in 2050 relative to the baseline. Assumes real GDP
									to grow in line with RBA forecasts to 2023 (RBA 2021), then at the OECD's
									growth forecast to 2050 (OECD 2018)."
