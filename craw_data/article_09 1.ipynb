A credible and durable economic strategy in Asia is critical to advancing U.S. commercial, diplomatic, and strategic interests. The Biden framework holds promise in this regard but needs to be developed in a way that meets several tests: providing tangible benefits for both Americans and Indo-Pacific partners; advancing binding rules and hard commitments as well as broad principles; being managed in a coherent and coordinated way; and meeting the administration’s commitments to transparency and inclusiveness.

The United States has deep and abiding interests in the Indo-Pacific region, which accounts for roughly half the world’s population, economic output, and trade, and where there is a fierce competition over whose economic rules and norms will prevail. Other countries are actively negotiating trade agreements to establish regional rules and preferential access, while the United States largely sits on the sidelines. America’s allies and partners in the region view the U.S. military and diplomatic presence in the region as welcome but insufficient; they also expect the United States to be an active, reliable, and durable partner in regional economic affairs.\n",

The headline issues listed in the White House statement cover many important areas of U.S. and regional partner interest. While few details have been released, it appears that the administration views the IPEF not as a single undertaking, like a traditional trade agreement, but rather as a platform for separate negotiations on topics of interest, conducted at varying speeds, with different configurations of countries, and with an array of potential outcomes.\n",

This could be achieved by returning to a revised Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) or applying to join its successor agreement, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). TPP brought the United States together with 11 like-minded partners in the Indo-Pacific region to establish high-standard, binding rules on many of the issues that will shape America’s future prosperity and security, from the digital economy to the role of the state in the marketplace. Although former president Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in early 2017, leading U.S. allies and partners in the region, especially those in CPTPP, still hope that the United States will eventually return to a comprehensive, high-standard regional agreement like TPP. We also believe that there is more domestic political support for well-crafted trade agreements than is commonly assumed, as evidenced by the bipartisan congressional approval of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\n",

Translating those commitments into specific rules and obligations that countries would accept will be much more difficult and will require the United States to put something on the table as well.

In a number of the areas the administration has proposed under the framework, such as digital trade and climate, even an agreement among a small number of parties could be meaningful, and there is always the possibility of expanding the membership over time. The best outcome would be many countries making strong commitments in all the areas being negotiated.

First, Congress is ever mindful of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, giving it preeminence on trade policy, and does not usually regard a promise to consult as adequately meeting the requirements of that section. The administration might get away with it because Congress has no immediate recourse, but proceeding without congressional approval would surely become an issue later on when other trade issues come up.\n",

That in turn tells partners from the beginning that they have little to gain from the United States by negotiating any agreements under the IPEF.
